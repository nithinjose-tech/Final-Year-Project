On Saturday, \\nat the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, ``Pistol \\nPete'' and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger \\ngroup of marchers _ 450 people, many wearing yellow armbands and carrying \\nsigns in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who \\nsuffered severe head injuries in the attack last week. ``Hate is not \\na Small Town Value _ No to Violence and Evil,'' read one sign, as \\nwatchers applauded. With passersby spontaneously joining the protest \\ngroup, two women held another sign that read, ``No Hate Crimes in \\nWyoming.'' Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches \\nnear the campus. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., \\nwhere Shepard's health continued to deteriorate, the hospital has \\nreceived so many flowers that nurses have started to distribute bouquets \\nto other patients. A vigil at the hospital on Saturday evening drew \\nabout 500 people. ``We live in the Equality State,'' Shannon Rexroat \\nwrote Friday in a special edition of the Branding Iron, the campus \\nnewspaper. Referring to Wyoming's pioneer heritage as the first state \\nto grant women the right to vote, Ms. Rexroat, the campus newspaper's \\neditor added: ``That means nothing to me anymore. We live in a state \\nwhere a young man was brutally beaten because he is gay.'' But others \\nrecalled another side of ``Wyoming's hometown,''which has a population \\nof more than 26,000. Jamie Lewis, another editor, said that on Friday \\nhe was handing out copies of the special edition when a passerby backed \\naway from him and used an anti-gay epithet. Last week's brutal assault \\nbubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and \\nlesbians, leaders of the local Unitarian church said in a letter published \\nSunday in the city's newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang. ``This \\nincident was atypical in its brutality, but not in its underlying \\nmotive,'' wrote Jeffrey Lockwood and Stephen Johnson. Gay people in \\nLaramie, they wrote, ``are frequently assaulted with derision, intolerance, \\ninsult and hostility _ if not guns and ropes.'' Ric Turley, who dropped \\nout of college here after one year in the 1970s, recalled driving \\nhere to see his family for Christmas in 1993 and seeing a vandalized \\nbillboard on the main highway. Under a brace of pistols, an advertising \\nappeal for a state history museum had been changed, he said, from \\n``Shoot a Day or Two,'' to ``Shoot a Gay or Two.'' Turley, who is \\ngay and said he only came out after he had left Wyoming, said that \\nhe immediately complained to the museum. But returning a month later, \\nhe found the message had not been erased. After complaining to the \\nmuseum for a second time, he said he took a can of black spray paint \\nand blotted out the word ``gay.'' ``It was this kind of complacency \\nand apathy that allowed this to happen,'' he said of the beating in \\nwhich two local men have been charged, Russell Henderson and Aaron \\nMcKinney. According to the local police and prosecutors, the two men \\nlured Shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay. Then, the Laramie \\npolice say, the pair kidnapped Shepard, pistol-whipped him with a \\n.357 Magnum and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hours until \\na passing bicyclist spotted Shepard, who was unconscious. On Sunday, \\nthe Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday \\nat the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was being treated. \\nMcKinney was being treated for a ``minor'' skull fracture unrelated \\nto the fracas with Shepard, said Ben Fritzen, a Laramie police detective. \\nPresident Clinton has condemned the attack, saying on Saturday, ``I \\nwas deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew \\nShepard.'' Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes \\nPrevention Act, saying, ``There is nothing more important to the future \\nof this country than our standing together against intolerance, prejudice \\nand violent bigotry.'' Wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have \\na hate crime law. The latest attempt died in the state Legislature \\nin Cheyenne in February. On Saturday, Wyoming's governor, Jim Geringer, \\nsaid he was ``outraged and sickened'' by the attack. Here in Laramie, \\nMcKinney's father, Bill, also condemned the attack. His pickup truck \\nwas apparently used in the kidnapping. But he also complained about \\nthe massive attention by the national media. The national press ``blew \\nit totally out of proportion because it involved a homosexual,'' McKinney \\ntold The Denver Post. `Had this been a heterosexual these two boys \\ndecided to take out and rob, this never would have made the national \\nnews.'' Shepard grew up in Casper until his sophomore year in high \\nschool, when his father, an oil rig safety engineer, was transferred \\nto Saudi Arabia. The young man completed high school at a boarding \\nschool in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned Italian and German. \\nOn Saturday, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, released a statement \\nfrom Fort Collins thanking ``the American public for their kind thoughts \\nabout Matthew.'' ``He is a trusting person who takes everybody at \\nface value and he does not see the bad side of anyone,'' the Shepards \\nwrote. ``He has always strongly felt that all people are the same, \\nregardless of their sexual preference, race or religion.'' Noting \\nthat their son was born prematurely and that his ``life has often \\nbeen a struggle,'' they added, ``He is physically short in stature, \\nbut we believe he is a giant when it comes to respecting the worth \\nof others.'' \\n\\nMatthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead \\nof night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his \\nfuneral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. \\n``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had \\nsucceeded,'' his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily that \\nwas carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, \\nthrough a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed Presbyterian \\nchurch and across Casper on an AM radio station. ``Judging from the \\nworld's response,'' she said, ``Matt will have made a difference in \\nthe lives of thousands.'' As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed \\nCasper, fresh flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard \\nhad been baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white \\nrobes of an Episcopal acolyte. ``There is an image that comes to mind \\nwhen I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence,'' said the \\nRev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. ``I replace \\nthat image with that of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate \\non that man, I can release the bitterness inside.'' Shepard, a 21-year-old \\nfreshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one \\nday for human rights. In death, he has become a national catalyst \\nfor a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical \\nsafety. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens \\nof candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements \\nof sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution. \\nThursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a resolution \\nthat condemned Shepard's killing as ``outrageous'' and that urged \\neach member of Congress and every U.S. citizen ``to denounce this \\noutrageous murder of another human being.'' In one of the largest \\nrallies, about 1,000 people, including members of Congress of both \\nparties, gathered on the steps of the Capitol in Washington to condemn \\nShepherd's killing and to urge passage of a federal bill that would \\nadd extra penalties to crimes motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, \\ngender or disability. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage \\nof the bill, leading the crowd in a chant of ``Now! Now! Now.'' ``We \\nwill never forget the love that the world has shared with this kind, \\nloving son,'' said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his father, outside \\nCasper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by, weeping. He said \\nthe family was ``touched beyond measure'' by ``the thousands of e-mail \\ncomments, Web-site messages, phone calls and cards offering help, \\nconsolation, sympathy and support.'' Before the funeral, about a dozen \\nprotesters, largely from Kansas and Texas, waved signs with anti-homosexual \\nmessages. But mourners stood in front of them, singing ``Amazing Grace'' \\nand holding umbrellas to block the sight of the spectacle from friends \\nand family members entering the church. On hearing of the protest, \\nLaramie's City Council held an emergency meeting Thursday night and \\nunanimously passed an ordinance banning protests during funerals. \\nWyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay protesters \\nwere ``just flat not welcome.'' The governor, a Republican, added, \\n``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts coming in.'' Shepard was \\nborn in Casper and attended elementary school, junior high and several \\nyears of high school and college here. With flags at Casper's public \\nschools flying at half-staff Friday, many mourners were his old classmates. \\nOthers traveled here, one driving from as far away as New Jersey, \\nout of a sense of solidarity. ``I've had a pit in my heart and my \\nstomach since I heard this,'' said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 \\nmiles to wait three hours in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral \\nof a man he never met. ``I just wanted to pay my respects to him and \\nhis family.'' Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder \\nhas elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected quarters. \\nAt the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will wear \\nyellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of Shepard. Organizers \\nsaid that yellow signifies tolerance and green symbolizes peace. In \\nCasper, a conservative city of 51,000, located in the heart of Wyoming's \\noil belt, tolerance has become the watchword. ``Prejudice against \\nhomosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black bias,'` The Casper Star-Tribune, \\nWyoming's largest newspaper, wrote in its main editorial on Sunday. \\n``Violence against our homosexual friends and neighbors has created \\na most un-American climate of fear in Wyoming and the rest of the \\nnation.'' Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, \\nwrote lovingly that, ``Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not \\njust because we are both members of the loose-knit community of gay \\npeople striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place called \\nWyoming.'' ``Matt was very short and hard to hug,'' Marsden recalled \\nof the young man who had grown up in Casper. ``But it was worth trying, \\nbecause he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile frame.'' \\nIn a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the University \\nof Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate Oct. 7, attributed \\nthe chance discovery to ``God's plan.'' On that afternoon, Kreifels, \\nan 18-year-old architectural engineering student, had nearly completed \\na rigorous six-mile ride on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, \\nin public lands east of Laramie. Kreifels recalled in an interview \\nThursday that his only mishap of the ride, ``I hit this big limestone \\nrock and did one over the handlebars.'' Dusting himself off and looking \\naround in the fading light of the day, Kreifels recalled, ``I noticed \\nsomething out of my eye that looked like a scarecrow. I walked around \\nthe fence, and as I got closer, I noticed the hair.'' Shepard, his \\nhands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and tied to a fence \\npost, was lying on the ground, face up, unconscious. ``Sometimes I \\nwonder why I found him alive, if he was going to die,'' Kreifels reflected, \\nbefore traveling to spend this weekend at home with his parents in \\nGrand Island, Neb. ``But I guess God wanted his parents to be with \\nhim.'' \\n\\nAt first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to \\na ranch fence was a scarecrow. But when he stopped, he found the burned, \\nbattered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay \\ncollege student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier. On \\nFriday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma \\nin critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, \\n21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charges of kidnapping, \\naggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. Two women described \\nas friends of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera \\nPasley, 20, have been charged as accessories after the fact to attempted \\nfirst-degree murder. Shepard's friends said that he did not know his \\nalleged tormentors. Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery, \\nalthough court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality \\nmay also have been a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a hate \\ncrime. ``He was very open about his sexuality,'' Tina LaBrie, an anthropology \\nstudent here, said of her friend. ``I admired him for that because \\nit is very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree.'' \\nA few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch \\nman who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, \\nGay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend \\nof Shepard's. ``He was sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two \\nmen came up and talked to him,'' Boulden, a 46-year-old university \\nlecturer of social work here, said today between tears. ``He indicated \\nhe was gay, and they said they were gay, too.'' ``Now, he is in a \\ncoma,'' continued Boulden, who visited his friend at a hospital in \\nFort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. ``I don't think anybody expects \\nhim to pull through.'' Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied \\nat a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United \\nStates to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his \\nfather, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard \\nwas born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much \\nof his youth there. But six weeks after returning to Wyoming and enrolling \\nas a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie \\nand her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, \\nthis foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found \\nhimself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a treeless \\nlandscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle and a busy \\nfreight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup trucks outnumber \\nsport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolves around this \\nSaturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season \\nin the nearby Medicine Bow mountains. Although Wyoming often bills \\nitself as the ``equality state,'' in reference to its being the first \\nstate to give women the vote, the state legislature has repeatedly \\nvoted down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give \\nhomosexuals special rights. ``Wyoming is not really gay friendly,'' \\nMarv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American \\nCivil Liberties Union, said from Cheyenne. ``The best way to characterize \\nthat is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened \\nhomosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing \\nplant.'' Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university \\nwithin days. One of his favorite haunts was the Fireside Bar, which \\ndrew a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and \\nstraights. ``He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in,'' recalled \\nthe bartender, Matt Galloway. ``He wasn't drunk when he went out.'' \\nCalvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents today \\nthat McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard \\nout to McKinney's pickup truck. Beating him inside the truck, the \\npair drove him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural \\nsubdivision, the County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, \\nthe men tied their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped \\nhim with a .357 magnum ``while he begged for his life.'' Relatives \\nsaid that Shepard also suffered burns on his body. After nearly beating \\nthe young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, \\nthe assailants stole his wallet and shoes and left him tied to the \\nfence. The police commander said that when his officers arrested the \\ntwo men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a .357 \\nmagnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit card. \\nHe said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home. The police \\ncommander said that the two women helped the two men dump their bloody \\nclothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti-gay remarks. \\nMs. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, lived with Henderson. \\nMs. Price lived with McKinney. The police did not say what the other \\nthree did for a living. On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggled \\nto understand the incident. Shepard, some said, may have felt a false \\nsense of confidence because the local Gay Association completed plans \\non Tuesday night for ``Gay Awareness Week 1998.'' The weeklong series \\nof events starts here Sunday with a local observance of ``National \\nComing Out Day'' and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author \\nof ``Heather Has Two Mommies,'' a book about lesbian families. ``If \\nI were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low,'' said \\nCarla Brown, manager of the Fireside. ``Openly gay behavior is not \\nonly discouraged, it's dangerous.'' \\n\\nMatthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead \\nof night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his \\nfuneral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. \\n``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had \\nsucceeded,'' his cousin, the Rev.

From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out \\nto honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman \\nat the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of anti-gay \\nviolence after he was found dangling from the fence by a passerby. \\nTwo men and two women have been charged in the case. The men were \\ncharged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree \\nmurder charges that could bring the death penalty. ``There is incredible \\nsymbolism about being tied to a fence,'' said Rebecca Isaacs, political \\ndirector of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington. \\n``People have likened it to a scarecrow. But it sounded more like \\na crucifixion.'' Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives fear \\n_ that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures \\nto pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives \\ngenerally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights over \\nanother. In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia \\nhave passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are committed \\nbecause of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and \\nsexual orientation. Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not \\ninclude sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including \\nWyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all. In Washington, Clinton responded \\nto news of Shepard's death by urging Congress to pass the federal \\nHate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses of crimes \\nbased on sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming has been \\none of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills since \\n1994, most recently in February. But Monday, after Shepard's death, \\nGov. Jim Geringer appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. \\n``I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation \\nthat can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration \\nin January,'' Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning with \\nDennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and said that the elder \\nShepard did not want his son's death to become ``a media circus'' \\nand that ``we should not use Matt to further an agenda.'' Geringer \\nsaid that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into just passing \\nall kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of any changes \\nand be sure you're not taking away rights of others in the process \\nto race to this.'' Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday \\nsaid they would respect the family's privacy by not attending the \\nburial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped \\nthe death would have an impact on legislators around the nation. ``Matthew's \\ndeath, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding \\nof hate crime laws,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of \\nthe Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that has \\n250,000 members. ``Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming \\nand in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation.'' \\nIn 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States because \\nof their sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law \\nCenter, an Alabama group that tracks violence against minorities. \\nAccording to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor in 11.6 percent \\nof the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996. But Christian conservatives \\nwarn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights \\nlaws and to curtail freedom of speech. ``Hate crimes laws have nothing \\nto do with perpetrators of violent crime and everything to do with \\nsilencing political opposition,'' said Steven Schwalm, an analyst \\nwith the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to \\ndefending ``faith, family and freedom.'' ``It would criminalize pro-family \\nbeliefs,'' Schwalm said. ``This basically sends a message that you \\ncan't disagree with the political message of homosexual activists.'' \\nAgreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in a \\nseries of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne, ``overcame'' \\nhomosexuality through religious conversion. ``We have every right \\nto speak out against an agenda that is contrary to Biblical norms,'' \\nsaid Paulk, who describes himself as a homosexuality specialist for \\nFocus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. \\n``Because we are standing up and opposing the homosexual agenda, we \\nare being looked upon as advocating violence against homosexuals, \\nwhen we categorically reject violence against homosexuals.'' Last \\nThursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of television \\nadvertisements that preach the ``healing'' of homosexuality through \\nreligious conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements \\nhelp create a hostile climate for homosexuals, a climate that can \\nlead to violence. Hate crime laws that are on the books in 40 states \\nhave not impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal \\njustice professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at \\nStockton College, in Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws \\nsend a clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities. \\n``We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before they \\nescalate,'' he said. Referring to murders of homosexuals, he added: \\n``These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if they are \\nnot punished the first time.'' Levin said that his research indicated \\nthat homosexuals suffered higher rates of violent crime than the population \\nat large. He also said that roughly half of the people who attack \\nhomosexuals are male, aged 22 or younger. The two men charged in the \\nkilling of Shephard are both white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron \\nMcKinney, 22. ``With other crimes, violence is a means to an end. \\nWith hate crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal,'' Levin \\nsaid. Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, \\nas well as a massive blow to the back of his skull. ``Because their \\nsocial stature in society, gays are often viewed as appropriate targets,'' \\nLevin added. Citing the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message \\nto gay bashers, Levin said: ``The discourse in society leaves many \\nof these people to believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable.'' \\nWhile some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, \\nothers saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nailing \\na dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future intruders. ``This \\nUniversity of Wyoming student was beaten and left to die, tied to \\na fence like an animal because he was honest and open about being \\ngay,'' Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense \\nand Education Fund, said Monday, ``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering \\nand death cannot be dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated \\nindividuals. His attackers are among millions of Americans who constantly \\nhear the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic \\nequal treatment,'' Ms. Dorhn said. \\n\\nMatthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely \\nbeaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious \\non a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours \\nin near-freezing temperatures. His death, announced at Poudre Valley \\nHospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's \\nattack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes \\nlegislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws \\nin a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted \\nthem.

Their girlfriends, Chastity Pasley, 21, and \\nKristen Price, 18, were charged as accessories. In Denver, mourners \\nwrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of national Gay Awareness \\nWeek. In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the gay \\nrights movement was lowered to half-staff in the Castro district. \\n``There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence,'' said \\nRebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian \\nTask Force in Washington. ``People have likened it to a scarecrow. \\nBut it sounded more like a crucifixion.'' Police in Laramie, Wyo., \\nwhere the beating took place, have said they believed robbery was \\nthe primary motive for the attack against Shepard, which occurred \\noutside a bar in the town of 27,000. But investigators also said Shepard's \\nsexuality may have been a factor. Police said Henderson and McKinney \\nlured Shepard from the bar by saying they too were gay and one of \\ntheir girlfriends said Shepard had embarassed one of the men by making \\na pass at him. Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied \\nto the fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a \\nstreet corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy \\nHerrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the brawl; \\nMcKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same hospital \\nwhere Shepard died.

His attackers are among millions \\nof Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not \\nworthy of the most basic equal treatment,'' Ms. Dorhn said. \\n\\nOn the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, \\na 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung \\nup like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., \\nthe Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington. \\nIt was the latest salvo in a six-month campaign by the religious right, \\nwith the tacit, even explicit, approval of Republican leaders, to \\ndemonize gay people for political gain in this election year. This \\nparticular press conference was to announce a new barrage of ads _ \\na TV follow-up to a summer print campaign _ in which alleged former \\nhomosexuals who have ``changed'' implore others to do likewise ``through \\nthe power of Jesus Christ.'' The commercials, gooey in style, end \\nwith a slogan: ``It's not about hate ... It's about hope.'' But it's \\nreally about stirring up the fear that produces hate. If these ads \\nwere truly aimed at gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast at extravagant \\ncost to the wide general audience reached by TV, and they wouldn't \\nbe trumpeted in Washington, insuring free national exposure, three \\nweeks before Election Day. The ads themselves, despite the sugar-coating \\nof ``hope,'' ooze malice. In one of them, homosexuality is linked \\nto drug addiction and certain death by AIDS; all of them implicitly \\nposit that homosexuality is itself a disease in need of a cure. Matthew \\nShepard has now been ``cured,'' that's for sure. As his uncle, R.W. \\nEaton, told The Denver Post, the 21-year-old Matt, who aspired to \\na career in diplomacy and human rights, was ``a small person with \\na big heart, mind and soul that someone tried to beat out of him.'' \\nOf his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, ``It's like something you \\nmight see in war.'' And a war it is. Go to the Family Research Council's \\nWeb site and you will find a proud description of its readiness to \\n``wage the war against the homosexual agenda and fight to maintain \\nthe traditional meaning of `family.''' The head of the Family Research \\nCouncil is Gary Bauer, a GOP power broker and putative presidential \\ncandidate, who disingenuously goes on talk shows to say that his organization \\nhates no one and deplores violence. But if you wage a well-financed \\nmedia air war in which people with an innate difference in sexual \\norientation are ceaselessly branded as sinful and diseased and un-American \\nseekers of ``special rights,'' ground war will follow. It's a story \\nas old as history. Once any group is successfully scapegoated as a \\nsubhuman threat to ``normal'' values by a propaganda machine, emboldened \\nthugs take over. Two weeks after James Byrd was savagely dragged to \\nhis death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about \\nan ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where \\na mob threatened a group of gay Log Cabin Republicans who were protesting \\ndiscriminatory treatment by their own party. The gay-bashers had been \\ndirectly preceded by steady saber-rattling from Republican politicians: \\nSen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma had likened James Hormel, a gay nominee \\nto an ambassadorship, to David Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered on \\nTV if God might wreak havoc on Disney World for its ``Gay Days''; \\nthe Texas GOP spokesman had likened Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan. \\nJust two days after this near-brush with violence in Fort Worth, Trent \\nLott was on TV seconding the religious right's condemnation of gay \\npeople as sinful and sick. A frightened gay Texas Republican who had \\nbeen at the convention melee asked when I interviewed him then: ``Do \\nyou have to have someone hurt and beat up and dragged from a truck \\nto stop this?'' Months later not even the murder in Laramie has moved \\nLott to apologize for his words, and still no major GOP leader dares \\ntake on its ``religious'' wing and its crusade against people like \\nMatthew Shepard. In one of the new ads in that supposedly hate-free \\ncrusade, an ostensibly loving mother condemns her son for the ``bad \\nchoice'' of being gay. Is it that mother who speaks for American values, \\nor is it Matthew's? ``Go home, give your kids a hug,'' Judy Shepard \\nsaid in a message read by a tearful hospital spokesman who announced \\nher child's death early Monday morning, ``and don't let a day go by \\nwithout telling them you love them.'' \\n\\nLast Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, \\na college homecoming parade passed a few blocks from his hospital \\nbed in Fort Collins. Propped on a fraternity float was a straw-haired \\nscarecrow, labeled in black spray paint: ``I'm Gay.'' Few people missed \\nthe message. Three days earlier, Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming \\nfreshman, was savagely beaten and tied to a ranch fence in such a \\nposition that a passerby first mistook him for a scarecrow. Tuesday, \\nofficials at Colorado State University reacted with outrage to the \\nfraternity float, opening an investigation and disciplinary procedures \\nagainst the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha. The fraternity chapter immediately \\nsuspended seven members and said they had acted independently. But \\nin a week when candlelight vigils for Shepard were being held on campuses \\nacross the nation, the scarecrow incident highlighted how hostility \\ntoward gay people often flourishes in high schools and universities, \\ngay leaders said Tuesday. ``People would like to think that what happened \\nto Matthew was an exception to the rule but, it was an extreme version \\nof what happens in our schools on a daily basis,'' said Kevin Jennings, \\nexecutive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, \\na New York group dedicated to ending anti-gay bias in the schools. \\nShepard, a slightly built 21-year-old, died on Monday morning from \\nthe injuries suffered in the beating. He never regained consciousness \\nafter being discovered on the evening of Oct. 7, 18 hours after he \\nwas lashed to the fence. Two men, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron \\nMcKinney, 22, were arraigned late Monday night on first-degree murder \\ncharges. Their girlfriends, Chasity Pasley, 20, and Kristen Price, \\n18, have been arraigned as accessories after the fact. In response \\nto the killing, about 50 candelight vigils were scheduled this week, \\nfrom Texas to Vermont, from Wayne, Neb., to New York City. At the \\nPoudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was in intensive \\ncare for five days, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, received \\nabout 6,000 electronic messages of condolences. Tuesday, when funeral \\narrangements were announced for Friday in Casper, Wyo., the hospital \\nWeb site received 30,000 hits an hour. Friends at the University of \\nWyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set up The Matthew Shepard Memorial \\nFund to raise money to pressure the state legislature to pass anti-hate \\ncrime legislation. ``I see his name going down in gay history as a \\ncatalyst for renewed activism,'' said Matt Foreman, a former Wyomingite \\nwho directs Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay political organization \\nin New York. From around the nation Tuesday, gay leaders stressed \\nthat campus homophobia is not restricted to college towns in the Rocky \\nMountain West. Last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts \\nhigh school students, 22 percent of gay respondents said they skipped \\nschool in the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 \\npercent said they had been threatened or injured at school in the \\npast year. These percentages were about five times greater than the \\npercentages of heterosexual respondents. The survey was conducted \\nat 58 high schools by the Massachusetts Department of Education. In \\na separate study of nearly 500 community college students in the San \\nFrancisco area, 32 percent of male respondents said they had verbally \\nthreatened gay people and 18 percent said they had physically threatened \\nor assaulted gay people. The study was conducted this year by Karen \\nFranklin, a forensic psychologist who is a researcher at the University \\nof Washington. Surveys of gay college students conducted in the late \\n1980s at Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and \\nPenn State found that 16 percent to 26 percent had been threatened \\nwith violence, and that 40 percent to 76 percent had been verbally \\nharassed, said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobbying \\ngroup based in Washington. Last year, a student group in Des Moines, \\nIowa, called Concerned Students, recorded hallway and classroom conversations \\nat five high schools on 10 ``homophobia recording day.'' They estimated \\nthat the average Des Moines high school student hears about 25 anti-gay \\nremarks every day. ``Nine out of 10 `teaching tolerance' courses weed \\nout gays,'' Foreman said. ``There are a lot of people preaching anti-racism \\nand anti-semitism. But it is still very much OK to make anti-gay jokes, \\nto express anti-gay sentiments.'' In a survey of the nation's 42 largest \\nschool districts, 76 percent do not train teachers on issues facing \\ngay students, and 42 percent do not have policies to protect students \\nfrom discrimination based on sexual orientation, said the Gay, Lesbian \\nand Straight Education Network, which conducted the survey last month. \\nIn Fort Collins, while hospital officials struggled with an electronic \\navalanche of condolences, city police detectives were investigating \\na different kind of e-mail. On Monday, hours after Shepard's death, \\ntwo gay organizations, the Rainbow Chorus and the Lambda Community \\nCenter, received identical messages applauding Shepard's murder. The \\nmessages closed with the words: ``I hope it happens more often.'' \\n\\nAt first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to \\na ranch fence was a scarecrow. But when he stopped, he found the burned, \\nbattered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay \\ncollege student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier. On \\nFriday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma \\nin critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, \\n21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charges of kidnapping, \\naggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. Two women described \\nas friends of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera \\nPasley, 20, have been charged as accessories after the fact to attempted \\nfirst-degree murder. Shepard's friends said that he did not know his \\nalleged tormentors. Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery, \\nalthough court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality \\nmay also have been a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a hate \\ncrime. ``He was very open about his sexuality,'' Tina LaBrie, an anthropology \\nstudent here, said of her friend. ``I admired him for that because \\nit is very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree.'' \\nA few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch \\nman who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, \\nGay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend \\nof Shepard's. ``He was sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two \\nmen came up and talked to him,'' Boulden, a 46-year-old university \\nlecturer of social work here, said today between tears. ``He indicated \\nhe was gay, and they said they were gay, too.'' ``Now, he is in a \\ncoma,'' continued Boulden, who visited his friend at a hospital in \\nFort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. ``I don't think anybody expects \\nhim to pull through.'' Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied \\nat a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United \\nStates to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his \\nfather, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard \\nwas born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much \\nof his youth there. But six weeks after returning to Wyoming and enrolling \\nas a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie \\nand her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, \\nthis foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found \\nhimself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a treeless \\nlandscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle and a busy \\nfreight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup trucks outnumber \\nsport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolves around this \\nSaturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season \\nin the nearby Medicine Bow mountains. Although Wyoming often bills \\nitself as the ``equality state,'' in reference to its being the first \\nstate to give women the vote, the state legislature has repeatedly \\nvoted down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give \\nhomosexuals special rights. ``Wyoming is not really gay friendly,'' \\nMarv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American \\nCivil Liberties Union, said from Cheyenne. ``The best way to characterize \\nthat is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened \\nhomosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing \\nplant.'' Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university \\nwithin days. One of his favorite haunts was the Fireside Bar, which \\ndrew a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and \\nstraights. ``He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in,'' recalled \\nthe bartender, Matt Galloway. ``He wasn't drunk when he went out.'' \\nCalvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents today \\nthat McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard \\nout to McKinney's pickup truck just after midnight early Wednesday. \\nBeating him inside the truck, the pair drove him one mile southeast \\nto an isolated part of a new rural subdivision, the County Attorney's \\nreport charged. There, it said, the men tied their captive to a post-and-rail \\nfence and pistol-whipped him with a .357 magnum ``while he begged \\nfor his life.'' Relatives said that Shepard also suffered burns on \\nhis body. After nearly beating the young man to death, Laramie Police \\nCommander David O'Malley said, the assailants stole his wallet and \\nshoes and left him tied to the fence. The police commander said that \\nwhen his officers arrested the two men on Thursday, they found in \\nMcKinney's pickup truck a .357 magnum pistol covered with blood and \\nShepard's shoes and credit card. He said they found Shepard's wallet \\nat McKinney's home. The police commander said that the two women helped \\nthe two men dump their bloody clothing, and that they reported hearing \\nthe men make anti-gay remarks. Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student \\nat the university, lived with Henderson. Ms. Price lived with McKinney. \\nThe police did not say what the other three did for a living. On Friday, \\nfriends and Laramie residents struggled to understand the incident. \\nShepard, some said, may have felt a false sense of confidence because \\nthe local Gay Association completed plans on Tuesday night for ``Gay \\nAwareness Week 1998.'' The weeklong series of events starts here Sunday \\nwith a local observance of ``National Coming Out Day'' and a lecture \\non Monday by Leslea Newman, the author of ``Heather Has Two Mommies,'' \\na book about lesbian families. ``If I were a homosexual in Laramie, \\nI would hang low, very low,'' said Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. \\n``Openly gay behavior is not only discouraged, it's dangerous.'' \\n\\nMatthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead \\nof night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his \\nfuneral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. \\n``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had \\nsucceeded,'' his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily that \\nwas carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, \\nthrough a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed Presbyterian \\nchurch and across Casper on an AM radio station. ``Judging from the \\nworld's response,'' she said, ``Matt will have made a difference in \\nthe lives of thousands.'' As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed \\nCasper, fresh flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard \\nhad been baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white \\nrobes of an Episcopal acolyte. ``There is an image that comes to mind \\nwhen I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence,'' said the \\nRev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. ``I replace \\nthat image with that of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate \\non that man, I can release the bitterness inside.'' Shepard, a 21-year-old \\nfreshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one \\nday for human rights. In death, he has become a national catalyst \\nfor a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical \\nsafety. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens \\nof candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements \\nof sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution. \\nThursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a resolution \\nthat condemned Shepard's killing as ``outrageous'' and that urged \\neach member of Congress and every U.S. citizen ``to denounce this \\noutrageous murder of another human being.'' In one of the largest \\nrallies, about 1,000 people, including members of Congress of both \\nparties, gathered on the steps of the Capitol in Washington to condemn \\nthe Shepherd's killing and to urge passage of a federal bill that \\nwould add extra penalties to crimes motivated by a victim's sexual \\norientation, gender or disability. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt \\nurged passage of the bill, leading the crowd in a chant of ``Now! \\nNow! Now.'' ``We will never forget the love that the world has shared \\nwith this kind, loving son,'' said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his \\nfather, outside Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by, weeping. \\nHe said the family was ``touched beyond measure'' by ``the thousands \\nof e-mail comments, Web-site messages, phone calls and cards offering \\nhelp, consolation, sympathy and support.'' Before the funeral, about \\na dozen protesters, largely from Kansas and Texas, waved signs with \\nanti-homosexual messages. But mourners stood in front of them, singing \\n``Amazing Grace'' and holding umbrellas to block the sight of the \\nspectacle from friends and family members entering the church. On \\nhearing of the protest, Laramie's City Council held an emergency meeting \\nThursday night and unanimously passed an ordinance banning protests \\nduring funerals. Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that \\nanti-gay protesters were ``just flat not welcome.'' The governor, \\na Republican, added, ``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts coming \\nin.'' Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior \\nhigh and several years of high school and college here. With flags \\nat Casper's public schools flying at half-staff Friday, many mourners \\nwere his old classmates. Others traveled here, one driving from as \\nfar away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity. ``I've had a \\npit in my heart and my stomach since I heard this,'' said Steve Pietrangelo, \\nwho drove 300 miles to wait three hours in cold rain and snow to attend \\nthe funeral of a man he never met. ``I just wanted to pay my respects \\nto him and his family.'' Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's \\nmurder has elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected \\nquarters. At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players \\nwill wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of \\nShepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green \\nsymbolizes peace. In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located \\nin the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the watchword. \\n``Prejudice against homosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black bias,'` \\nThe Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote in its \\nmain editorial on Sunday. ``Violence against our homosexual friends \\nand neighbors has created a most un-American climate of fear in Wyoming \\nand the rest of the nation.'' Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's \\npolitical reporter, wrote lovingly that, ``Matthew Shepard is still \\nmy friend, and not just because we are both members of the loose-knit \\ncommunity of gay people striving to make our way in this sometimes \\nhostile place called Wyoming.'' ``Matt was very short and hard to \\nhug,'' Marsden recalled of the young man who had grown up in Casper. \\n``But it was worth trying, because he'd hug you with everything in \\nhis little, fragile frame.'' In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron \\nKreifels, the University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered \\nclassmate Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to ``God's plan.'' \\nOn that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural engineering \\nstudent, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride on a mountain \\nbike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public lands east of Laramie. Kreifels \\nrecalled in an interview Thursday that his only mishap of the ride, \\n``I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the handlebars.'' \\nDusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of the \\nday, Kreifels recalled, ``I noticed something out of my eye that looked \\nlike a scarecrow. I walked around the fence, and as I got closer, \\nI noticed the hair.'' Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with \\na nylon cord and tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face \\nup, unconscious. ``Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he \\nwas going to die,'' Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend \\nthis weekend at home with his parents in Grand Island, Neb. ``But \\nI guess God wanted his parents to be with him.'' \\n\", \"\\nBent on revenge for earlier attacks on churches, mobs set fire to \\nfour mosques in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands \\nof Christians degenerated into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader \\nsaid. A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school. \\nTroops and riot police patrolled the streets. There were no immediate \\nreports of serious injuries or arrests as fighting between Muslims \\nand Christians continued after dark, said a military officer who spoke \\nby telephone on condition of anonymity. The violence in the Christian-dominated \\ncity of Kupang was in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of \\n22 churches by Muslim mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when \\n14 people were killed. Islamic leaders urged Indonesia's Muslim majority \\nnot to retaliate with more violence. Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's \\nlargest Muslim grouping, the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accused \\nprovocateurs of whipping up religious strife when the sprawling Southeast \\nAsian nation is trying to head toward democracy. ``I hope Muslims \\n... are not deceived by such provocations,'' said Wahid, who has been \\npushing for religious unity. West Timor shares the same island as \\ntroubled East Timor, a former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman \\nCatholicism and invaded by Indonesia in 1975. Christians, mostly Protestants, \\ndominate Kupang, about 1,875 kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of \\nthe Indonesian capital. However, a sizable Muslim minority also lives \\nthere. The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged \\na peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church attacks. \\nMost offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, the capital \\nof East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor called for calm. Organizers \\nof Monday's strike had called for a non-violent ``day of mourning.'' \\nHowever, residents said fires broke out in three mosques after rival \\ngangs pelted each other with rocks. Indonesia is the world's most \\npopulous Islamic nation. About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million \\npeople are Muslims, with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist \\nor other faiths. Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined \\nin the national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia \\ndeclared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945. The upsurge \\nin religious violence follows months of riots and protests in many \\nparts of Indonesia. Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast Asian \\nnation have intensified as it grapples with its worst economic crisis \\nin decades. There is also political turmoil as students protesters \\ndemand greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former \\nPresident Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in \\nMay. Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition \\nUnited Development Party, urged his followers not to hit back. More \\nthan 100,000 party supporters filled a sports stadium in Jakarta Sunday \\nat the opening of a four-day convention. Religious strife erupted \\nrecently in the eastern part of the main island of Java, where more \\nthan 150 people, many of them Islamic clerics, have been murdered, \\napparently by rival Muslim groups. Many of the dead were accused of \\npracticing black magic. \\n\\nIn a decision welcomed as a landmark by Portugal, European Union leaders \\nSaturday backed calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East \\nTimor, the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia since 1975. \\n``A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible \\nwithout free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese \\npeople,'' the 15 EU leaders said in statement after their year-end \\nsummit. Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement \\nmarked the first time the EU had backed Lisbon's call for the East \\nTimorese to vote on whether to opt for independence or remain under \\nIndonesian rule. Indonesia has resisted such calls for a referendum \\nand maintains thousands of troops to keep order in the half-island \\nterritory. The EU statement also urged Indonesia to bring about a \\n``real and substantial reduction'' in troop levels and called for \\nthe establishment of a permanent U.N. presence in East Timor. The \\nleaders repeated a demand that Indonesia release jailed Timorese rebel \\nleader Xanana Gusmao, and all political prisoners. Indonesia invaded \\nEast Timor in 1975 as Portugal prepared to grant independence, and \\nannexed it the following year. The United Nations does not recognize \\nIndonesian rule. \\n\\nIndonesia on Tuesday denied claims that its troops massacred more \\nthan 40 East Timorese recently, and criticized Portugal for suspending \\nU.N.-sponsored talks over the future of the troubled territory. Foreign \\nMinister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly wanted to settle \\nthe problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, the official \\nAntara news agency reported. Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia \\nin New York last week following reports of a massacre of dozens of \\nEast Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops. \\nEast Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, \\nhas said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed near \\nthe villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast \\nof Dili, East Timor capital. The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner said \\nthat so far, only 11 bodies had been identified. Alatas said the claims \\nof a massacre were not true. ``The Portuguese delegation, without \\nchecking the truth of the information, decided to temporarily suspend \\nthe ongoing dialogue,'' Antara quoted Alatas as saying. The New York-based \\ngroup Human Rights Watch said some deaths had occurred in fights between \\nrebels and Indonesian forces. However, it could not confirm claims \\nthat dozens of people had been killed. Alatas said it was the third \\ntime that Portugal had unilaterally suspended talks over East Timor \\nsince 1986. Based on this, Alatas said, Indonesia was skeptical about \\nPortugal's sincerity, Antara reported. In response, Portugal's Foreign \\nMinistry accused Indonesia of breaking promises to reduce its military \\npresence in East Timor and called for a permanent U.N. mission in \\nthe disputed territory. ``Unfortunately, Indonesia has increased its \\ndeployment and the brutality of its military actions in East Timor,'' \\nsaid ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar. Meanwhile, about 500 students \\nended their noisy but peaceful rally outside the office of East Timor's \\ngovernor in Dili Tuesday after receiving promises that the reported \\nkillings would be investigated. In a dialogue with the students' representatives, \\nGovernor Abilio Osorio Soares and military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman \\nagreed to set up a team to make a thorough investigation. The group \\nearlier had spent one night occupying the provincial Parliament and \\nvowed to stay at the governor's office. The students also demanded \\na total withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers from East Timor. Meanwhile, \\nan unidentified man, believed to be a rebel, was reported to have \\nshot and wounded Izildo Pereira, a civilian, in Baucau, 100 kilometers \\n(62 miles) east of Dili. Izildo, 30, who was shot Sunday, was being \\ntreated at a military hospital in Dili. Indonesia invaded East Timor \\nin 1975 and annexed it the following year. The United Nations, however, \\ndoes not recognize Indonesia's claim. Before being suspended, the \\ntalks centered on an Indonesian offer to give East Timor autonomy \\nin return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty \\nthere. \\n\\nJAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - As a U.N. envoy trotted toward an Indonesian \\narmy helicopter, East Timorese protesters spilled onto the runway \\ntarmac and shouted their anger at nervous soldiers. Sent to make peace \\nin Indonesian-controlled East Timor, Jamsheed Marker's recent hasty \\ndeparture from the troubled territory signaled how easily tensions \\nthere can boil over. Yet Marker, who is visiting Indonesia to promote \\na U.N.-designed blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony, \\nsaid Monday that both sides in the bitter conflict were displaying \\na newfound taste for compromise. In an interview with The Associated \\nPress, Marker admitted that a peaceful solution remains distant. But \\nin a big step forward, he said, many separatist activists were no \\nlonger pressing for an immediate vote on independence. ``They don't \\nwant independence tomorrow,'' said Marker, who was interviewed in \\na Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor. In other progress, \\nIndonesia and Portugal will send diplomats to open ``interest'' sections \\nin each other's capitals next month. Formal diplomatic relations, \\nhowever, will not be resumed. Also in January, the two countries are \\nscheduled to embark on a new round of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in \\nNew York. Turmoil has plagued East Timor ever since Indonesian troops \\ninvaded in 1975, unleashing a separatist rebel war and the resentment \\nof a population pummeled by human rights abuses. Talks were revived \\nearlier this year after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto, \\nbut differences remain over a definition of autonomy that would suit \\nall parties. Separatists want it to be transitional, while Indonesia \\nis offering East Timorese partial control of their affairs in exchange \\nfor international recognition of its sovereignty. Jakarta wants to \\nhandle foreign, defense and financial affairs. Fears are widespread \\nthat more unrest in East Timor could derail the negotiations. On Monday, \\nMarker voiced his concern in a meeting with East Timor's jailed rebel \\nchief, Xanana Gusmao. ``I said there was a lot of tension in East \\nTimor and that he and his people ought to do everything they can to \\nreduce it,'' said Marker, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United \\nNations. Tempers flared but there was no violence during protests \\ntimed for Marker's weekend trip to Dili, the seaside capital of the \\nhalf-island territory of 800,000 people. On Sunday, separatist protesters \\ntore down a fence at the commercial airport and pushed past soldiers \\nwith automatic rifles as they tried in vain to speak to Marker as \\nhe left. During a visit last year, Indonesian soldiers killed two \\npro-independence demonstrators outside a hotel where Marker was staying. \\nActivists have alleged that Indonesia secretly ferried troops into \\nEast Timor in spite of pledges to reduce the number. Marker said Jakarta \\nhad advised him of troop rotations and that U.N. staff were monitoring \\nthe situation. Marker was scheduled to talk with Indonesian President \\nB.J. Habibie on Tuesday and will leave Indonesia on Wednesday to prepare \\nfor another batch of meetings in the New Year. ``If you ask me... \\n`Do you have a solution?' then the answer is, `I don't,''' he said. \\n``But I think there are ways of getting there and the first thing \\nis to have peace and quiet.'' \\n\\nProtesters on Sunday urged Australian military leaders to identify \\nIndonesian army officers trained here to allow closer monitoring of \\nhuman rights abuses in East Timor. The Australian military holds joint \\ntraining exercises with Indonesian troops, including the elite commando \\nunits accused ot atrocities in East Timor. In Queensland, about 100 \\nactivists gathered outside the Canungra Land Warfare Center, south \\nof Brisbane, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the Indonesian invasion \\nof East Timor. ``It is a peaceful protest against Australia training \\nIndonesian soldiers,'' spokesman Jason McLeod said. The protesters \\nwanted Australia to cut all military ties with Indonesia despite Defence \\nMinister John Moore's recent announcement that joint exercises would \\nresume, he said. ``The Australian government has repeatedly refused \\nto allow the Indonesians trained here to be identified,'' McLeod said. \\n``But we are demanding they be named along with their unit and battalion \\nnumber because this will allow closer monitoring of human rights issues,'' \\nhe said. McLeod said 40,000 East Timorese were killed by Japanese \\nsoldiers for protecting Australian commandos during World War II. \\n``When they finally left the country the Australians distributed leaflets \\nsaying they would never forget the people of East Timor,'' he said. \\nThe protesters wanted to remind Australia's current soldiers of that \\npledge.

Ramos-Horta is an advocate of independence for Indonesian-controlled \\nEast Timor, and newspapers reported Taiwan had formerly barred him \\nto avoid antagonizing Indonesia. But Ramos-Horta's previous persona \\nnon grata status had been ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in \\nAugust, leaving no reason why he should have been refused entry by \\nairport immigration when he came to town Wednesday night, ministry \\nspokesman Roy Wu told a news conference. ``This incident accentuated \\nthe problem with administrative relations, it needs to be improved. \\n... It's a fact,'' Wu told a news conference. Ramos-Horta had a rough \\ntime Wednesday night. Immigration officials would not let him in, \\nthen he tried to catch a flight out but missed the plane. Eventually, \\nthe Foreign Ministry intervened and let Ramos-Horta enter Taiwan. \\nHe went only as far as the airport hotel. Conflicting reports indicate \\nRamos-Horta was stuck at the airport for between four and seven hours. \\nRamos-Horta was carrying a Portuguese passport, which should have \\npermitted him visa-free entry to Taiwan for up to 14 days, newspapers \\nsaid. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party alleged Ramos-Horta \\nhad been refused entry because he planned to speak on behalf of Chen \\nShui-bian's campaign to be re-elected as mayor of Taipei. Chen is \\nTaiwan's most prominent DPP politician. ``This sort of incident shows \\nthat Taiwan is just not qualified to be called a democratic nation,'' \\nDPP Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen told a news conference.

The 3,500-page \\nreport by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more \\nthan two years of nationwide hearings. South African media released \\npreliminary findings on Monday, three days before its official release \\non Thursday in Pretoria, the capital. The release of the document \\nis a milestone in South Africa's transformation from white minority \\nrule to democracy. The commission, which has the power to grant amnesty, \\nwas tasked with promoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and \\nwhy of apartheid-era atrocities. With the ANC now in power and facing \\nan election in mid-1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove \\ndamaging both to its electoral chances and moral standing. There has \\nbeen no doubt that the report's overwhelming blame would be laid on \\nwhite governments and their security forces during the years under \\nscrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news reports Monday said the Truth Commission \\nwould declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that \\nthe ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting \\na legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state. But in preliminary \\nfindings sent to the parties last month, the commission also said \\nthe two movements were ``morally and politically accountable'' for \\ngross rights violations, South African Press Association and South \\nAfrican Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding said that \\ndespite ANC policy against killing civilians, the line between military \\nand civilian targets had been blurred, SAPA said. It condemned the \\nplanting of landmines in rural areas, the execution of enemy agents, \\ntorture and mistreatment of ANC members in its exile camps and for \\nkilling political opponents. It said the party must accept responsibility \\nfor the activities of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, \\nNelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, \\naccused of killings, torture and kidnappings. The commission also \\nsaid the PAC was guilty of the deaths of civilians in its strategy \\nin 1993 to drive white farmers off their land so it could be reclaimed \\nby blacks. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists in Pretoria, \\nwould not comment on the news reports about condemnation of the ANC. \\n``I do expect various responses (to the report). I do not expect everyone \\nto agree. It will lead to healthy debate,'' he said. He said that \\nif the commissioners recommends prosecutions against anyone for abuses, \\nit will be up to the national director of prosecutions to decide whether \\nto proceed. The director is appointed by the government. The commission's \\nwork is designed ``to help us establish the rule of law in South Africa, \\nand to establish the principle of accountability,'' Omar said. The \\nANC already has prepared the ground for a negative finding, saying \\nweeks ago that the commission had warned that harsh judgments were \\nin the offing. The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request \\na meeting with commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, \\nto avoid appearing biased. On Monday, it rejected ``with contempt'' \\nsuggestions ANC officials themselves had leaked the findings. Constand \\nViljoen, leader of the tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said the ANC \\nhad done so to give the commission credibility by making it more even-handed. \\nPublicly, the party has long defended its actions as those committed \\nduring a ``just war.'' F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president, \\nmeanwhile, planned to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission \\nreport from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored terror. \\n``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar said, \\nbut added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay. \\n\\nThe New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page \\nreport of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released \\non Thursday, is the most comprehensive and unsparing examination of \\na nation's ugly past that any such commission has yet produced. Drawing \\nfrom the commission's own investigations and the testimony of hundreds \\nof applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims, the report is a detailed \\nlook at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white \\ngovernments for the vast majority. It has fulfilled its mandate of \\ntelling the fullest truth possible, which is one reason that every \\npolitical party in South Africa has denounced it. Besides accusing \\nthe government of assassinations and bombings, the report criticizes \\nthe Inkatha Freedom Party for its massacres and collaboration with \\nsecurity forces, and blames the African National Congress for the \\nmurder of civilians and other crimes. It singles out former President \\nP.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, and Winnie \\nMandela, among others, for detailed treatment of their roles in political \\ncrimes. One major flaw in the report is the absence of a section accusing \\nF.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid president, of knowing about several \\nbombings after the fact and keeping silent. It was excised because \\nde Klerk is suing the commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, \\nto stop publication. The lawsuits are a disappointing sign that South \\nAfrica's political parties are not interested in an honest look at \\ntheir past, nor in the free flow of information. The controversy has \\nadded to widespread complaints that the commission has not helped \\nthe process of reconciliation. This is wrong. True reconciliation \\n_ which occurs when a society is no longer paralyzed by the past and \\npeople can work and live together _ cannot be based on silence. No \\nsociety can be restored to health by papering over as much pain as \\nSouth Africans have suffered. A noisy and informed debate about complicity \\nin the crimes of the apartheid era is necessary, if uncomfortable. \\nThe report is only part of the Truth Commission's contribution to \\nthe healing process. The hearings themselves, which allowed victims \\nof human rights violations to tell their stories in public, helped \\nthe country heal and opened the eyes of many whites to the unpleasant \\ntruth about apartheid. The amnesty process, while permitting many \\nimportant criminals to escape justice, is allowing families to know \\nexactly what happened to their loved ones in dozens of cases that \\nwould likely have never gone to trial in South Africa's fragile judicial \\nsystem. The process of helping the victims with scholarships and other \\nnecessary aid goes on, although it will not be enough. No commission \\ncan transform a society as twisted as South Africa's was. But the \\nTruth Commission is the best effort the world has seen, and South \\nAfrica is the better for it. \\n\\nTorturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting \\napartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, \\nan expert for South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing \\nlocal and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research \\nhead of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the \\npsychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could \\nalienate a potentially dangerous sector of society. ``We must give \\nattention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of \\nperpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a whole,'' he said. \\nThe conference, organized by the Medical Research Council, is examining \\nmental health issues raised by the Truth Commission, which is charged \\nwith probing crimes committed by all sides in the anti-apartheid struggle. \\nAs the commission prepares to hand over its final report at the end \\nof the month, South Africans are examining its painful and traumatic \\nexploration of their bloody past. With the power to grant amnesty \\nto many who tortured, bombed or maimed innocent civilians, the process \\nhas at some stage angered people in nearly all walks of life. Many \\nwhites see the panel as favoring the black liberation movements, while \\nmany blacks accuse it of being too soft on former state officials, \\nespecially top ranking ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed \\nfor tolerance in dealing with all those who have committed crimes, \\nsaying that the potential for wrongdoing existed in everyone. ``We \\nall, the entire human race, carry with us the capacity for evil,'' \\nhe said. Many of Thursday's speakers touched on the figure of police \\ndeath squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail terms totaling \\nmore than 200 years after a killing spree that costs dozens of lives. \\nDe Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes. Dan Stein, a specialist \\nin neurobiology and stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers \\nfrom all sides in the conflict by his sheer ``banality of evil''. \\n``Many people have found him in interviews to be an ordinary, even \\nlikeable person,'' he said about the man whom subordinates dubbed \\n``Prime Evil.'' Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter \\nwas gunned down by black activists in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town \\nbar, said it was necessary to help those whose circumstances compelled \\nthem to do wrong. Struggling to control her tears, Fourie told delegates \\nshe had attended the amnesty hearings of her daughter's killers and \\nsupported their successful bid to be freed from long jail sentences. \\nAfter describing how she hugged the three members of the black nationalist \\nPan-Africanist Congress and urged them to seek counseling together \\nwith their victims, Fourie earned a standing ovation from the 50-strong \\naudience. ``We must take the initiative in understanding others and \\nstart the process of reconciliation and healing our broken land,'' \\nshe said, her voice shaking with emotion. \\n\\nThe deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered \\nwas simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you \\nwill go free. If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. After \\nmore than two years of hearings into apartheid-era atrocities, the \\ncommission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report naming dozens of \\npeople it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied \\nfor amnesty. So the prosecutions should begin soon, right? Not so \\nfast. The study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela \\nbefore talk of new amnesty deals had begun. It seems that nearly all \\nof South Africa's political parties _ including the ruling African \\nNational Congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock \\nbecause of the report. Suddenly, there is lots of talk about how the \\ncountry can't withstand a round of politically divisive trials, and \\nmany political analysts here are betting that an agreement ``of mutual \\nbenefit'' is in the offing. Already, three major political parties \\nare calling for some kind of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing \\nthe door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was ``premature'' to \\ntalk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was \\ndiscussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South \\nAfricans against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province \\nwith bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s. In choosing a \\ntruth commission rather than a Nuremberg-style trial with which to \\nclose out its brutal past, South Africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation. \\nPeople would come clean and receive true forgiveness. Society would \\nthen be able to move on, its wounds cleansed and healed. It was a \\nmodel watched closely around the world by other societies wondering \\nhow to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past. But \\ngiven the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators did not \\ncome forward. Commission officials themselves say they were frustrated \\nby the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. \\nIt is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today's South \\nAfrica has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment, crime, \\nwhite flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind up settling \\nfor a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives amnesty to the \\nunrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concerned to \\nmove on. In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity \\nin many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South \\nAfrica's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and \\nto subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test. Certainly \\nthe commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its \\npast, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers told of smashed \\ngenitals and near suffocations. And the commission's work added much \\nto the knowledge about what happened in South Africa between 1960 \\nand 1994. But it will be years before the effect of the commission \\ncan truly be judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will \\nvendettas persist? No one can answer. One thing seems clear, however: \\nFour years after South Africa held its first non-racial elections, \\na growing number of South Africans want to be done with the past. \\nRaymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter, Southern \\nAfrica Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up during the \\nFebruary session of Parliament, in time to remove the issue from next \\nyear's election campaigns. ``You simply can't have this country torn \\napart by prosecutions,'' he says. ``Everybody is going to be howling \\nfor an amnesty. They already are.'' Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, \\nthe commission's chairman, delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating \\na push for a new amnesty and arguing against it. He said such a move \\nwould be highly unfair to those who came forward. He suggested instead \\nthat there be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted \\nwould in effect get amnesty. To be sure, there will be opposition \\nto any proposals to limit prosecutions. More than a dozen human rights \\nand victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn \\nsuch proposals as ``unconscionable.'' The idea for a Truth Commission \\nemerged as a compromise from the long negotiations that brought about \\nSouth Africa's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state \\nto a non-racial democracy. During the talks, the white National Party \\ngovernment pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused. In the \\nend, only about 250 former police officers came forward, most of them \\nfoot soldiers. And only two high National Party officials, former \\nLaw and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan \\nvan der Merwe, confessed _ to roles in ordering bombings. In its report, \\nthe commission called the apartheid state the ``primary perpetrator'' \\nof gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former \\nofficials as former President P.W. Botha, his former army chief, Georg \\nMeiring, and the former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. \\nThese men, and others of lower rank, have not applied for amnesty \\nFor the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible prosecution \\nof Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who is accused \\nin the report of taking part in a number of assaults and abductions. \\nLesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC is held responsible \\nfor at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems are further \\ncomplicated by its efforts to make peace with the largely Zulu-based \\nInkatha Freedom Party. Virtually no one from that party came forward \\nto ask for amnesty. Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with \\nthe white government, was responsible for widespread slaughter in \\nKwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg. Inkatha's \\nleader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand \\naccused of fomenting a wide range of abuses. But prosecuting Chief \\nButhelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu. Part of the reluctance \\nto go forward with prosecutions may be the result of still another \\nfactor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime \\nand the evidence from the apartheid era is old. So why spend the time \\nand the money? At the moment, only one political party is opposed \\nto any form of new amnesty _ the tiny but influential Democratic Party, \\na liberal group that was not involved in the violence. Its head, Tony \\nLeon, says a new amnesty would only prove that ``the more thuglike \\nyour behavior, the more you get away with.'' But he concedes that \\nhis is a lonely voice. ``At this point,'' he says, ``there is little \\nenthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past.'' \\n\\nA panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will \\nnot implicate the last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human \\nrights abuses after he threatened a court challenge. De Klerk said \\nhe would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and \\nReconciliation Commission, which was due for release Thursday. The \\nman who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a finding \\nby the commission that he was ``an accessory after the fact'' to bombings \\nin the 1980s of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor \\nfederation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, \\nsaid the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, \\nand would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying \\nits release. ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously \\nfair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been \\nengaged in a vendetta against him. ``But we must and will respect \\nthe courts and his rights under the constitution. We fought hard for \\nthose rights and we can be proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk \\nnow shares in them,'' he said in a statement. ``All we are doing is \\npostponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu later told The Associated \\nPress. ``The name will eventually appear after all the hoo-ha has \\ndied down.'' De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment \\nbefore speaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts. \\nThe commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by laying \\nbare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around the country \\nfor more than two years, listening to victims and perpetrators seeking \\namnesty. The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone \\nfor South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. \\nDe Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism prompted \\nby leaks of the report. The African National Congress, the liberation \\nmovement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs the country, on \\nTuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too was guilty of human \\nrights violations in its armed struggle. The report will be a broad \\nand detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from \\n1960 to 1994, when all-race elections ended white minority rule. It \\nwill parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. \\nOther threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals being \\nnamed as rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported \\nWednesday. In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more \\nthan 400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give \\nthem a chance to respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out \\nof the report, he said. \\n\\nPresident Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National \\nCongress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds \\nwith his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South \\nAfrica. The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report \\nby the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during \\napartheid. Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation, \\nthe report has caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms \\nwho fought apartheid. As expected, the report called apartheid a ``crime \\nagainst humanity.'' But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rights \\nviolations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group tortured \\nsuspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent civilians with \\nland mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors were killed in the ANC's \\ncamps abroad. Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will \\nlikely be elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela \\nretires _ took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated \\nall ANC members must do the same. ``No member, 5th graf, 1st Ld-Writethru \\n\\nCriminal prosecutions for atrocities committed during the war against \\nwhite rule could drag on for at least six years, a top prosecutor \\nsaid Monday. Key figures implicated in human rights abuses by the \\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, \\nthe official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters. They include two unnamed \\ngenerals in the apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson \\nMandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials of the African \\nNational Congress, he said. The remarks by d'Oliveira, who recently \\nwas appointed a deputy national director of prosecutions, were the \\nclearest signal yet that criminal cases would be brought against figures \\naccused by the commission of gross human rights violations. The commission \\nreleased its report Oct. 30. It chronicles the human rights abuses \\ncommitted by apartheid governments and their operatives as well as \\nby the African National Congress and others fighting the racist system. \\nThe issue of continuing prosecutions is significant. Many feel that \\ndragging on criminal reckonings of the horrors of the apartheid era \\nwill only prolong bitterness and delay reconciliation. But supporters \\nof prosecution feel that denying justice to the victims is a worse \\nevil. On a practical level, highly public prosecutions of ANC figures \\ncould have an impact on national elections next year, when the party \\nwill seek to consolidate its hold on power. The panel's chairman, \\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu, has called for a two-year time limit on prosecutions; \\nd'Oliveira called the period ``wholly impractical.'' The prosecutor \\ndid not name the other targets. ``We have always worked on the principle \\nof that we will prosecute the highest rank,'' he said. The commission \\nhas the ability to grant amnesty to those who admit their misdeeds \\nand are found to have acted with political motives. The report said \\nindividuals who have not sought amnesty should be prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela \\nhas not sought amnesty. The commission found her accountable for human \\nrights violations committed by her bodyguards, who the report said \\nkilled and tortured suspected opponents. Madikizela-Mandela was convicted \\nin 1991 of kidnapping and being an accessory to an assault on four \\nyoung men. She was sentenced to six years in jail, but paid a dlrs \\n3,200 fine on appeal. The ANC official was among the most prominent \\nanti-apartheid activists. The two generals were implicated during \\nTruth Commission testimony. Prosecutors are ready to move forward \\npending the amnesty application of one. \\n\\nFacing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission \\nsaid Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts \\nof its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era \\npresident, F.W. de Klerk, in illegal acts. De Klerk, 62, who helped \\nnegotiate the end of South Africa's white supremacist government and \\nshared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with President Nelson Mandela for \\nthat work, had objected to a finding by the commission that he was \\n``an accessory after the fact'' in the bombings of the headquarters \\nof a church group and of a labor federation in the 1980s. The chairman \\nof the 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said that although \\nhe took such action with ``great reluctance,'' the commission needed \\ntime to prepare to fight the legal challenge. He said it would take \\nde Klerk's name out of 3,500-page report to avoid delaying its release \\nThursday. ``It upsets me deeply,'' he said in a statement. ``We have \\nbeen scrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that \\nwe have been engaged in a vendetta against him.'' De Klerk's challenge \\nwas only part of the storm of criticism prompted by leaks about the \\nreport in the last few days. Within hours of the commission decision \\nto withdraw its findings on de Klerk, it was facing the possibility \\nof a new suit _ this time from the ruling African National Congress. \\nThe ANC also wants to block the commission findings about its conduct \\nduring the liberation struggle. A spokesman for the party, Thabo Masebe, \\nsaid the party would seek an injunction in the morning before the \\nreport is officially handed over to Mandela. While the commission's \\nreport is expected to lay overwhelming blame on the former white government \\nfor atrocities, it has also found the ANC responsible for human-rights \\nviolations, including the torture and killing of spying suspects, \\nbombings in civilian areas and the killing of political enemies, including \\nmembers of the rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision \\non de Klerk seems certain to damage the commission's credibility. \\nThe panel, created as a way of putting South Africa's brutal past \\nto rest without the expense and political divisiveness of trials, \\nhas caused controversy from the start. It has held more than 160 hearings \\nthroughout the country, listening to both victims and to perpetrators \\nseeking amnesty. But many whites say the commission is on a witch \\nhunt aiming to humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners \\nin general. De Klerk has once before forced the commission officials \\nto court and won an apology from them for calling him a liar. Some \\npolitical analysts said Wednesday's events would only further the \\nbelief that the panel lacks impartiality. ``The withdrawal of the \\nfindings can't help but be seen as a lack of certainty on their side,'' \\nsaid Sampie Terreblanche, an economist and political analyst at the \\nUniversity of Stellenbosch, who has supported the commission. ``Whether \\nwe like it or not, the whole report gets a knock from this.'' De Klerk's \\nspokesman, David Steward, said the former president ``was very confident'' \\nthat he would win when the case goes to trial in March. ``He is very \\nhappy to be in the courts now rather than dealing with the Truth Commission,'' \\nSteward said. ``The fact that they agreed to withdraw creates the \\ndefinite impression that they specifically concocted a case to involve \\nMr. de Klerk in a negative finding.'' The ANC has accused the commission \\nof trying to ``criminalize'' the liberation struggle. ``Whatever the \\nefforts to besmirch our struggle by denouncing it as a gross violation \\nof human rights,'' the congress said in a statement. ``The ANC and \\nthe millions of people who were part of this struggle will always \\nbe proud of what they did to insure that, in the process of the destruction \\nof a vile system, they did not themselves resort to vile methods of \\nstruggle on the basis that the means justified the end.'' There are \\nprobably few subjects that get South Africans more excited than the \\nissue of the Truth Commission and whether it is a worthy cause or \\na waste of money. The events of the last few days have only added \\nto the debate. For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of \\nthe ANC's armed wing, the fact all sides of the political spectrum \\nare in an uproar is a good thing. ``The mere fact that everyone is \\ncomplaining means that the Truth Commission has done its work,'' he \\nsaid. But others say that too many questions are being raised about \\nthe panel's competence. ``The whole affair is beyond the pale, a mockery \\nof justice,'' said Roboy Vonholdt, a 56-year-old sheep and ostrich \\nfarmer who believes that the commission has been a theatrical act. \\n``We should all turn our backs on the past and move forward. We need \\nthem and they need us. Let's all make money and let good economic \\nconditions prevail.'' The commission's report is supposed to be a \\nbroad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, \\nfrom 1960 to 1994, when elections open to all races ended white minority \\nrule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual \\nprosecutions. While de Klerk was alone in court Wednesday challenging \\nthe commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal challenges \\nhad led to fewer individuals being named as rights violators than \\noriginally planned. Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified \\nthat they would be implicated to give them a chance to respond. Some \\n15 successfully argued themselves out of the report or could not be \\nreached and were therefore deleted from the report, he said. The commission \\nis required by law to give advance notification to anyone it intends \\nto implicate in its report. The commission had been expected to say \\nthat although de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently \\ncame to know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police \\nCommissioner Johan van der Merwe had been involved, but failed to \\nreport his knowledge to the police. This could open him up to a criminal \\nprosecution. De Klerk has not applied for amnesty in this matter or \\nany other. de Klerk has said that when he learned about the bombings, \\nVlok and Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying for \\namnesty, and he did not think it was necessary to report the matter. \\n\\nA panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National \\nCongress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, \\nthe state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, which led the struggle \\nagainst white rule and now is in power, previously has acknowledged \\nit was told to expect implication in right violations. The Truth and \\nReconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years \\nof investigation on Thursday. The report was expected to place overwhelming \\nblame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security \\nservices. President Nelson Mandela's office received an advance copy \\non Monday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop \\nDesmond Tutu, who chaired the comission, will present Mandela with \\nthe report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been \\nleaked a ``preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically \\nand morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and \\nafter the fall of apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said \\nhe believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in \\nadvance ``informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross \\nhuman rights violations.'' Commission officials could not immediately \\nbe reached for comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists \\nin Pretoria he had heard the news report, but would not comment. Former \\nPresident F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans to ask a court to prevent \\nthe Truth Commission report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored \\nterror. ``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar \\nsaid, but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay. The ANC \\nwas nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners \\nearlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed. \\nThe party says the accusations against it likely would center on the \\nplanting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military camps \\nin Angola and bombings. Omar said he expected the report's conclusions \\nto set off debate but added it would ``lay the basis for reconciliation.'' \\n\\nFollowing are excerpts from the final report issued by South Africa's \\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On \\nthe basis of the evidence available to it, the primary finding of \\nthe Commission is that: The predominant portion of gross violations \\nof human rights was committed by the former state through its security \\nand law-enforcement agencies. Moreover, the South African state in \\nthe period from the late 1970's to early 1990's became involved in \\nactivities of a criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly \\nplanned, undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful \\nacts, including the extrajudicial killing of political opponents and \\nothers, inside and outside South Africa. In pursuit of these unlawful \\nactivities, the state acted in collusion with certain other political \\ngroupings, most notably the Inkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.). . . . \\nCertain members of the State Security Council (the state President, \\nMinister of Defense, Minister of Law and Order, and heads of security \\nforces) did foresee that the use of words such as ``take out,'' ``wipe \\nout,'' ``eradicate,'' and ``eliminate'' would result in the killing \\nof political opponents. They are therefore responsible for deliberate \\nplanning which caused gross violations of human rights. P.W. BOTHA \\nDuring the period that he presided as head of state (1978-1989) according \\nto submissions made to and findings made by the Commission, gross \\nviolations of human rights and other unlawful acts were perpetrated \\non a wide scale by members of the South African Defense Force, including: \\nThe deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing of persons opposed \\nto the policies of the Government, within and outside South Africa. \\nThe widespread use of torture and other forms of severe ill treatment \\nagainst such persons. The forcible abduction of such persons where \\nwere resident in neighboring countries. Covert logistical and financial \\nassistance to organizations opposed to the ideology of the A.N.C. \\nand other liberation movements. . . . INKATHA The Commission finds \\nthat in 1986, the South African Defense Forces (S.A.D.F.) conspired \\nwith Inkatha to provide the latter with a covert, offensive paramilitary \\nunit (or ``hit squad'') to be deployed illegally against persons and \\norganizations perceived to be opposed to both the South African Government \\nand Inkatha. The S.A.D.F. provided training, financial and logistical \\nmanagement and behind the scenes supervision of the trainees, who \\nwere trained by the Special Forces unit of the S.A.D.F. in the Caprivi \\nStrip. The Commission finds furthermore that the deployment of the \\nparamilitary unit in KwaZulu led to gross violations of human rights, \\nincluding killing, attempted killing and severe ill treatment. The \\nCommission finds the following people, among others, accountable for \\nsuch violations: Mr. P. W. Botha, Gen. Magnus Malan, Chief Mangosuthu \\nButhelezi. . . . The A.N.C. While it was A.N.C. policy that the loss \\nof civilian life should be ``avoided,'' there were instances where \\nmembers of its security forces perpetrated gross violations of human \\nrights in that the distinction between military and civilian targets \\nwas blurred in certain armed actions, such as the 1983 Church Street \\nbombing of the South African Air Force headquarters. . . . In the \\ncourse of the armed struggle, the A.N.C., through its security forces, \\nundertook military operations which, though intended for military \\nor security force targets, sometimes went awry for a variety of reasons, \\nincluding poor intelligence and reconnaissance. The consequences in \\nthese cases, such as the Magoo's Bar and Durban Esplanade bombings, \\nwere gross violations of human rights in respect of the injuries to \\nand loss of lives of civilians. Individuals who defected to the state \\nand became informers and/or members who became state witnesses in \\npolitical trials . . . were often labeled by the A.N.C. as collaborators \\nand regarded as legitimate targets to be killed. The commission does \\nnot condone the legitimization of such individuals as military targets \\nand finds that the extrajudicial killings of such individuals constituted \\ngross violations of human rights. The commission finds that, in the \\n1980's in particular, a number of gross violations were perpetrated \\nnot by direct members of the A.N.C. or those operating under its formal \\ncommand, but by civilians who saw themselves as A.N.C. supporters. \\nIn this regard, the Commission finds that the A.N.C. is morally and \\npolitically accountable for creating a climate in which such supporters \\nbelieved their actions to be legitimate and carried out within the \\nbroad parameters of a ``people's war'' as enunciated by the A.N.C. \\nA.N.C. CAMPS The Commission finds that suspected ``agents'' were routinely \\nsubjected to torture and other forms of severe ill treatment and that \\nthere were cases of such individuals being charged and convicted by \\ntribunals without proper regard to due process, sentenced to death \\nand executed. WINNIE MADIKIZELA-MANDELA The Commission finds that \\nMs. Madikizela-Mandela was central to the establishment and formation \\nof the Mandela United Football Club, which later developed into a \\nprivate vigilante unit. It is the Commission's view that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela \\nwas aware of the criminal activity and the disquiet it caused in the \\ncommunity, but chose deliberately not to address the problems emanating \\nfrom the football club. The Commission finds that those who opposed \\nMs. Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, or dissented \\nfrom them, were branded as informers and killed. The Commission finds \\nthat Ms. Madikizela-Mandela . . . is accountable, politically and \\nmorally for the gross violations of human rights committed by the \\nMandela United Football Club. The Commission finds further that Mrs. \\nMadikizela-Mandela herself was responsible for committing such gross \\nviolations of human rights. . . . BUSINESS Business was central to \\nthe economy that sustained the South African state during the apartheid \\nyears. Certain businesses, especially the mining industry, were involved \\nin helping design and implement apartheid policies. The white agriculture \\nindustry benefited from its privileged access to land. \\n\", \"\\nHours after Darryl Strawberry was released from Columbia Presbyterian \\nMedical Center Friday, he spoke happily about being able to play with \\nhis two young children, joked about eating a small amount of chicken \\nand potatoes and sounded relieved to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., \\ninstead of in a hospital. ``I'm really feeling good,'' said Strawberry, \\nin a telephone interview. ``It's nice to be home with the kids and \\nto just kick back. That's all that I'm going to do. This feels good.'' \\nStrawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his colon \\non Oct. 3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 \\ndays before returning home to Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old \\noutfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound \\nframe, said he does not have enough strength to attend any of the \\nWorld Series games and is content watching his teammates play the \\nPadres on television. ``My heart is with them,'' said Strawberry, \\nwho spoke to several Yankees after they won the American League championship. \\n``I'm just going to relax at home and watch the game. I'm looking \\nforward to it. I may not be there, but it'll feel like I am.'' Paul \\nO'Neill echoed the sentiments of many Yankees by saying, ``Everything \\nwe're going through is game. This is his life. Any time we get some \\ngood news about Darryl it's uplifting. We're all praying for him.'' \\nSince cancerous cells were found in one of the 36 lymph nodes removed \\nfrom his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry said doctors told \\nhim he will need six months of chemotherapy treatment once he returns \\nto California. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctors told him he \\nwill need one treatment of at least one hour a week. ``I was never \\nscared,'' said Strawberry. ``I was more emotional than anything. At \\nthe time of it, I had played for a while with this. I wanted to keep \\nplaying because I knew we were going to get into the World Series.'' \\nAt that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because the \\nYankees had made it to the World Series as he expected. ``I wanted \\nto be there because that's what you play for,'' said Strawberry. ``I \\ndon't think that I was ever scared. It's something that I wanted to \\ndeal with head on. I talked to Eric Davis about the chemo. He said \\nit's not as bad as some people say.'' Although the discovery of cancer \\nin one lymph node proved that the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained \\noptimistic about his future and said, ``It didn't worry me. I got \\nall the information from the doctors. One out of 36 is good. It wasn't \\nspreading. It didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can.'' When \\nStrawberry was released from the hospital in a wheelchair Friday, \\na few hundred fans who had congregated chanted, ``Darryl, Darryl.'' \\nStrawberry, who struggled not to cry, hugged a few nurses, thanked \\neveryone for supporting him, then rose from the wheelchair and carefully \\nentered a car. ``Wow, I never thought this day would come,'' Strawberry \\nsaid. ``But it has.'' Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter \\nin the World Series who predicted the Yankees would throttle the Padres \\nin five games, Strawberry refused to make a prediction about whether \\nhe will soon be getting his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, \\nwho is still hopeful about returning to play in 1999, sounded very \\nconfident in the 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 on the \\nback of their caps as inspiration. ``They look really good,'' said \\nStrawberry.'' It's not going to be easy, but I think they're ready. \\nThe best thing about making it to the World Series is you know you \\ndon't have to go anywhere else after that. You've made it to that \\npoint and then you go do the best you can do. That's what it's all \\nabout.'' \\n\\nA new shipment of bats arrived for Tino Martinez on Friday, and he \\nmassaged the handles to make sure they were thin enough, knocked on \\nthe barrels and listened for a certain sound and swung them slowly \\nagain and again. Martinez was so excited about the fresh bats, he \\nreacted like a Little Leaguer who was wielding an aluminum bat for \\nthe first time. ``You were saving the World Series trees until now, \\nright?'' Martinez said to the representative from the bat company. \\n``These are from World Series trees, aren't they?'' Martinez could \\njoke about the bats being specially designed for the World Series \\nbecause the Yankees began their quest for a second title in the past \\nthree years when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 \\nat Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players who were watching \\non television could not imitate David Letterman and joke about World \\nSeries wood. Even though Martinez has struggled with numerous bats \\nduring the post-season, he could joke because the Yankees are still \\nalive for the title. Martinez is still alive. For now, Martinez, the \\npower hitter who has mostly been missing in action, could joke around. \\nFor now. ``You always get a fresh start in the post-season because \\nit's game to game,'' said Martinez. ``If you win, you've got another \\ngame the next day so you forget about the bad at-bats. It's easier \\nto do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the biggest \\nat-bat of the season.'' Normally, having Martinez at the plate for \\nthe biggest at-bat of the season would be a pleasing sight to the \\nYankees. But not when the calendar flips to October. Martinez has \\nexperienced another frustrating post-season. He is 5 for 30 with 10 \\nstrikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted in for a hitting-starved \\nteam that has batted .229 while still winning 7 of 9 post-season games \\nbecause of superior pitching. Can the Yankees continue to win if Martinez, \\ntheir most valuable run producer, is a sometime singles hitter? ``We've \\njust gotten through two good series,'' said Paul O'Neill. ``The Yankees \\nwon those series. You don't focus on one guy. You focus on winning. \\nThe whole team won.'' As much as Joe Torre talked about Martinez needing \\none line-drive hit to get him in a groove, the 30-year-old first baseman \\nis in a career drought in the post-season. Since joining the Yankees, \\nMartinez is 20 for 107 (.187) with one homer and 4 RBI in 29 post-season \\ngames. Those are puny statistics, especially for a player who has \\ndriven in 381 runs in 455 regular season games over the last three \\nyears. ``I would guess that Tino would have a great series,'' O'Neill \\nsaid. ``Baseball has a way of evening things out. You have a bad series, \\nyou come back and have a great series. In the season, that's easier \\nto do. In the post-season, it gets tougher.'' It cannot get much tougher \\nfor Martinez, who was dropped from fifth to sixth in the order during \\nthe American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians \\nand will remain in that spot until further notice. Martinez has blamed \\nhis paucity of production on impatience and on trying to do too much. \\nHe has sometimes flailed at poor pitches during hitter's counts of \\n3-1 and 2-0, instead of working the count, and he has admitted that \\nhis previous failures in the post-season have caused him to pursue \\nthe obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez has \\nalready made some alterations, and he has reached base 7 times in \\nhis last 10 plates appearances on a double, a single, a hit-by-pitch \\nand 4 walks. It is not enough to pacify George Steinbrenner, but it \\nis something for him to cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez \\nhad to face Kevin Brown, a nasty right-hander who had retired him \\nin 30 of 34 career at-bats. ``If I was getting good pitches and missing \\nthem, then I'd say I have a bad swing working,'' said Martinez. ``But \\nI've been swinging at bad pitches. Right now, I've just got to be \\npatient and wait.'' The Yankees will wait with him. They have to. \\nIn the 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder over Martinez \\nat first in Games 3, 4 and 5. It was a difficult decision because \\nMartinez had paced the team in RBI while Fielder did not join the \\nYankees until July 31. But the Yankees grabbed all three games so \\nit worked. Torre does not have such an attractive replacement this \\nseason in Luis Sojo. So the Yankees will stay with Martinez, for better \\nor worse, while he tries to stay positive and finally produce. ``It's \\nthe World Series,'' said Martinez. ``You got to go out there and have \\nfun with it. Big games are all big games. You want to go out there \\nand enjoy that game and try to do your best to win that game. You \\ndon't think that you might lose that day.'' \\n\\nA strong sign that this city is going bonkers for the Padres came \\nFriday morning when 680 fans agreed to shave their heads for a radio \\npromotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance at skybox tickets \\nfor post-season play. ``This was more a show of support for the team \\nthan it was for the one ticket,'' said Tommy Sablan, producer of the \\n``Jeff and Jer'' show. ``It was symbolic of the efforts of the bald \\nPadres _ Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About \\na thousand people showed up _ men, women and children. We had 10 barbers \\nand 20 hairdressers and it took six hours for the lines to either \\nget buzzed or straight-razored. ``We were shocked at the turnout. \\nBut this is a bandwagon town. `Buy the ticket on the day of the concert' \\ntype public. You'll see an even bigger bandwagon on Monday when they've \\nwon and then hopefully we play the Yankees and it's a real World Series.'' \\nAfter the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National League \\nChampionship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a two-game \\nlead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing \\nup for a shot at the World Series in more traditional ways. It would \\nbe the team's first World Series appearance since 1984, and in the \\ndowntown business district Friday, marquees and banners read ``Go \\nPadres'' and a lunch-hour rally was attended by several hundred fans. \\nThe Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up a \\nhalf-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from three \\nyears ago. It stemmed in part from an effort by John Moores, the Padres \\nowner, and Larry Lucchino, the team's president, to put family entertainment \\nin the park after they bought the team in December 1994. ``This is \\na more diversified group of fans than I saw in Atlanta,'' Lucchino \\nsaid. ``Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud of our three generations \\nof families who come to the games.'' Donna McMahon, a 63-year-old \\nhomemaker from La Jolla, has been a fan since she was 10 and the Pacific \\nCoast League Padres played at Lane Field near the harbor. She would \\ntake a streetcar after school to meet her father, and he would buy \\nbleacher seats. Later, she brought her four children to Jack Murphy \\nStadium for the National League Padres when 2,500 people was a crowd. \\nNow, she brings her grandchildren to a sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. \\n``There are different groups in the stands,'' she said, ``the upper \\nclass, the middle class, the business person, the beer-drinking fan, \\nthe children, all of the Mexican fans from across the border. We are \\ntrue fans _ all of us.'' San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while \\nalso giving credit to the balmy weather. ``Padre fans are a cross-section \\nfrom all over the county,'' she said. ``Downtown, suburban, rural, \\neast, north, ranchers and farmers to high-tech engineers, yuppies \\nto the new kids _ the X generation. A lot from across the border. \\nThe Padres are extremely popular in Tijuana. We do have the perfect \\nweather for a long baseball season. Playing in the World Series in \\nOctober has got to be better than in New York.'' Carlos Carrion, who \\nwas born in San Diego and has been a baseball fan for 25 years, brings \\nhis 10- and 8-year-old sons to the stadium. ``This is a great chance \\nto let my children see the players work,'' Carrion said. ``They can \\nlook up to these guys and understand their character and their work \\nethic.'' The Padres ticket office estimates that on average, more \\nthan 15,000 fans in the 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans from \\nSan Diego, Baja California or the state of Sonora. The Padres have \\nthe first major league baseball souvenir store in Tijuana. \\n\\nChuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were as popular as squeegee men \\na week ago, the speculation rampant that one or the other or both \\nmight be exiled if the Yankees' historic year crumbled in the post-season. \\nTwo big hits in the midst of a big inning changed all that Saturday \\nnight in Game 1 of the World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, \\n5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run \\nto tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed a grand \\nslam. The seven-run explosion rocketed the Yankees to a 9-6 victory \\nin the opener of the four-of-seven-game series, before 56,712 at Yankee \\nStadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Andy Ashby in Game 2 \\nSunday night at the Stadium. Beyond seizing the advantage in the series, \\nthe Yankees were able to neutralize the Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, \\ndriving him from the mound in the seventh. Brown, seen by many as \\nSan Diego's best hope for a World Series upset, will not pitch again \\nuntil Game 4, at the earliest. Brown was pitching with a three-run \\nlead after the top of the fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn banged \\nback-to-back homers. One out into the seventh, however, Jorge Posada \\nhit a single, and Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, who had thrown \\na whopping 64 pitches in the first three innings, went out, and the \\nreliever Donne Wall came in to face Knoblauch. This is what the Yankees \\nhave done all season, force a starter from the game in the middle \\ninnings, before exploiting a middle reliever. Knoblauch, of course, \\nhad earned notoriety for his gaffe in the Game 2 of the American League \\nChampionship Series against Cleveland, standing and waiting for an \\ninterference call as the ball rolled to a stop behind him and the \\ndecisive run scored. The Yankees came back to win the series, however; \\nKnoblauch got a reprieve and talked about how much the experience \\nhad helped him. Facing Wall with a one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch \\nhad to duck under a runaway fastball. Two balls, no strikes. Wall \\nhad to throw a strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lifted a high fly \\ndown the left-field line. Off the bat, it did not look like much. \\nBut it kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back in left and looking up, \\nto see the ball disappear into the stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium \\nshook. Knoblauch rounded the bases, crossed home plate and thrust \\nboth arms into the air, yelling to the crowd, like a hyped Olympic \\nweightlifter who had just successfully hoisted a half-ton. He stomped \\naround the dugout, his helmet on, teammates banging on him happily. \\nWhen Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left the game, \\nand Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and after Jeter \\nadvanced on a wild pitch, Bernie Williams was intentionally walked. \\nChili Davis drew a walk. Bases loaded, once more, with Martinez coming \\nto the plate, with exactly one run batted in in his first 76 career \\nat-bats in league championship and World Series games. With the count \\ntwo balls and two strikes, Langston threw a pitch near the outside \\ncorner that he thought should have been a strike. Instead, Garcia \\ncalled it a ball. Langston glared, snapping at the return throw. Langston \\nand Martinez and everyone on the field now understood that with the \\nbases loaded and a 3-2 count, Langston would have to throw what players \\nrefer to as a cookie _ a tasty pitch over the middle. Martinez ate \\nup this cookie. The ball soared into the upper deck in right field, \\nlifting three years of post-season misery off the back of the Yankees' \\nfirst baseman, a grand slam. The crowd called out Martinez from the \\ndugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped both arms, and later \\nthe crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San \\nDiego's lead was long gone. The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead over \\nBrown in the second inning, forcing him to throw 32 pitches in the \\nsecond. They loaded the bases with a single and two walks, and Ledee, \\nthe rookie left fielder who is playing because none of Torre's left \\nfielders have been hitting, pulled a sinking fastball down the right \\nfield line with two outs. The fans along the foul line stood, some \\nwaving to push the ball fair with the body English, and the ball landed \\non the line, skipping off the wall as two runners scored. The Yankees \\nhad the early edge, they had jumped on Brown, and they had their best \\npitcher on the mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led off the second inning \\nwith a blooper over shortstop, the ball falling in for a single. Quilvio \\nVeras flied to right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing \\nVaughn to the plate. David Wells got ahead in the count, no balls \\nand two strikes, with a change-up and a fastball, before trying to \\nrun a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs during the regular \\nseason. Vaughn attacked the pitch: a line drive that landed in the \\nsecond deck, foul all the way, but a frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, \\nthe Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound to re-think the strategy, \\nperhaps to remind Wells of the conventional wisdom: you must pitch \\nVaughn on the outer edge of the plate. Posada returned to the plate, \\ncalled for an outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing was short \\nand quick, the ball making a click sound off the bat, like a well-struck \\ngolf ball, before carrying over the wall in right-center field. Tie \\ngame. Wells retired the first two batters in the fifth inning, before \\njamming Veras with an inside fastball. Veras' bat snapped on contact, \\nbut it was enough to send a looper into short center field, a single. \\nGwynn stepped in, having hit a single in his first two at-bats, and \\nlooked for a sign from the third base coach Tim Flannery. With a runner \\non first, he likes to try to pull a ball through the right side of \\nthe infield. Wells fired a fastball, Gwynn turned on the pitch and \\nripped it, a line drive that crashed off the facing of the upper deck \\nin right field. The Padres jumped from the dugout, celebrating, as \\nWells turned away, disgusted, asking for a new baseball. He got one, \\ndelivered another fastball, and Vaughn slugged this deep into the \\nleft field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, the first back-to-back \\nhome runs allowed by Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and \\nYankee Stadium was silent. It would not stay that way. \\n\\nThe New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It is \\nfitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude \\nwith a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the \\naging but still grand cathedral of the sport. Bedecked in bunting \\nand banners, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with its \\naura of history and accomplishment. That makes it the perfect venue \\nfor part of a championship series that will determine whether the \\n1998 Yankees are one of the greatest teams of the modern era, or just \\na talented squad that owned the regular season but folded in the World \\nSeries. New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter \\nof the city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem \\nto anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres. The \\nword on the sidewalks and in the subways is that the Padres don't \\nmeasure up against the Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting pitchers \\nin Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best closers \\nin Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn \\nand Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling but still dangerous. But how is that \\na match for the Yankees' World Series starting rotation of David Wells, \\nOrlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower \\nMariano Rivera, plus the deepest batting order in baseball? Yet the \\ntruth is that Yankees fans are terrified the team will crumple. Baseball \\nfans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime waiting to see a home \\nteam of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that \\nsanctified status unless it ends its record-setting season by winning \\nthe World Series. The doubts keep creeping up. The team was pitiful \\nat the plate through most of the playoffs. Tino Martinez, the top \\nrun producer, has been in a numbing slump. Bernie Williams, the American \\nLeague batting champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland \\nIndians, but has seemed distracted by personal matters. Shane Spencer, \\nthe rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned out to be \\nthe new Mr. October. Pettitte has been struggling since August. The \\ncurious thing about this team, which won more games during the regular \\nseason than any team in American League history, is how quiet and \\nunobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering \\nclubhouse leader, no one who seems to belong in New York. So when \\nthe Yankees start to drift on the field, fans tend to fear the team \\nmight simply fade away. Until the Indians surged temporarily ahead \\nin the playoffs, the Yankees had faced no serious test of resiliency \\nall season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade \\nup Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer at the stadium Saturday \\nnight will lurk the fear that when the curtain falls on the season, \\nan unheralded and unlegendary team from San Diego will be the one \\nthat is remembered. \\n\\nYANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance \\npast Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. David Wells \\nis 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional \\nedge against a Padres' lineup that is generally less effective against \\nleft-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches, \\npitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and \\nearned the start in Game 2 of this series. David Cone should benefit \\nfrom six days' worth of rest when he starts Game 3, as well as being \\nable to pitch in warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff \\nmight be as good as it has been all year, and Mike Stanton continues \\nto be a dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons for concern: the erratic \\nAndy Pettitte, who needs a home-plate umpire to call strikes on pitches \\nlow and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lost his command in his last brief \\nouting. Offense There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming \\nout of its collective slump _ Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently, \\nDerek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through \\nthe middle, Bernie Williams had three hits in Game 6, and Scott Brosius \\nhas been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup. But the Yankees \\ndo have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed to catch up to the \\nfastballs of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason \\nfunk is a problem. The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge \\nPosada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive \\npitches low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power. Defense \\nThe Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the middle \\nwith Jeter and Knoblauch, and at third with Brosius. Nobody's really \\ntaken advantage of the fact that Williams has a poor arm in center \\nfield, but rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn \\nwill try. The Indians did expose the fact that the Yankees' pitchers \\nhave trouble preventing baserunners from stealing from second to third \\nbase. Baserunning The Yankees run well as they take extra bases, particularly \\nPaul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams \\ncan make mistakes. The Yankees probably won't be able to steal against \\nKevin Brown, who has an effective slide step, but they could be aggressive \\nagainst Andy Ashby, or the combination of Sterling Hitchcock and Jim \\nLeyritz. PADRES Hitting Except for Jim Leyritz, no one in the San \\nDiego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening at the \\nmoment. Tony Gwynn hasn't been as consistent as he usually is, Ken \\nCaminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky. But the Padres are a veteran \\nteam capable of putting the ball in play, getting runners on base \\nand then moving them along, and so long as they are getting exceptional \\npitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, the leadoff \\nhitter, is adept at drawing walks and Steve Finley, who has become \\nmore pull conscious in the last two years, could try to take aim at \\nthe right field stands in Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be \\na factor if the Yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough to keep him \\nfrom leaning over the plate. Pitching Kevin Brown is the best pitcher \\nin this series, capable of winning three games if necessary, should \\nPadres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7. \\nBut at some point, San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy \\nAshby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting the \\ncorners with his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command \\nis suspect, he gets pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball \\nto great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two \\nrounds of the playoffs, but the Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause \\nhim some concern. San Diego's middle relief is the weakest aspect \\nof the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side \\n(the stuff of each has waned). But if a lead can be delivered into \\nthe hands of closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly \\ncatch the ball and avoid mistakes, though they are unspectacular. \\nShortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras are adept at turning \\ndouble plays, and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at third base last year; \\nWally Joyner has good hands at first; the center fielder Steve Finley \\nis extremely quick in tracking down base hits and returning the ball \\nto the infield. Tony Gwynn's range is better toward the right field \\nline, not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps. The Yankees will \\nbe able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field. Baserunning Veras \\ncan steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight spot, as \\nwell. In general, however, the Padres are a slow, plodding team, though \\nCaminiti and Vaughn are good at going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't \\nmake mistakes on the bases. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: \\nA switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch \\nhim down-and-in with breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, \\njam him with fastballs when he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: \\nA left-handed hitter who likes to pull the ball. Left-handers like \\nDavid Wells can beat him with breaking balls low and outside. Tony \\nGwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hitting well, \\nhe can be anxious early in the count, and he should be fed breaking \\nballs out of the strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power on anything \\nhigh and over the plate. Because he likes to pull the ball, you must \\npitch him on the outer edge, occasionally jamming him to keep him \\nhonest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, a better hitter left-handed. \\nThese days, he's a good lowball hitter and can be beat by fastballs \\nup in the zone. Wally Joyner: With runners on base, he'll try to jump \\non a fastball early in the count. Is not a strong hitter and can be \\njammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, likes to hit pitches inside \\nout, to right field and through the middle. He can hit with power \\nif you make a mistake with a breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient \\nhitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: \\nLooks for the first-pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike \\nzone. Can struggle against breaking balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent \\nholes right now, can hit fastballs in and away. Best bet is to get \\nahead in the count and try to get him to chase breaking balls. PITCHING \\nTO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers like to jam him with \\nfastballs because he stands on top of the plate, which is why he gets \\nhit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he has a tendency to chase pitches \\nat his feet, but if you don't get the ball in far enough, he can hammer \\nthe ball over the wall in right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure \\nhitter, he sometimes will chase fastballs up and away, particularly \\nafter there is one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who has \\ntrouble resisting chest-high fastballs. When he lays off them, he \\nis a much better hitter, and he did this in the last game of the Cleveland \\nseries. Chili Davis: Has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep \\ninto a count, but he can be overpowered with fastballs above his belt. \\nCheats some now to get his bat started, making him vulnerable to off-speed \\npitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right at the moment. Is anxious \\nand chases pitches out of the strike zone when he falls behind in \\nthe count, and isn't taking advantage of mistakes when they're made. \\nScott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, but he can also drive \\na fastball a long way when he anticipates, as Cleveland's Charles \\nNagy now knows. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, he fares very \\npoorly against splitters, curveballs and sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like \\nall young hitters, he has a tendency to expand the strike zone and \\nchase pitches out of the strike zone after falling behind in the count. \\nKevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS \\nKevin Brown: Best sinking fastball in the game (91-93) mph, a four-seam \\nfastball of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone, a slider that \\nbreaks down and away from right-handed batters, and a forkball that \\ndives at 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, \\naggressive, challenging hitters with fastballs. His curveball can \\nbe exceptional, and his changeup has improved. Throw strikes: Allowed \\nas many home runs (29) as walks (29), but has not allowed a three-run \\nhomer or a grand slam all year. \\n\\nThe last time they were seen on the field at Yankee Stadium, they \\nwere inadvertently influencing the outcome of the game that sent the \\nCleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the World Series. That's \\nnot to say the umpires will mess up in the World Series, but they \\nhave shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural \\nprogression of postseason games. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be \\nin the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement \\nwith the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship \\nseries and the World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even \\nthough the agreement does allow for an umpire to work both a division \\nseries and the World Series. The three American League umpires who \\nare on the six-man World Series crew did work in the first round of \\nthe playoffs. One of them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and \\nbehind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium. Gene \\nBudig, the AL president, Friday called Garcia, a 24-year veteran, \\none of the league's ``most respected umpires.'' But after Saturday \\nnight, Garcia will move to right field Sunday night for Game 2. Now \\nwhy does that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right \\nfield? Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked a post-season series at \\nYankee Stadium, he was the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship \\nseries two years ago when a young fan from New Jersey _ no name, please; \\nhe has been over-glorified enough _ reached over the fence and caught \\nDerek Jeter's fly ball just as Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, \\nprepared to catch it. Garcia ruled no interference, that it was a \\nhome run, then said oops after watching a television replay clearly \\nshowing interference. Too late. The call helped the Yankees win the \\nfirst game and set the tone for the series. ``Even though he made \\na mistake, you know you have the best out there,'' a baseball official, \\nspeaking on the condition of anonymity, said. That knowledge comes \\nas small consolation to the Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged that \\numpires, like players and managers, aren't perfect. ``Major league \\numpires are skilled at what they do, but they are human,'' he said \\nin a telephone interview. ``Day in and day out they do a very good \\njob for Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have been difficult, \\nbut that happens from time to time.'' The umpires were so human in \\nthe American League playoffs that it happened from time to time to \\ntime to time. The Cleveland Indians suffered the brunt of the fallibility \\nof the umpires. ``We had a highlight reel of umpires getting knocked \\ndown by baseballs,'' general manager John Hart said after the Indians' \\nfinal game against the Yankees. ``The umpires didn't lose the game \\nfor us, but we had our share of controversies in two playoff series \\nwith umpires.'' In the division series against Boston, Brinkman, the \\nplate umpire, was so bad with his calls on pitches and plays at the \\nplate that he immediately provoked disputes that led to his ejecting \\nof Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, three pitches into Game 2, \\nand Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry \\nwas right or wrong, depending on one's point of view, for his noncall \\nof interference on Travis Fryman in the 12th inning of Game 2 of the \\nALCS. That ruling went in favor of the Indians. Little else did. In \\nGame 4, Jeter was stealing second in the fifth inning when the on-target \\nthrow from Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jumped to try to get \\nout of the way but instead kicked the ball into right field. A batted \\nball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry in Game 6. But the \\nworst call of Game 6 was Hendry's on a force play at second base. \\nHendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that Vizquel's foot came \\noff the base before he caught the ball. Members of the Yankees indicated \\nFriday that they, too, thought the call was wrong. ``I don't know,'' \\nWilliams said when asked what he thought, ``but I'll take it. It was \\na big play.'' But did he think he was out? ``I'd rather not comment \\nabout that,'' he said. ``It will stir a lot of controversy. I don't \\nwant to get into that.'' When a player believes he was safe, he says \\nso and doesn't worry about any subsequent controversy. If Williams \\nwas implying that he thought he was out, another member of the Yankees \\nsaid he had no doubt that Williams was out. ``I wasn't sure at first,'' \\nthis uniformed member of the team said, ``but when I saw it was Hendry, \\nI said uh-oh. I also thought Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't \\ncome off the bag. Then I saw the replay. He was out.'' The game today \\nis faster than it used to be, this observer said. The umpires have \\nto be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the American \\nLeague, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from the \\nNational League, will be as sharp as an 18th century French guillotine \\nin these four to seven games. Leonard Coleman, the NL president, said \\nhe thought his umpires were first-rate in the division and league \\nseries and added that he has ``three splendid umpires'' working the \\nWorld Series. Budig said: ``The World Series crew is proven and first-rate. \\nWe have total confidence in them.'' The umpires should let the players \\nmake the errors and the managers the bad decisions. Then everyone \\nwill talk about the players and managers and not the umpires. \\n\\nAs Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the \\nYankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, \\nhe wants to do it with a free mind. Free of worrying about his extremely \\nuncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that has made \\nthis post-season as perplexing as it has been pleasing. But it is \\nnot easy to keep the mind uncluttered. Williams does not know if he \\nwill sign with the Yankees and return to center field next season, \\nbecause he wants to test free agency. There is a good chance the Yankees \\nwill not offer him the most lavish contract, so Williams might be \\nforced to decide between the fattest paycheck and a new situation \\nin the baseball city of his choice or a pretty fat paycheck and a \\nfamiliar situation in the Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared \\nhis client with players in the $10 million-a-year bracket last season, \\nso that price tag has surely escalated after Williams won the American \\nLeague batting title with a .339 average while drilling 26 homers \\nand knocking in 97 runs. Williams was asked if he agreed with the \\ntheory that other teams will outbid the Yankees. ``I do not know,'' \\nsaid Williams, who has been aloof during this post-season, but has \\ndeclined to discuss why. ``And I'm thinking about this a little more \\nthan I would like to. I would like to keep my focus on the series.'' \\nIt is not an issue Williams or the Yankees wants to study Saturday \\nor in the coming days, because the team is four victories away from \\na championship. Still, it is an issue that hovers over the Yankees \\nas ominously as the owner George Steinbrenner hovers over general \\nmanager Brian Cashman. ``It's a tough thing,'' Cashman said about \\nbalancing the excitement of being in the World Series with the reality \\nof trying to re-sign Williams. ``You know the ugliness of the future \\nis right in front of you.'' Although Williams has been adamant about \\nnot discussing the future, he relented slightly Friday. When a reporter \\nasked him what the reasons would be for staying with the Yankees, \\nWilliams' answer included an escape clause. ``Just the fact that I've \\nbeen here my whole career,'' Williams said. ``That has a lot to do \\nwith it. The relationships that I've come to know during the years, \\nI think it would be very hard, but not impossible, to start from scratch \\nsomewhere else.'' Williams continued: ``But I think the reality of \\nthe game in this day and age is things happen. You can't really write \\nthings in stone that they're going to happen. People get traded. People \\nbecome free agents and go to other teams. I have to make a decision \\nreally thinking about all the people I'm accountable for.'' When Williams \\nwas asked what better situation could a player have than being the \\ncenter fielder for the Yankees, winning a batting crown and being \\nin the World Series, the 30-year-old was stumped. ``Wow, that's pretty \\ngood right there,'' Williams said. ``It's funny you mention that, \\nbecause I really haven't thought about any of that. I think, at some \\npoint in the off season, I was going to sit down and think, wow, it \\nwasn't a bad year at all.'' While Cashman would not discuss financial \\nmatters, another Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams \\nas much as $12 million a year _ unless Steinbrenner gets generous \\nafter a possible championship. It is more likely that the Yanks would \\noffer Williams in the $10 million-a-year range. ``I'd hate to have \\nto speculate on something at this point,'' Cashman said. ``We'll give \\nit our best effort to sign him at a level that we're comfortable with. \\nHopefully, that will be enough. Then we'll have a marriage. If not, \\nwe'll have a divorce.'' While Williams has earned the right to become \\na free agent and pursue the contract he wants in the city he wants, \\nhe has interesting choices to make. When a reporter asked Williams \\nhow he would respond to someone who suggested that he accept less \\nfrom the Yankees to remain in a city where he is popular, where he \\nlikes his teammates and manager, and where the team has been in the \\npost-season for four straight years, he did not hesitate to answer. \\n``My response to that would be it's not the time right now to start \\nthinking about that,'' Williams said. ``If I start thinking about \\nthat, it'll distract me to what I need to do in the World Series.'' \\nWilliams then talked about how the Yankees are at the end of a remarkable \\nseason and how he did not want his situation to disrupt that. But, \\nwith Williams' status uncertain, he was asked if the next four to \\nseven games would be bittersweet, since he could be ending a 13-year \\nassociation with the Yankees. ``I don't want to talk about that,'' \\nWilliams said. ``I'm going to have a lot of fun out there. I'm going \\nto go all out.'' Then Williams walked away from the interview. \\n\\nThe moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the bottom of the \\nfirst inning when his name was announced at Yankee Stadium for the \\nfirst time since he neglected to chase down that memorable loose ball \\nlast Wednesday. There were no boos. It was a very warm ovation. They \\nliked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch had \\nemphasized before the game that he was concerned about winning and \\nrumbling into the World Series, not about the fans. But it surely \\nmade Knoblauch feel at home when he realized that the fans had forgiven \\nhim. Victories, more than time, had healed the malice toward Knoblauch \\nand he could play second base without earplugs. When the Yankees defeated \\nthe Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second \\nWorld Series in three years, Knoblauch was easily the most relieved \\nplayer on the field. The awful mistake that he had made in Game 2 \\nwould be forgotten. The Yankees had won the pennant, and Knoblauch \\nwas celebrating as much as anyone. ``To have them act like that toward \\nme was tremendous,'' said Knoblauch, about the response that he received. \\n``It was a great feeling, and it really helped me out.'' Knoblauch \\nwas wearing a cap that declared the Yankees champions of the American \\nLeague in 1998; Champagne dripped off the brim as he spoke. He did \\nnot look up, but continued to talk about how he had learned a lot \\nby being vilified after making a mistake that Little Leaguers are \\nexpected not to make. ``Just to face things and take it like a man \\nand answer all the questions, although they're tough,'' Knoblauch \\nsaid. ``You see what you're made of when you have to bounce back from \\nsomething like that. That's basically what I learned.'' If the Yankees \\nhad lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates had said that \\nhe would be branded as the villain for failing to pursue the ball \\nthat glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he was running outside \\nthe baseline. Knoblauch had argued with the umpire while the go ahead \\nrun scored from first and the Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch can \\nwatch television and read the newspapers again without getting queasy. \\n``That's huge for him,'' David Cone said. ``That's huge for me. I \\nlet them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one \\nif they would have come back and beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's \\nfeeling a lot better now.'' Knoblauch, who had two hits in five at-bats, \\nwas working on his second bottle of Champagne five minutes after reporters \\nwere allowed into the clubhouse. He flashed the sort of smile that \\nhe had not shown too much recently and, now that the Yankees are in \\nthe World Series, Knoblauch should expect to be teased often about \\nhis mistake. ``Maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that,'' Derek \\nJeter said. ``I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something \\ngood.'' \\n\\nTalk about high expectations. It's not just the man from Tampa who \\nhas them anymore. Knowing their baseball as well as they do, everybody \\nin the Joe Torre family passed up tickets for the divisional series \\nand the league championship series as just so much parsley on the \\nplate of life. ``The pressure was on to get to the World Series, so \\nI can see all those people,'' Torre, the Yankees' manager, was saying \\nbefore New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it \\nSan Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night. Now that the Yankees \\nare in the Series, their Florida-based owner and their fans and they \\nthemselves can see nothing more appropriate than four more victories. \\nAnything less than 125 would feel like emptiness. But why should the \\nYankees be any different from the six teams that already fell off \\nthe bus to this World Series? The gloom and doom in the six other \\ncities will not compare to the letdown that would grip New York and \\nthe owner's insatiable little heart should the Yanks come up short. \\nThe three-tiered playoff system has practically turned baseball into \\nfootball, where the survival-of-the-fittest mentality produces one \\nexalted Super Bowl champion and a league full of chumps and losers, \\ncondemned to a nether world of Parcells-like demons kicking them in \\ntheir sore spots for eternity. The World Series used to be a short \\nand sweet reward for excellence, but that was when there were eight \\nteams per league, and the winners met in daylight in early October. \\nEven if the Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers into submission \\nonce again, well, there was always next year. But in 1969, baseball \\nbegan league championship series, and in 1995 it began a two-layered \\nplayoff system. The World Series is still different, which is why \\nwe should all resist the babble of ``post-season records'' flung at \\nus by the hyperactive computers and the hyperactive broadcasters from \\nthe dozens of different networks that carry baseball. The World Series \\nis still a competition between one league that encourages pitchers \\nto be athletes and another league relatively devoid of strategy. Somehow \\nthe ``playoffs'' leave just about everybody feeling inadequate. Think \\nabout it. The Houston Astros are going around feeling they cannot \\nperform in the post-season. The Texas Rangers are sulking because \\nthey had the best hitting in the league and could hardly touch Yankee \\npitching when it counted. In Chicago, the glory of winning a special \\nplayoff for the wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs has been \\npre-empted. The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern \\ntitle held a parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyons where Lindbergh \\nand John Glenn and the 1969 Mets were once hailed. Speaking of indignity, \\nthere are the Red Sox, whose occasional qualification for the playoffs \\nis merely a signal that nothing good can come of it. In Atlanta, the \\nteam of the '90s has won exactly one World Series, and now it is up \\nto management to keep repeating that: ``The main goal is to get to \\nthe Series. This is a recorded announcement. This is a recorded announcement. \\nThis is a recorded announcement.'' In Cleveland, the fans had to live \\nwith the phrase ``Nineteen forty-eight!'' being chanted at the Indians \\nin the Bronx as the Yankees put the Indians out of misery. That leaves \\nthe Padres as the only team with virtually nothing to lose. This can \\nbe good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, the manager, a reserve on \\nthe 1984 San Diego World Series team, has said: ``A lot of the players \\non that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had a little \\ndifferent attitude instead of just saying, `Hey, we are in the World \\nSeries.' And this year, I think you will see the players out there \\nplaying to win.'' Torre recalled being the underdog in 1996, but he \\nsaid his Yankees felt they could beat the Braves. ``I am sure that \\nis the way the Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't \\npredicting a lot for them, but I am sure they are for themselves,'' \\nTorre said. ``I think getting here is where the pressure is,'' Torre \\nadded. ``You want to win, but getting to the World Series is so tough \\nafter playing 162 games and getting into post-season and then having \\nto fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get here.'' Torre \\ncontinued: ``You don't think about in spring training that we want \\nto go and win the World Series. You want to get to the World Series. \\nThen you get there, well, you have played well enough and won enough \\ngames, then of course, we want to win. ``As far as legitimizing our \\nseason _ I hate to even think in negative terms, but if San Diego \\nhappens to win the World Series, sure it takes a little bit of the \\nluster off what we have accomplished by getting here, but I think \\nthat was our goal, initially.'' The key word in that sentence is ``initially.'' \\nThe Yankees built an insatiable demand for more victories _ and World \\nSeries tickets in the Torre family. While they're at it, the Yankees \\nhad better win the whole thing. They are a victim of their own excellence. \\n\", \"\\nThai police have detained more than 300 beggars, most from neighboring \\ncountries, in a campaign to make Bangkok's streets safer for spectators \\nand athletes arriving for the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police \\nofficer said Friday. Arrests were made throughout Bangkok during a \\nfour-day crackdown on panhandlers. About 100 of those detained were \\ndisplayed Friday to local and foreign press at a detention center \\nin Bangkok. ``Most come here because of economic hardship,'' said \\nMaj. Gen. Chanvut Vajrabukka, deputy commissioner for the immigration \\npolice. ``There are some beggars, however, who are under control of \\ngangsters. They could cause trouble for tourists and athletes.'' Other \\ngroups targeted by police in advance of the Asian Games are foreign \\ncriminal gangs believed to operate in Bangkok and other major cities \\nin Thailand. The Asian Games will be held from the Dec. 6-20. \\n\\nFor some teams, ``out of bounds'' at the Asian Games means more than \\njust a line on a soccer field or basketball floor. That's because \\nthe host city offers the punchy mix of Viagra and notorious night \\nlife. The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the \\ngames opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder \\ndrug and ``night life ideas.'' The Indian team's solution is mandatory \\nmeetings for all athletes before bedtime. The Sri Lankan participants, \\nwho had to sign a code of conduct before coming to Bangkok, are being \\nwatched by an army brigadier with a track record of high discipline. \\nThe Chinese have done their homework on staying out of trouble. Thailand, \\nespecially the capital Bangkok, is known worldwide for its titillating \\nnight life. From taxi drivers to local tourist magazines distributed \\nfree at hotels, there are messengers aplenty to advertise massage \\nparlors and escort services. Minutely detailed photo albums seek to \\narouse sensual fantasies. Estimates of the number of female sex workers \\nin Thailand, a country of 60 million, range from more than 300,000 \\nto 2 million. Under Thailand's drug rules, Viagra is not available \\nin drug stores, but is sold only in hospital pharmacies with a prescription \\nfrom a urologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist or psychiatrist for \\n400 baht (about dlrs 10) a dose. But there is a black market in the \\ndrug that might prove an attraction for some among the more than 15,000 \\nathletes, officials and media personnel in Bangkok. ``No way,'' said \\nGurdayal Singh Mander, leader of the Indian contingent, when asked \\nif there was a risk of lack in discipline. ``I believe no one will \\ntry anything silly in Bangkok. Even if they try, our watching system \\nis watertight and we will know,'' said Mander, a former police officer. \\nIndian officials in charge of various sports meet their athletes at \\n10 p.m. before bedtime at the Asian Games village. The Pakistanis \\nhave opted for trust and nationalism. ``Oh, Viagra,'' exclaimed Pakistani \\nmedical officer Yousef Baig. ``They know all about it and they know \\nall about Bangkok. We have told them, don't break our trust and keep \\nthe good name of Pakistan flying high,'' Dr. Baig said. China has \\ntaken a similar approach. ``We don't treat them as kids, telling them \\ndon't do this, don't do that. We just told them to leave a good impression \\nof Chinese athletes,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of the Chinese \\ndelegation. For the Sri Lankans, ``we have told them that they will \\nnot be allowed outside the games village until they finish their discipline,'' \\nsaid Upali Bandaratillaka, a serving brigadier in the Sri Lankan army. \\n``Even if they want to go to shopping, one of us will accompany them,'' \\nBandaratillaka said. His deputy is a police officer. Host Thailand \\nis stressing that sex isn't lurking around every corner. A ``Traditional \\nThai Massage Parlor'' has been opened at the games' village. ``Thai \\ntraditional massage is considered an art form,'' said Prarop Laovanich, \\nsecretary of the Asian Games Sub-Committee for Culture and Performance. \\n``A skilled masseur can cure ailments and muscular fatigue.'' And \\none must wear baggy white pajamas before a traditional Thai massage. \\n\\nOrganizers of December's Asian Games have dismissed press reports \\nthat a sports complex would not be completed on time, saying preparations \\nare well in hand, a local newspaper said Friday. Santiparb Tejavanija, \\ndeputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, \\nsaid construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing \\nestate is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month, the \\nBangkok Post reported. Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company \\nthat owns the housing estate, threatened to prevent the company from \\nfinishing the complex in time for the Dec. 6-20 games. Deputy Prime \\nMinister Bhichai Rattakul, who chairs the organizing committee, expressed \\ndoubt last month that the complex would be completed on time because \\nof the financial problems. Santiparb told the Post the money problems \\nhad been overcome by shifting 200 million baht (dlrs 5 million) worth \\nof credit guarantees from a project that had been scrapped to cover \\nthe construction cost of the complex. Preparations for the games have \\nbeen plagued by political interference by previous governments, alleged \\ncorruption and incompetence. The decision to award the contract for \\nthe sports complex was controversial, with critics calling it an attempt \\nto bail out the property developer's failed housing estate. Doubts \\nover Thailand's ability to stage the games increased over the past \\nyear-and-a-half after the country entered its worst economic downturn \\nin decades. The body governing the games threatened several times \\nto award Asia's version of the Olympics to other countries, but Thailand \\nargued that all would be ready by opening day. The Bangkok games are \\nexpected to attract more than 10,000 athletes from 43 nations. \\n\\nIn rites building from low flares symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron \\nlighting, Thailand's king opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving \\nThais some respite from an economic crisis that once threatened the \\ncontinent's Olympic-style event. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's \\nlongest-reigning monarch, was upstaged slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi. \\nIn a marathon run in early morning, to avoid the worst of Bangkok's \\ntropical heat, she won the games' first gold medal in a time just \\none minute off the world record. Her medal ceremony immediately preceded \\nthe official opening festivities for two weeks of competition among \\n6,000 athletes from 41 nations. In all, 377 gold medals are at stake \\nin 36 sports, including Asian specialities such as kabaddi and sepak \\ntakraw. But the king not only made the key proclamation and released \\nthe royal pigeon, he also anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium \\nand composed some of the music. Songs written by the king, a talented \\njazz composer, were played by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra. Thai \\nofficials who approached him at the ceremony did so on their knees. \\nOthers greeting the king included International Olympic Committee \\nPresident Juan Antonio Samaranch. A cascade of fireworks in honor \\nof his 71st birthday Saturday and dancers who prostrated themselves \\non the field welcomed the monarch to his seat in the royal box. Then \\ncame the athletes, starting with Cambodia and ending with the host \\nThai team. Saudi Arabia, which withdrew its team at the last minute, \\nwas represented by only a flag bearer. The Sri Lankan team was led \\nby six dancers in bright costumes, who delighted the crowd in the \\n60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic maneuvers. Each team was led by \\na Thai beauty queen holding its signboard. After the parade, five \\nof the women collapsed, and three were taken out on stretchers. A \\ngiant cauldron atop the stadium was lit by touching a torch to a smaller \\ncauldron inside a model of a temple, which then was lifted on an elevator \\nand sent an explosion of sparks into the games' flame receptacle. \\nOutside the stadium before the ceremony, long lines of people waited \\nto take photos of themselves in front of a plastic statue of the games' \\nelephant mascot, ``Chai-yo.'' One, Sakchai Pungsrinon, a 30-year-old \\npiping engineer, who paid 1,000 baht (dlrs 26) for his ceremonies \\nticket, said, ``Thailand has many problems. Asia also has many problems. \\nFor two weeks, maybe we can forget about all these problems.'' Several \\nthousand people without tickets milled around outside, waving small \\nThai flags and waiting for a glimpse of the king. They also could \\nwatch the ceremony on a large television screen. Security measures \\nincluded bomb-sniffing dogs. For the competing nations _ many sending \\nreduced teams to ease the pinch of the Asian crisis _ the games are \\na proving ground for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. ``It's \\nnot just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a result that is \\nclose or at world standards,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of China's \\nAsian Games delegation. ``The main target is the 2000 Olympics.'' \\nSunday's focus was more on pageantry, beginning with slightly built \\nPrime Minister Chuan Leekpai leading off a torch relay at 9:09 a.m. \\n(0209 GMT), reflecting popular belief that nine is a lucky number. \\nBhumibol is the ninth king of the current dynasty. The three-hour \\nceremonies featured 7,614 performers in lavishly produced acts with \\nthe theme ``Friendship Beyond Frontiers.'' Performers in ancient Thai \\ngarb paraded across the field, followed by people-drawn chariots. \\nA martial arts display celebrated Asian unity, and hundreds of primary \\nschool students dressed in colorful outfits introduced the games' \\nmascot. Parts of the ceremony were built around the Indian Ramayana \\nepic, the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology, literature \\nand performing and fine arts. The field became a swirl of giant snakes, \\nswans, birds, angels, and other mystical creatures. Another performance \\ncelebrating the unity of Asia capped the show, with four large swan \\nfloats pulled to the middle of the field, each tethered to a giant \\nballoon symbolizing the sun, moon, earth and a giant lotus. Fireworks \\nburst overhead, searchlights played across the stadium and lasers \\nsplit the darkness before the royal anthem concluded the program. \\nThe combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies was 70 \\nmillion baht (dlrs 1.94 million), including a large share of donated \\nand at-cost labor _ part of Thailand's remedy for overcoming financial \\nproblems that hit the games. In warming up the audience before the \\nceremonies, a Thai comedian jested: ``If you're Saudi, raise your \\nhand.'' Saudi Arabia withdrew from the games at the last minute, throwing \\nsome of the scheduling into disarray. It cited a national holiday \\nand the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, but many Thais saw the move \\nas retaliation for the failure of Thai police to solve a number of \\nserious crimes against Saudi citizens. \\n\\nChina's national soccer team could call back four players from overseas \\nto boost its chances at the Asian Games in Thailand in December, an \\nofficial newspaper reported Monday. Two of the players, Fan Zhiyi \\nand Sun Jihai, play for Crystal Palace in the English First Division. \\nAnother, Yang Chen, plays in Germany, while Li Jinyu is with Nantes \\nin France. Englishman Bob Houghton, who coaches the national team, \\nsaid recalling Fan and Sun for the Asian Games would allow him to \\n``see if they can bring the things they have learned recently in England \\nto the national team,'' the China Sports Daily said. Houghton also \\nsaid that Yang, who plays in Frankfurt, ``very possibly could become \\nan extremely important player in the national team,'' the newspaper \\nreported. Li, who has not had many chances to play since his move \\nto France, also ``is very willing to come back,'' the newspaper said. \\nChina and South Korea will both field their Asian Games teams at a \\nfriendly warm-up match Nov. 22, the newspaper said. The Asian Games \\nare held every four years. \\n\\nSaudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Games left organizers \\nscrambling Thursday to change schedules and Thai diplomats mulling \\na decade of relations strained by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats. \\nBhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok \\nAsian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign Ministry to urge \\nthe Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its 105-strong team. \\nThe games open Dec. 6. ``We're not sure if this is related to the \\nSaudi jewel scandal,'' Bhichai told Thai radio. ``But regardless, \\nwe should not mix sports with politics.'' In a letter to the Thai \\nprime minister's office, reported Thursday by Bangkok newspapers, \\nSaudi sports authorities cited the looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan \\nand national centenary celebrations as reasons for suddenly pulling \\nout. But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason was the \\ncontinued strain in relations since a Thai janitor stole precious \\njewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and fled home. Thai \\npolice recovered the jewels and returned them, but many were fakes \\n_ leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers and members \\nof Thailand's power elite kept the loot. The real jewels have never \\nbeen recovered. Tensions were aggravated in 1990 and 1991, when three \\nSaudi diplomats were murdered in Bangkok. In retaliation, the Saudis \\nbarred new Thai guest workers and refused to renew the visas of the \\nthousands already in the desert kingdom. The killings remain unsolved. \\nSaudi Arabia has said relations would be normalized only when the \\ntwo cases were solved. Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, \\nsaid it would be understandable if Saudi Arabia pulls out because \\nof Ramadan fasting. ``If there is any other reason behind this, such \\nas the jewelry case and the murders, we will regret it very much because \\nsports should be separated from politics,'' Kobsak said. Organizers \\nnoted that 10 other Muslim nations are sending teams. Suggestions \\nwere made that in the future, the Olympic Council of Asia should consider \\npunishing last-minute withdrawals. Organizers need to hold new draws \\nfor both handball and basketball because of the pullout, but said \\nthe live television coverage schedule will not be affected. The withdrawal \\nis expected to cost 30 million baht (dlrs 830,000) to cover the committee's \\nexpenses for organizing programs, accommodation and television schedules. \\nThey said they would consult with the council, which oversees the \\norganization of the games, about the impact of the Saudi withdrawal. \\nOfficials, meanwhile, expressed shock over a brawl that erupted Tuesday \\nduring a friendly soccer match between Thailand and Qatar. The scoreless \\nmatch was suspended without further play after players from both sides \\nkicked, punched and body-slammed each other for about 10 minutes. \\nSeveral suffered light injuries. ``As a host, surely the melee will \\nhave an impact on the image and reputation of Thailand,'' said Santiparb \\nTejavanija, chairman of the administrative committee. ``Nobody wanted \\nthat incident to happen.'' Officials said that forgiveness was a better \\noption than punishment and that both sides would be admonished not \\nto let a repeat brawl occur. \\n\\nHorses belonging to Iran's equestrian team will not be allowed to \\ncompete in next month's Asian Games because they failed to meet the \\nrequirements of the games' veterinary commission, the Thai organizers \\nannounced Thursday. The three horses originally came from Iran, but \\narrived in Thailand after a training period in the United States. \\nThey did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing that \\nthey are disease-free, said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary \\nCommission for the games. This is the first Asian Games in which competitors \\nhave been allowed to bring their own horses from abroad. According \\nto regulations, all participating horses had to be screened for a \\nnumber of diseases before arriving in Thailand. Siraya said she felt \\nsorry for the Iranian team because the problem resulted from ignorance \\nof the rules. Iran is the only country that did not pass the requirements. \\n``They are the most beautiful horses of all,'' she said. ``I am so \\nsorry for the team but cannot allow them to compete because it is \\nagainst the rules and it might affect other horses' good health.'' \\nThere is only one Thai horse available on standby for the Iranians, \\nas Thailand was not prepared for such a problem, Siraya said. ``If \\nthe Iranian team can borrow a couple of more horses from other participating \\ncountries, they still can compete,'' she said. There are 106 horses \\nand 12 countries participating in the equestrian events. Most of the \\nhorses actually come from Europe and the United States. Thailand has \\nprovided a climate-controlled stable and field cleared of contaminants \\nto help the horses become acclimatized to the tropical heat before \\nthe competition begins Dec. 8. Many of the horses are suffering stress \\nfrom the journey here, but those from Asian countries are adjusting \\nfaster than those from cold countries, Siraya said. \\n\\nSaudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian \\nGames from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official \\nsaid Saturday. Saudi Arabia's top sports official, Prince Faisal bin \\nFahd, is studying a proposal by the Olympic Council of Asia to at \\nleast send a symbolic delegation to the Dec. 6-20 Games, said the \\nofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity. The plea to reconsider \\nwas made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic \\nCouncil of Asia. Sheik Ahmad, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, \\nis a friend of Prince Faisal. Saudi Arabia's sudden announcement Wednesday \\nthat it is withdrawing its 105-member team shocked hosts Thailand, \\nwho remain skeptical about the official reasons offered. Saudi sports \\nauthorities said the Games conflicted with national centenary celebrations \\nand the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. But observers point rather to \\nSaudi anger at the failure of Thai authorities to solve two, decade-old \\ncriminal cases involving their nationals: the theft of dlrs 20 million \\nworth of jewels from a Saudi prince and the murder of three Saudi \\ndiplomats in Bangkok. The cases are widely believed to involve people \\nhigh up in the power hierarchy, who in Thailand rarely face prosecution. \\nSaudi Arabia has in the past said relations would only be normalized \\nwhen the two cases were solved. Thai newspapers reported Saturday \\nthat attempts to convince Saudi Arabia to participate in the upcoming \\n13th Asian Games have failed. Thai Olympic Committee Chairman Gen. \\nChettha Thanajaro told the Bangkok Post he sent a last-minute plea \\nto his Saudi counterpart but has received no response. ``I have done \\nmy best. We have to respect their decision,'' he told the Post. The \\nwithdrawal has thrown the Games' schedules into disarray. \\n\\nThailand showed its nearly complete facilities for the Asian Games \\nto a tough jury Thursday _ the heads of the organizing committees \\nfrom the 43 nations competing in the December event. Thailand won \\nhost rights for the quadrennial games in 1995, but setbacks in preparations \\nled officials of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten \\nto move the games to another country. They complained that the Thai \\norganizers were behind in constructing facilities and had failed to \\nkeep them informed. It appeared that Thursday's tour was successful \\nin reassuring everyone. ``We have a strong of sense of relief,'' said \\nAbdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Kuwait-based Olympic \\nCouncil of Asia and a frequent critic of Thailand's organizing committee. \\n``Everything is 99 percent completed.'' In a welcoming speech, Thai \\nDeputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, also chairman of the Thai \\norganizing committee, told delegation members to cast aside any doubts \\nover whether the Dec. 6-20 games will be a success. ``I can hereby \\nconfirm that regardless of what Thailand has faced, we ... have tried \\nto accommodate all requests for the 13th Asian Games,'' said Bhichai. \\nSince the Thai organizers began their preparations, they have faced \\nmany difficulties, most of them resulting from the country's financial \\ncrisis, he said. But the country was able to pull it through, he added. \\n``This is an example of Asia's resiliency. We have financial problems \\nin all of Asia but still we are able to prepare commendably,'' said \\nManuel Veguillas, head of the Philippine delegation. ``I am impressed,'' \\nsaid Tu Mingde, secretary-general of China's Olympic Committee. ``The \\ngames will be a success.'' Still, Bangkok's infamous traffic jams \\ndid not go overlooked. ``My only concern now is the road construction \\nleading to the site,'' said Kenji Ono from Japan. Construction workers \\nare trying to ensure that the road leading to the stadium, including \\na flyover at a key intersection, will be completed on time for the \\ngames. The Olympic Council of Asia, meanwhile, is working with the \\nBangkok Organizing Committee to come up with a contingency plan in \\ncase of any possible emergency, said its director general, Muttaleb. \\n``You cannot really anticipate anything,'' he said, as he toured the \\nmain stadium of the Sports Authority of Thailand. ``Any venue can \\nhave a problem, such as electrical failure.'' \\n\\nA snooker game between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan led \\nto a flareup of tempers Sunday, showing a depth of differences that \\nshocked Thai organizers and spectators at the Asian Games. India and \\nPakistan have fought three wars since becoming independent in 1947. \\nA Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant had committed \\na foul during a decisive frame sparked a fierce debate with the referee \\nthat forced stoppage of play for 15 minutes. Merchant defeated Mohammad \\nSaleh 5-4 after order was restored, but the incident not only violated \\nthe sport's strict etiquette, but showed the distrust between the \\ntwo neighbors that often has spilled over into sports. The referee \\nruled that Merchant's white cue ball had first touched the black before \\nhitting the target, red. Merchant protested. With the referee refusing \\nto reverse his decision, Merchant sought help from the Indian team. \\nSeveral Indian team members went to the playing arena, and one of \\nthem wrote a quick protest letter using the snooker table as a writing \\nplatform. Disgusted spectators viewed it as a breach of snooker etiquette. \\n``It does not look nice for grownup men wearing neckties to fight,'' \\nsaid Pakistani team manager Shahnawaz Khan. ``We just watched the \\nwhole drama,'' he said. Pakistani team officials did not intervene, \\ninstead staying in their allocated seats. ``It was made very clear \\nto everybody that a referee's decision will be final, but now that \\nthe Indians have lodged a formal complaint, we have also done so,'' \\nKhan said. The Indian complaint, however, has no meaning now as Merchant \\nhas won. Indian officials were not available for comment. Tournament \\ndirector Surasak Werapong said both complaints were thrown out because \\nneither side paid the required dlrs 50 filing fee. The match was one \\nof the first as snooker made its Asian Games debut in style, with \\nelated officials greeting the opening with muffled clapping, in keeping \\nwith the sport's etiquette. A total of 19 countries are vying for \\n10 gold medals in snooker and billiards. The preliminary elimination \\nrounds began Sunday. ``This is the brightest day for us,'' said Manmohanjit \\nSingh, the Singapore-born president of the International Billiards \\nand Snooker Federation, the sport's world governing body. ``This is \\nindeed a high step and this will greatly help to make the sport more \\npopular in Asia, which is coming up fast,'' said Singh, whose family \\nmigrated to Singapore from India several decades ago. With the addition \\nof snooker, the Asian Games now have 36 sports. \\n\", \"\\nMargaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto \\nPinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in \\na London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid \\ngrowing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move. Pinochet, \\nwho has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations \\nof murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and \\nher husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district \\nfour days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. \\n9. ``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington, \\nspokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister \\nfrom 1979-90. The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish \\nmagistrate's request. In Conservative government days, Pinochet was \\nwelcomed on regular visits that included tea with the prime minister. \\nHe was the only Latin American leader to support Britain in its 1982 \\nwar against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands. Pinochet and \\nLady Thatcher also implemented similar brands of right-wing economics. \\nThe current visit is Pincohet's first since Prime Minister Tony Blair's \\nLabor Party administration was elected 18 months ago, ending 18 years \\nof Conservative Party rule. Chile's ambassador delivered a formal \\nprotest to the Foreign Office on Monday, saying Britain has violated \\nPinochet's diplomatic immunity. He arrived last month on a diplomatic \\npassport and is also a senator-for-life in Chile, which protects him \\nfrom prosecution there. Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked by torture \\nand other human rights abuses against political opponents in which, \\nthe Chilean government has said, 4,299 people were killed or vanished. \\nHe remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March. The magistrate \\nbroadened his charges Monday to include killings of Chileans as well \\nas Spaniards, and genocide _ for which there is no diplomatic immunity. \\nChilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during Pinochet's \\nrule, said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity \\nand senator status. ``We are not protecting the dictator of the '70s,'' \\nArtaza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday. \\n``What we are fighting for and discussing with the (British) government \\nis the special situation of a senator in our transition who many people \\ndo not understand and many people don't like.'' ``We're not discussing \\nhis record during his period of dictatorship, that the present government \\ndoes not support at all,'' added the ambassador. A Chilean specialist \\nin international law was traveling to London for further meetings \\nwith British officials, Artaza said. Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized \\nfor perhaps two more weeks faces a long battle through British courts \\nto avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who instigated \\nthe proceedings, and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's \\ncourt. British Conservative Party lawmakers accuse the Labor government \\nof ``gesture'' politics and pandering to the party's left-wing. \\n\\nThe Swiss government has ordered no investigation of possible bank \\naccounts belonging to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a \\nspokesman said Wednesday. Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said \\na Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition \\naimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have \\nin Luxembourg and Switzerland. But government spokesman Achille Casanova \\nsaid no accounts have so far been frozen in Switzerland and no investigation \\norder has been given to federal banking authorities. Pinochet has \\nbeen held at a London clinic since his arrest earlier this month. \\nSpanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges \\nof genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended \\n1990. On Monday, Switzerland also requested Pinochet's arrest and \\nextradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. The move \\nfollowed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva last week by the widow \\nof Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual nationality who \\ndisappeared in May 1977. Swiss authorities said the Spanish effort \\nto extradite Pinochet should be given priority. A Spanish request \\nfor legal assistance from Switzerland, made Friday, has been passed \\non to Geneva authorities. No details have been given of the content \\nof the Spanish request. \\n\\nCuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest \\nin London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it \\na case of ``international meddling.'' ``It seems to me that what has \\nhappened there (in London) is universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters \\ncovering the Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro \\nhad just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city \\nhotel. He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.'' \\nPinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British \\npolice acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The judge is \\nprobing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his \\nrule in the 1970s and 80s. The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's \\narrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic \\npassport and had immunity from arrest. Castro, Latin America's only \\nremaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case \\nagainst Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of \\nChile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while \\nFrei is attending the summit. Castro compared the action with the \\nestablishment in Rome in August of an International Criminal Court, \\na move Cuba has expressed reservations about. Castro said the court \\nought to be independent of the U.N. Security Council, because ``we \\nalready know who commands there,'' an apparent reference to the United \\nStates. The United States was one of only seven countries that voted \\nagainst creating the court. ``The (Pinochet) case is serious ... the \\nproblem is delicate'' and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament \\nand armed forces bear watching, Castro said. He expressed surprise \\nthat the British had arrested Pinochet, especially since he had provided \\nsupport to England during its 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland \\nIslands. Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was \\naccused of providing military intelligence to the British. Castro \\njoked that he would have thought police could have waited another \\n24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit \\nbeing held here. ``Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet \\ninstead of the summit,'' he said. Pinochet left government in 1990, \\nbut remained as army chief until March when he became a senator-for-life. \\n\\nAs his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for \\nGen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began \\nin Geneva and Paris to have him extradited. In London, where Pinochet \\nhas been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx \\nof British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the \\narrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, \\nis not a Spanish citizen. They also maintained that as a former head \\nof state, the general had diplomatic immunity for actions taken while \\nin office. His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite \\nthe general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could \\nbe extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine \\nsoldiers in the Falklands war in 1982. On the opposing side, Alun \\nJones, a British government lawyer acting as prosecutor in the case, \\ndefended the Spanish warrant, which led to the general's detention \\nin London. The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general was \\nresponsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to \\ndestroy a national group _ Chilean nationals who did not share his \\nideological values.'' After hearing the arguments in a court crowded \\nwith Chilean exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's \\nsenior judge, said the court was expected to decide the matter on \\nTuesday. The Chilean air force has sent an ambulance plane to Britain \\nin hope of the general's early release. But efforts to prevent that \\ngathered strength elsewhere in Europe. In Geneva, a public prosecutor, \\nBernard Bertossa, said Monday that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet's \\narrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss-Chilean \\ncitizen in 1977. Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation \\nin response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard, \\nwho was 25 when he was tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared. \\nThe prosecutor said he was asking the Swiss federal government to \\nseek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva. \\nAt the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three French citizens, \\nof whom two disappeared and one was killed in Chile during the 1973-90 \\ndictatorship, filed suit in a French court. In addition, a human rights \\ngroup in Paris said Monday that it had filed a suit with a Paris court \\non behalf of Anne Marie Pesle, whose father, Etienne Pesle, disappeared \\nin Chile in 1973. In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating \\nmagistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he \\nhad formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg \\nto block bank accounts held by the general. Court officials in Madrid \\nsaid Garzon wanted any accounts blocked with a view to their possible \\nuse later as compensation to relatives of victims. In London, British \\nofficials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the \\ncourts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political \\nactivity both in Britain and in Chile. Supporters and opponents of \\nthe dictator have traveled to the London clinic where he is being \\nheld. From Chile have come six right-wing senators, the deputy foreign \\nminister, aides and legal experts who file in and out of the private \\nclinic in central London. From Europe have come dozens of longtime \\nopponents of the general who were forced into exile after his 1973 \\ncoup against the elected Socialist president, Salvador Allende Gossens. \\nThe exiles, along with others, stand daily outside the clinic holding \\nup photographs of missing relatives and shouting anti-Pinochet slogans. \\nOn occasion there have been shouting matches between the two sides. \\n``He is ill, and in a few days he will be 83,'' Mariano Fernandez, \\nChile's deputy foreign minister, said after visiting Pinochet who \\nhad minor surgery for a back ailment. After his surgery on Oct. 9, \\nthe general was arrested by Scotland Yard during the night of Oct. \\n16. The diplomatic and judicial entanglements that ensued now involve \\nat least five governments. The political and legal imbroglio could \\nend if Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, decides that the general \\nshould be released on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his age \\nand failing health. Last week he said that in exercising his powers \\nunder the 1989 Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offenses \\nare of a ``political character'' and he would take into account ``any \\ncompassionate circumstances.'' \\n\\nThe Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking \\nshelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition \\nof former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. ``Despite everything \\nthat has been written, this is not a decision for the British government \\nor the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said \\nin an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday. In \\na similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez said \\nWednesday: ``The government should not have any opinion about the \\nextradition.'' British police, acting on an international arrest warrant \\nfrom Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing \\ngeneral in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. \\nThe detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to \\nstand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year \\ndictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide. \\nBut it sparked protests from the Chilean government, and fears it \\ncould damage economic relations. In 1997, seven years after Pinochet \\nleft power, Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile, followed \\nclosely by Britain. Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that \\nPinochet's detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical \\nForeign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within \\nhis Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator. \\n``This is about two legal systems united by an extradition treaty \\nbut nobody seems to understand this,'' he said. Blair added that should \\nHome Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and \\nact ``as if he were a judge,'' should he be required to make a decision \\non an extradition request from Spain. The tone of the British Prime \\nMinister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with \\nSunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter \\nMandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for \\nPinochet ``gut-wrenching.'' The European extradition convention gives \\nGarzon 40 days to present a formal extradition request to the British \\nauthorities via the Spanish government. But while Spanish Prime Minister \\nJose Maria Aznar has promised his government would rubber stamp the \\nprocess if it reaches his desk, he appears to be hoping he will never \\nhave to do so. Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have \\nappealed the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile \\nand Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. ``Depending on \\nthe result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition \\nrequest) will never reach the government so perhaps the government \\nwill never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in \\nWednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais. The appeals argue \\nthat crimes committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are \\nnone of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international \\ncourts. A ruling on the appeals is expected next week, and a decision \\nin their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt. \\n\\nA delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible \\nextradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday \\nthat Chile was on the brink of political turmoil. ``There is a climate \\nof division, confrontation and instability in Chile,'' parliamentary \\ndeputy Alberto Espina told reporters in Madrid after meeting the Chilean \\nambassador. Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation \\nof Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite \\nthe former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. \\nIn Chile, the detention triggered both celebrations by relatives of \\nvictims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and protests from the retired \\ngeneral's supporters. Espina also warned that the issue was damaging \\nrelations between Chile Spain and Britain. Spain was the biggest single \\ninvestor in Chile last year, followed closely by Britain. The deputy \\narrived in Madrid late Wednesday accompanied by the senators Jovino \\nMovoa and Julio Lagos. The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group \\nof Chilean parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in \\nLondon on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic \\nUnion and the National Renovation Party. Espina, Movoa and Lagos were \\nhoping to talk to officials from the Spanish Foreign Ministry and \\nother government representatives. ``All we ask is that Spain stops \\nmeddling in our internal affairs,'' Espina said, arguing that Chilean \\nproblems should be dealt with by Chilean courts. ``We stopped being \\na Spanish colony 188 years ago and we have no intention of becoming \\none again,'' he added. Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime \\nMinister Jose Maria Aznar had no plans to meet the delegation, the \\nstate-owned news agency EFE reported. Aznar has promised his government \\nwill rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the British government \\nif asked to do so by the judicial authorities. But the extradition \\nattempt could be annulled by legal challenges in Spain well before \\nthe deadline for presenting it in Britain. The deadline is set for \\nNovember 25th _ coincidentally Pinochet's 83rd birthday. On Thursday \\nthe head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals \\nagainst several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's \\ndetention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. \\nThe court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an \\nearlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human \\nrights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest \\nwarrant. A ruling that the investigations are outside the jurisdiction \\nof Spanish law would made any extradition request difficult. The decision \\nis likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism are interpreted, as \\nthese crimes are specifically mentioned in the Spanish legal code. \\n\\nEurope's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator \\nAugusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes \\ncommitted during his 17-year rule. ``Sometimes it should be made clear \\nthat crimes, wherever they take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' \\nEuropean Commission President Jacques Santer said. Pinochet was detained \\nby British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate \\nas a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide \\nand terrorism. ``The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent \\nmany citizens into exile,'' Santer said, referring to the 1973-90 \\nPinochet regime. Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern \\nSpanish city of Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias \\nPrize for social science _ one of the eight annual prizes named after \\nthe heir to the Spanish throne. Meanwhile, a Spanish newspaper reported \\nFriday that Pinochet is not fully aware of his predicament. Daily \\nEl Mundo said the ailing retired general's family and aides have been \\nshielding him from the details for fear he would fly into a rage that \\nwould kill him. Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering \\nfrom back surgery. El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean \\npoliticians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday. \\nThe reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart, \\nand daughter Veronica. ``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have \\nan attack of rage and die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to \\nothers while waiting for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her \\nhusband on the eighth floor of the clinic. She said she was particularly \\nconcerned because he is also suffering from a urinary infection, heart \\nproblems and diabetes, the newspaper reported. El Mundo reported that \\nthe family had asked police guards to stand outside the former dictator's \\nroom and keep out of sight. The paper said the room lacked television, \\nradio or telephone. According to the report Pinochet was informed \\nof the arrest order from two policemen, but is convinced it was a \\nmistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Meanwhile, \\na Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer \\nclose to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation \\nafter flying to London Thursday. TV13 reported that the unidentified \\nofficer said Pinochet reacted calmly to the news imparted ``as one \\nsoldier to another.'' \\n\\nThe wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for \\nhis release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face \\ncharges of genocide. ''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful \\nLucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London \\nClinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back \\nsurgery. 'I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very, \\nvery, very, ill.'' Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated \\ndisc, a painful spinal disorder which had hindered his movement. He \\nwas arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking \\nto extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. The \\nSpanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to include \\nsome 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year-rule. \\nChile argues that Pinochet must be released because as a senator he \\nenjoys diplomatic immunity _ and because he is in poor health. Unconfirmed \\nmedia reports in Chile this week indicated that Pinochet, who has \\nworn a pacemaker for years and is diabetic, also has a urinary tract \\ninfection. There have also been reports that he is suffering from \\ndepression. In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers \\nfor the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British \\npolice acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant. The case \\nresumes Monday. Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army \\ncommander until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator \\nfor life, as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted. \\n\\nBritain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one \\nlawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator \\nhas diplomatic immunity is ridiculous. Chilean officials, meanwhile, \\nissued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to \\nargue for Pinochet's release. The former strongman's son vowed to \\nhire top attorneys to defend his 82-year-old father, who ruled Chile \\nwith an iron fist for 17 years. British police arrested Pinochet in \\nhis bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request \\nfrom Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of \\nmurder during the decade after he seized power in 1973. Pinochet had \\ngone to the hospital to have a back operation Oct. 9. ``The idea that \\nsuch a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity \\nI think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching \\nstuff,'' Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting \\nCorp. television interview Sunday. Home Office Minister Alun Michael \\nacknowledged Sunday that Pinochet entered Britain on a diplomatic \\npassport, but said, ``That does not necessarily convey diplomatic \\nimmunity.'' The Foreign Office said only government officials visiting \\non official business and accredited diplomats have immunity. Pinochet \\nhas been a regular visitor to Britain, generally without publicity. \\nHis arrest this time appeared to reflect a tougher attitude toward \\nright-wing dictators by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government, \\nwhich replaced a Conservative Party administration 18 months ago and \\npromised an ``ethical'' foreign policy. However, Michael Howard, a \\nConservative spokesman and former Cabinet minister, said he was concerned \\nthat Pinochet was arrested as a result of pressure from Labor lawmakers \\nand lobby groups. Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticized the arrest, \\nsaying the Spanish magistrate's arrest order was tantamount to not \\nrecognizing Chile's institutions. ``Spain also lived under an authoritarian \\nfor 40 years and many of its present institutions are inherited from \\nthat regime,'' Frei said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending \\nthe Ibero-American Summit. ``Would a Chilean court be allowed to start \\na trial for abuses that occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime \\n(of Francisco Franco)?'' Frei asked. ``It is only for Chilean courts \\nto try events that occurred in Chile.'' Franco's reign ended in 1975. \\nPinochet's family issued a statement Sunday calling the arrest ``an \\ninsult'' and thanking the Chilean government, rightist politicians \\nand the military for their support. In London, police guards were \\ndeployed Sunday outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is believed \\nto still be a patient. About 100 Chilean demonstrators pleased with \\nthe arrest gathered outside, chanting and waving placards bearing \\nfaded black and white portraits with the caption ``Disappeared in \\nChile.'' Across the Atlantic, the Chilean capital of Santiago was \\nthe scene of dueling demonstrations Sunday, reflecting the long-standing \\ndivision of public opinion over Pinochet. The rallies were mostly \\npeaceful, although riot police used tear gas and water cannons on \\nsome pro-Pinochet protesters trying to break through police lines \\ninto the British embassy on Sunday evening. No arrests or injuries \\nwere reported. The envoy sent to London to argue for Pinochet's release, \\nSantiago Benadava, would offer only diplomatic advice, said Chilean \\nForeign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. Any legal defense would be up \\nto Pinochet's family. Pinochet's son, Augusto, said the family would \\nhire ``the best legal team available in London.'' Several right-wing \\nChilean politicians, including some who held posts in the Pinochet \\nregime, also were flying to London to show their support to their \\nformer boss. Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday \\nto formally apply for extradition. The final decision lies with British \\nHome Secretary Jack Straw. There was no immediate word on when Pinochet \\nwould be questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of \\nanonymity, said questioning was not expected for a week or two. Pinochet \\nhas been widely accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances \\nand deaths of political opponents. His arrest was prompted by applications \\nlast week to question him by two Spanish judges investigating human \\nrights violations. One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also wants to question \\nPinochet about the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina. \\nThe arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about allegations \\nthat he killed Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and 1983. In Chile, \\nseven Spaniards have been identified as missing or dead under the \\nPinochet regime, including two Catholic priests and a U.N. official. \\nAccording to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299 political \\nopponents died or disappeared during Pinochet's term. Pinochet, commander-in-chief \\nof the Chilean army until March, has immunity from prosecution in \\nChile as a senator-for-life under a new constitution that his government \\ncrafted. He is also covered under an amnesty for crimes committed \\nbefore 1978 _ when most of the human rights abuses took place. \\n\\nThe British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate \\nof former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of \\ntheir judicial authorities and they will not interfere. ``Both myself \\nand Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to discuss,'' British \\nPrime Minister Tony Blair said, referring to Spanish leader Jose Maria \\nAznar. ``I've avoided commenting on that judicial process and I don't \\nintend to do so.'' Aznar made similar comments when he meet journalists \\non the margin of a European Union summit in this Alpine lakeside resort. \\nPinochet is under arrest in a London hospital where he'd gone for \\nback surgery. He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate \\nseeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture \\nduring his 1973-90 rule. The Chilean government has urged Britain \\nto release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a \\nsenator, he is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Aznar dismissed reports \\nthat the bid to try Pinochet will damage Spain's relations with Latin \\nAmerica. ``It's important we don't talk nonsense about this issue. \\nThis is stupid.'' \\n\", \"\\nA fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween \\nrevelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring \\nabout 180. The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the two-story \\nbuilding and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue \\nservice leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.'' Although \\nan estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on \\nthe upper floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity \\nof 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the disaster investigation. \\nThe fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant \\ngroup, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when \\n20 people died in the town of Boraas. On Friday, police said most \\nvictims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were \\nfound at the scene, and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials \\nsaid. The injured included about 20 in serious condition. The dance \\napparently was attended mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants. \\nPolice said the list of injured included Somalis and people from current \\nand former Yugoslavia. The Macedonian Association had rented the facility \\nout for the dance, Carlsson said. That person was not immediately \\nidentified. Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when \\nhe saw the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several \\npeople, including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin \\nwas red and bubbly,'' Atta said. ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' \\nhe added at Hammarkullen Lutheran Church, where several dozen family \\nand friends of victims gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows \\nwho just jumped. They didn't even look down'' beforehand. Fire officials \\nwere alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck \\nat the scene four minutes later, rescue workers said. The blaze was \\nalready consuming the brick building. About 300 or 400 people were \\ninside, police said. Many escaped on their own. Police rescued 40. \\nThe Swedish news agency TT said the association had permission to \\nhave only 150 people in the facility. The building had just two exits, \\none of which was blocked by fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg \\nwas quoted as saying by TT. ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman \\nBengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and \\nother youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends. \\nThe cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know is \\nthat there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.

Seven of the most severely \\ninjured were taken by helicopter to burn clinics in other cities, \\nthe report said. Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest \\nof the capital, Stockholm. The dance was filled with teen-agers celebrating \\nHalloween and a holiday weekend. ``A night full of expectation, happiness \\nover extra leave from school and high spirits in anticipation of a \\nweekend was brutally and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible \\ndimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement. ``Goteborg \\nis today a city in shock.'' Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited \\nthe fire site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement \\nof condolence. Jamal Fawz, graf 19 pvs \\n\\nA panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities \\ngot of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, \\ndelaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured \\n162, officials said Saturday. Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency \\nservices line said the call was so hard to understand that it took \\nthree minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where \\nto send fire trucks. The first fire trucks and rescue squads were \\non the scene six minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said \\nat a news conference. He and other officials declined to comment on \\nwhether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant \\nvictims. The minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the \\nterror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they \\nsaw as a slow and even obstructive response. ''No help. No police. \\nNo firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one of the disc jockeys at \\nthe bash, said Friday, hours after the blaze exploded. ''Just kids \\nhelping kids.'' And once the squads arrived, the kids were blocked \\nfrom helping, they say. ''We could have saved more young people if \\nonly police hadn't stopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying \\nby the newspaper Expressen. On Saturday, hundreds of people stood \\nquietly outside the gutted building amid flowers and candles as they \\nattempted to come to grips with catastrophe. In the parking lot that \\na day before had been a tumult of ambulances and screams, mourners \\nhad laid a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles \\nand cards of remembrance. The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I \\nwill see you in heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood \\nreading them also had few words. ``I just wanted to show my sympathy. \\nI think about them. There's nothing else we can do,'' said Caroline \\nEricsson, who didn't know any of the victims. For Lasse Gustavsson, \\nhaving the right words wasn't as important as showing his face, severely \\ndisfigured in a fire. The former Goteborg firefighter lost his ears, \\nhis eyelids and most of his nose in a gas explosion. By showing up, \\nhe said, he wanted to show the victims' relatives and friends that \\nspirit can help them pull through despair. ``I can't give them hope. \\nConsolation is enough,'' he said, as people nearby cast uneasy glances \\nat his scars. Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure \\nsimilar shocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say the \\nexplosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowded hall \\nto 600 degrees (1,100 F). The cause of the fire that broke out just \\nbefore midnight Thursday remains under investigation. Witness accounts \\nhave varied widely, with some reporting smoke coming from the cellar \\nand others saying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the \\ndance hall on the building's second floor. The fire's quick spread \\nhas prompted speculation that it could have been set, but officials \\nalso say the explosive spread could have been because the fire had \\nbeen burning undetected for some time. What's known is that the hall \\nwas packed far beyond its capacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of \\n150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the \\nfire hit. The crowd was mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrants or \\nchildren of immigrant parents. They had come for a dance organized \\nby eight party-arrangers whom police have not identified; the hall \\nwas rented by the organizers from the local Macedonian immigrant association. \\nOfficials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities, including \\nSomalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people \\nfrom the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American \\ncountries. Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing \\nrelatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait for hours \\nat hospitals. Only 18 of the dead had been identified by midday Saturday. \\n``The identification is hard because they have no driver's licenses \\nor other documents _ they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson \\nof Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 residents \\nabout 300 miles (500 kilometers) west of Stockholm. The worst previous \\nSwedish fire disaster in modern history was in 1978 in Boraas, when \\n20 people died in a hotel fire. \\n\\nA fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween \\nrevelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring \\nabout 180. ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local \\nrescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing \\nthe sight when rescuers first entered the building in Goteborg, a \\ncity of half a million people on the country's west coast. The fire \\nwas the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people \\ndied in the town of Boraas. ``We are still searching the building \\n... but so far we have found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan \\nEdmundson said on national radio. At a news conference Friday morning, \\npolice said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases. \\nThe injured toll was lowered slightly to 180, but included seven people \\nwho needed treatment at emergency burn centers. Binan Atta was walking \\nto the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire. He said he raced \\nin and pulled to safety several people, including a friend. ``His \\nclothes had burned off. His skin was red and bubbly,'' Atta said. \\n``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran \\nChurch, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered. \\n``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They didn't even \\nlook down'' beforehand. Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. \\n(2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes \\nlater, rescue workers said. The blaze was already consuming the two-story \\nbrick building. The dance was on the second floor. About 300 or 400 \\npeople were inside, police said. Many escaped on their own. Police \\nrescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies. The 60th victim died at a hospital. \\n``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with \\nyouths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling \\nwith police to get in and attempt to help friends. The cause of the \\nfire was not immediately known. ``What we know is that there was an \\nexplosion,'' Edmundson said. Olin said there were signs that the fire \\nwas set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not \\na normal fire,'' he said. The Swedish news agency TT reported 190 \\npeople were taken to hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in \\nintensive care. Seven of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter \\nto burn clinics in other cities, the report said. Goteborg is about \\n500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm. The \\nfire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in building of the \\nlocal Macedonian Association, which organized the dance. The crowd \\nin the second story of the building contained mostly 13 to 18 year \\nolds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend. ``A night full of \\nexpectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirits \\nin anticipation of a weekend was brutally and suddenly changed into \\na tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council \\nsaid in a statement. ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.'' Jamal \\nFawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze \\nstarted with about 400 people inside. ``It looked like it started \\nin the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he \\nwas quoted as saying. ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get \\nout and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... \\nOthers kicked out the windows and jumped out.'' Ambulances were called \\nin from several nearby communities. The Goteborg rescue services also \\nbrought city buses into service to help transport the injured. Olin \\nsaid the rescue service inspected the building in April 1997 and ``fulfilled \\nall possible demands as far as emergency exits and the possibility \\nfor fast evacuation.'' Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, \\nwhere many of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them \\nwas difficult. ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they \\nare ... They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that \\nof a friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification \\non them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,'' \\nshe said, according to TT. Goteborg has about 435,000 people. \\n\\nForensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able Saturday \\nto identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, \\nbut the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered. \\nHow could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a hall \\npacked far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing \\npanicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap \\nout of second-story windows? ''As long as the technicians haven't \\nestablished the cause of the fire, we don't know if it's arson or \\nnot,'' Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening. \\nEarlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ''50-50'' chance that \\nthe fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that authorities had \\ntracked down new clues. But Noren later retracted the remark, saying \\nhe'd meant only that no possibilities were being excluded. As investigators \\nworked to find the cause, examiners identified another 22 of the bodies, \\nbringing the total to 40, and officials said 49 people were released \\nfrom hospital. Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in \\nthe Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victims \\nwere immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including \\nIraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia. The \\nfirst call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented \\nSwedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress, delayed \\nthe fire squads' response by several minutes. Per-Olof Ortarsen of \\nGoteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand \\nthat it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going \\non and where to send fire trucks. The first fire trucks and rescue \\nsquads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received, \\nOrtarsen told a news conference.

''It's \\ndamn difficult,'' said Connie Mesfin, who said she lost a friend in \\nthe blaze. Lasse Gustafsson, a former Goteborg firefighter severely \\ndisfigured in an explosion, also came to the club site to try to show \\nthe victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help them pull \\nthrough despair. ``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' \\nhe said, as people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars. Many of \\nthose injured in the blaze may have to endure similar shocked looks \\nthe rest of their lives. Authorities say the explosive fire quickly \\nraised the temperature in the hall to 600 degrees (1,100 F). The hall \\nwas packed far beyond its capacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of \\n150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the \\nfire hit. One of the two exit stairways was blocked by fire and there \\nwere conflicting statements from witnesses as to whether the fire \\ncame up the stairs from a lower level, or whether it spread there \\nafter breaking out in the second-floor rooms. The worst previous fire \\ndisaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died \\nin a hotel fire. Goteborg, Sweden's second-largest city with about \\n435,000 people, is 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm. \\n\\nA fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers \\ninto a deathtrap, killing 65 people and injuring 157 others in Sweden's \\nsecond-largest city. The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a \\nfew minutes before midnight Thursday gutted the building and left \\nrescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart \\nOlin likened to a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been \\ndetermined as of Friday evening. Although an estimated 400 people, \\nmost aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, \\nthe facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans \\nCarlsson, the detective leading the disaster investigation.

Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 \\nof them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick \\ntwo-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a boisterous \\ndisco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moments. Bent metal \\nbars on some of the hall's windows showed the panic-fueled strength \\nthat the teen-agers, many of them immigrants, exerted as they sought \\nways out of the hall, which with some 400 people inside was crowded \\nto more than twice its legal capacity. Below the second-floor windows \\nlay stray shoes, broken glass and bloody blankets used to wrap those \\nwho may or may not have lived. ``I've been crying all day. I haven't \\nbeen able to sleep. I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends \\nare dead,'' 17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined \\nbuilding Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and \\ntwo male friends of hers died. Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey \\nat the bash, told of his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. ``Panic. No \\nhelp. No police. No firemen. Only kids helping each other,'' he said \\nfrom his bed in a Goteborg hospital. Although Hersi, like many of \\nthe youths at the dance, believes the police and firemen were slow, \\nauthorities said the first fire trucks were on the scene within five \\nminutes of getting the alarm. But the fire spread so fast that even \\nan instant response would likely have been too slow. The cause of \\nthe fire had not been determined as of Friday evening. Fire Brigade \\nEngineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames' quick, raging spread could \\nindicate arson, or that the fire had burned undetected for a time \\nbefore exploding. The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, \\nwhere the dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant \\nassociation in Sweden's second-largest city. The association had hired \\nout the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, police said but \\ndeclined to identify the arrangers. The crowd was mostly aged 13 to \\n18, witnesses said, and consisted mostly of immigrants or children \\nof immigrant parents. Officials said the dead and injured were of \\n19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians \\nand Swedes, as well as people from the current and former Yugoslavia \\nand unspecified Latin American countries. Identifying the dead was \\na wrackingly slow process, forcing relatives and friends exhausted \\nwith dread to wait for hours at hospitals. Some were able to make \\nthe wait in rooms off-limits to journalists, but many had to wait \\nin corridors, crying and teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they \\nlooked for their pals. Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday \\nevening. ``The identification is hard not only because of the burns \\nbut also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents \\n_ they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, \\nthe largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers (300 miles) \\nwest of Stockholm. The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's \\nmodern history, shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness. \\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement \\nreassuring victims' relatives that ``all of us in Sweden feel great \\nsympathy.'' Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm \\nto the fire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the \\ngutted wreck. ``The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind \\nof boots my own children wear,'' he said. On Friday evening, about \\n1,500 mostly young people, came to the Goteborg Cathedral to try to \\nassuage their grief and bewilderment at a memorial service. The youths \\nwere dressed in the same sort of hip-hop garb that the dance-goers \\nhad worn, but listened to delicate hymns instead of pounding disco. \\nThey wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously, apparently \\nnot knowing how to behave in a church. ``I don't go to church. I'm \\na Muslim, but I don't go to prayers,'' said a young man who gave his \\nname only as Sami. ``I'm accompanying my Christian friends. We lost \\nsomeone. We're mourning _ that's all.'' \\n\", \"\\nCongolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President \\nLaurent Kabila to the Internet. ``We have to explain to the world \\naudience who we are and what we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest \\nWamba dia Wamba said on Friday. ``Besides, the (Kabila) government \\nhas been using the Internet to tell their side of the story.'' The \\n56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar es Salaam in \\nTanzania said supporters of the Congolese Rally for Democracy in the \\nUnited States have created a web site for the rebellion. The site \\n_ www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm _ has been set up on the donor-supported \\nPrairenet Community Network in eastern Illinois. The rebels are a \\ncoalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army \\nand political opponents who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, \\ncorruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes. After an initial \\nlightning advance in the far west of Africa's third-largest nation, \\nthe rebels were stopped at the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, \\nby troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila. \\nSince then, the rebels have been confined to a chunk of territory \\nin the extreme eastern part of the country where their rebellion was \\ndeclared Aug. 2. Wamba said the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, \\nan area of 15 million people. So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate \\nwith the rebels, accusing them of being the puppets of neighboring \\nRwanda and Uganda. Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet \\nis just part of the media campaign. Last week, Wamba dispatched two \\nof his top aides to the United States and Europe to lobby for political \\nsupport and raise public awareness about the conflict in Congo. ``World \\nleaders, diplomats and are not familiar enough with our cause. They \\nstill talk about Tutsis leading the rebellion. Well, I'm not a Tutsi,'' \\nWamba said. Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a \\nformer lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, met in \\nWashington earlier this week with the U.S. special envoy in the Great \\nLakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with congressmen, \\nWamba said. \\n\\nA day after shooting down a jetliner carrying 40 people, rebels clashed \\nwith government troops near a strategic airstrip in eastern Congo \\non Sunday. Fighting for the town of Kindu in this vast West African \\nnation subsided after rebels launched an artillery barrage into government-held \\nbuildings and the airfield, two miles (three kilometers) away. On \\nSaturday, the rebels shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu \\nairport. Rescue workers said there were no survivors from the downed \\nplane, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Sunday. Rebels said \\nthe airplane was carrying 40 troops and ammunition. In the capital, \\nKinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which owned the aircraft, \\nsaid the victims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. It was \\nnot possible to confirm either claim independently. Rebel commander \\nFino Kabangu Kalunga said surface-to-air missiles in the arsenal of \\nhis Congolese Democratic Coalition had prevented the government from \\nlanding aircraft at the airport. Kabangu Kalunga said 3,500 rebel \\ntroops and their Rwandan allies had closed in on government forces \\nfrom three directions after a week of fighting. He said government \\ntroops did not launch a counterattack to Sunday's barrage, and some \\nreportedly retreated on the one road leading out of town. The rebels \\nsay they now control one-third of Kindu, which the government has \\nused as a staging area for a counteroffensive against rebel positions \\nin the east. Rebels, who began their insurgency more than two months \\nago, accuse President Laurent Kabila of corruption, failing to carry \\nout promised democratic reforms, and stirring up hatred among Congo's \\n400 tribes. Early in the conflict, rebels pushed far into the west, \\nto the outskirts of Congo's capital. Then Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia \\nintervened to help Kabila and drove the rebels back to their bases \\nin eastern Congo. The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors. \\nThere are unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan \\nare involved in defending Kindu. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda \\n_ former allies who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month \\nrebellion _ of sponsoring the rebels. Both countries say they have \\nlegitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of \\nfailing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. \\n\\nRebels attacked a village in western Uganda and killed six civilians \\nbefore soldiers drove them off, a military spokesman said Thursday. \\nThe attack occurred overnight Wednesday in the village of Chiondo \\nnear Kasese, 270 kilometers (170 miles) west of the capital Kampala, \\nsaid the spokesman, who identified himself only as Lt. Majera. Majera \\nsaid the attackers were believed to be rebels of the Allied Democratic \\nForces who operate from bases in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains \\nthat straddle the Uganda-Congolese border. He said the rebels likely \\nfled back to their bases after the attack. Majera said the attackers \\navoided a nearby army post when they shot up the village. It was the \\ngunfire that alerted the soldiers, he said, adding that they killed \\ntwo of the assailants. The various rebel groups operating in the region \\noften attack with knives or machetes, either to save on ammunition \\nor because they don't have guns. He had no further details. Under \\nan agreement earlier this year with Congo, Uganda sent troops into \\nthe neighboring country to flush out the ADF fighters. President Yoweri \\nMuseveni insists they will remain there until Ugandan security is \\nguaranteed, despite Congolese President Laurent Kabila's protests \\nthat Uganda is backing Congolese rebels attempting to topple him. \\nThe anti-Kabila rebels claim the Ugandan rebel Lord's Resistance Army, \\nwhich operates in northern Uganda and enjoys support from Sudan, is \\nfighting alongside Kabila's forces together with Sudanese soldiers. \\nThe government-owned daily New Vision reported Thursday that LRA leader \\nJoseph Kony was badly wounded last week and is in hospital in Juba, \\nthe largest town still under government control in southern Sudan. \\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is fighting the government \\nin Khartoum for autonomy for southern Sudan, has waged pitched battles \\nwith government troops in the past week as it moves on Juba, spokesmen \\nfor both sides say. New Vision quoted Ugandan Minister of State for \\nSecurity Muruli Mukasa as saying Kony's largest camp at al-Gabelain, \\n38 kilometers (24 miles) south of Juba, was destroyed last week when \\nthe SPLA took control. Muruli said the LRA had been planning to bomb \\nseveral sites in the Ugandan capital, including the Parliament building, \\nstate-run Radio Uganda, unidentified embassies and other public sites, \\nthe newspaper said. \\n\\nBack in the golden years, Kasuku wa Ngeyo had a farm and was the head \\nof a 25,000-strong farmers organization in the northeastern breadbasket \\nof this central African nation. A quarter of a century later, the \\n56-year-old businessman who also ran hotels and a tourist camp is \\nbroke; the farmers group is a memory. Inter-tribal rivalry, looting \\nsoldiers, Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have \\nwiped out half a million head of cattle here, slashed coffee and tea \\nexports in half and turned Congo's bucolic eastern region of green \\npastures, sparkling volcanic lakes and snow-capped mountains into \\na war zone. ``Nobody is making money any more. People are surviving \\non a sack of beans. They are tired of insecurity and have little hope \\nthings will get better,'' said Kasuku, the son of an Italian settler \\nand a Rwandan Tutsi refugee mother. On Aug. 2, Tutsis, political opponents, \\nand disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army took up \\narms, accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism and fostering tribal \\nstrife. The war has split Africa's third-largest nation between the \\ngovernment-held west and south and rebel-controlled east, and no political \\nsettlement is in sight. Goma, a small trading post at the head of \\nLake Kivu in eastern Congo, is no longer the starting point for tourists \\ntrekking to see mountain gorillas. Today, its decaying buildings, \\nempty shops and crumbling guest houses are home to rebel leaders, \\nsoldiers and people displaced by violence. The rebels have promised \\nto revitalize the economy by reducing taxes to boost investment. They \\nalso say they will pay civil servants _ who haven't seen a paycheck \\nin months or years _ and invite investors to buy tea and coffee farms \\nand gold and diamond-mining concessions. But the war has also increased \\ntribal animosity _ especially toward ethnic Tutsis, a tiny but highly \\nsuccessful minority in the eastern region. In 1990, the liberating \\neffect of early political freedoms revived unresolved land disputes \\nand led to clashes between the Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus _ who had \\nsettled in eastern Congo since the 1930s. Mai-Mai warriors _ armed \\nyouths from the Hunde and Nande tribes who accuse Tutsis of stealing \\ntheir land, also joined the fighting. In 1994, nearly 1 million Rwandan \\nrefugees engulfed Goma, a town of 30,000. Among them were former Hutu \\nsoldiers and militiamen who took part in a 1994 genocide in neighboring \\nRwanda in which more than half a million Tutsis were killed. They \\nbrought anti-Tutsi ideology with them and sold weapons to Congolese \\ntribes, who then joined in the persecution of Tutsi landowners and \\nranchers. ``People misunderstood political freedoms for anarchy,'' \\nsaid Safari Ngezayo, a farmer and hotel owner. ``We tried to mediate \\nbetween Tutsis and Hutus and other tribes, but how can you talk to \\npeople who have blood on their hands and genocide in their heads?'' \\nIn late 1996, Congolese Tutsis backed by Rwanda attacked the refugee \\ncamps, dislodged the Hutu fighters and forced most of the refugees \\nback home across the border. After an eight-month rebellion backed \\nby Rwanda and Uganda, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled in May 1997, \\nand Kabila took power. He quickly changed the name of the country \\nto Congo, from Zaire. Few people in northeastern Congo expected another \\nrebellion so soon. ``I blame our politicians. Then I blame the foreign \\npowers who kept meddling in our affairs. It is they who supported \\nMobutu and Kabila, and we are paying the interest,'' Kasuku said. \\n\\nAfter a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered \\nKindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the \\ngovernment to halt their advances. Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, \\nsaid the rebel fighters were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, \\nlarge airbase, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel \\nstronghold. ``We're in the town and the airport,'' Ngangura said. \\nHe offered no details and the report could not be confirmed independently. \\nRebel military sources said the fighting continued inside Kindu where \\nthe rebels were apparently meeting stiff resistance. The rebels _ \\nethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's \\narmy and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2 accusing Kabila \\nof mismanagement, corruption and creating division among Congo's 400 \\ntribes. The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they \\nwere forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, \\nafter troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila's aid. Troops \\nmoving south from Kisangani, the largest city under rebel control, \\nand moving west, had made steady gains against Kindu, which the government \\napparently used to build up force for a planned counter-offensive. \\nApart from Kindu, Ngangura said rebel fighters took Buta, 120 kilometers \\n(75 miles) north of Kisangani and on the main road in northern Congo \\nthat links Sudan and the Central African Republic. Also on Sunday, \\nNgangura said the rebels took Bumba, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest \\nof Kisangani. These reports could not be confirmed independently either. \\nRebel leaders said a victory at Kindu would confirm rebel strength, \\nboost fighters' morale and perhaps persuade others to join them. The \\nrebels want direct negotiations with Kabila. But the president has \\nso far refused, accusing the rebels of being puppets of Rwanda and \\nUganda, which Kabila has accused of orchestrating the rebellion. The \\nconflict in Central Africa has drawn in most of Congo's nine neighbors, \\nand regional diplomatic initiatives have so far failed to stop it. \\n\\nRebel commanders said Tuesday they were poised to overrun an important \\ngovernment-held air base in eastern Congo _ a battle that could determine \\nthe future of the two-month Congolese war. After trekking several \\nhundred kilometers (miles) through dense tropical forest, thousands \\nof rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, \\nwhere troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base \\nas a launching pad for offensives. If the rebels succeed in capturing \\nKindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, \\nthis will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and \\npave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest. A \\nrebel defeat, on the other hand, would put the coalition of ethnic \\nTutsis, disenchanted members of the Congolese army and opposition \\npoliticians on the defensive and give a boost to Kabila's efforts \\nto fend off the rebellion launched Aug. 2. Rebel commander Richard \\nMondo said troops had fired artillery rounds into Kindu Monday and \\nearly Tuesday, sending the population fleeing out of town. Advance \\nunits had crossed the Lualaba River from the north and were meeting \\nstiff resistance in the town, he said. Since the assault on the town \\nbegan at 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), at least 18 enemy soldiers were killed \\nand 40 taken prisoner, Mondo said, adding the number was expected \\nto rise. The rebels took casualties, too, but the number was not known. \\nOne rebel soldier was wounded in the stomach, he said. He said the \\nlarge Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) outside town, was deserted \\nand no one appeared to be in control. ``Our soldiers are in the town \\nand the fighting is continuing,'' rebel battalion commander Arthur \\nMulunda said in Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu. \\nThere was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims. On Sunday, \\na spokesman in Goma boasted that Kindu was already under rebel control. \\nIn Kinshasa, government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Monday the Congolese \\narmy was firmly in control of Kindu. Mulunda's 1,500-strong battalion \\nwalked 240 kilometers (150 miles) Bukavu at the southern end of Lake \\nKivu to Kalima, which fell to the rebels Saturday with little resistance. \\nThe rebel fighters, clad in brand-new Rwandan-made dark green uniforms, \\nrubber rain boots and toting Kalashnikov assault rifles and rocket-propelled \\ngrenade launchers, said they were advancing slowly through the lush \\nforest of palm trees and razor-sharp tall grass. ``We've been resting \\na lot. It took us two weeks to get here,'' Mondo said. The rebels \\nare now using Kalima, a town with one main street, scattered houses \\nand mud-and-brick huts, to supply troops with rice, cooking oil, drinking \\nwater and ammunition. A small, grass airstrip 8 kilometers (5 miles) \\naway from Kalima is just barely long enough for the rebels' Russian-built \\nAntonov AN-72 transport aircraft. The rebels have targeted Kindu since \\nlate August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of \\nKinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila. \\nRebels still control a string of towns in eastern Congo, including \\nKisangani, the country's third-largest city. \\n\\nThe bloody bandages of injured rebels trucked back to this rear base \\nWednesday offered evidence that the three-day battle for the strategic \\nair base at Kindu was not going well for those fighting to oust Congolese \\nPresident Laurent Kabila. It was impossible to say who had the upper \\nhand in the battle for Kindu and its air base, which government forces \\nhave been using to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble \\nground troops. Rebel commander Richard Mondo said shelling and ground \\nattacks, which began Monday, continued on Wednesday. Mondo said he \\nwas expecting air shipments of munitions to bolster the rebel offensive. \\nOn Wednesday, a truck unloaded a dozen wounded rebel fighters at Kalima, \\na small town 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu, serving \\nas a rear base for the attack. Sweaty and weary, some limping and \\nothers bandaged, they waited to be airlifted to a hospital in Goma, \\nthe rebel stronghold 380 kilometers (235 miles) east, on the Rwandan \\nborder. The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers \\nin Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ faced stiff resistance. \\nIn Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that the Congolese \\nArmed Forces, known as the FAC, had killed 18 rebels in warding off \\nthe attacks. ``Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC, which \\nhas now launched an offensive after defending its positions,'' said \\na ministry statement broadcast on state-run television. ``The civilians \\nthere are cooperating fully with the FAC as their counterparts did \\npreviously in Kinshasa,'' the capital. Rebel leaders hope the capture \\nof Kindu will boost morale and demonstrate can carry their two-month \\nrebellion into the rest of Congo, Africa's third-largest nation. The \\nrebel victory would also open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai \\nprovinces, rich in copper and diamonds. The rebels targeted Kindu \\nsince late August, when they were forced to retreat their march from \\nextreme western Congo to the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and \\nZimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila. Rebel commanders say their \\n2,000 fighters face an estimated 5,000 government troops, apparently \\nreinforced by Sudanese soldiers. Sudan denies involvement in Congo. \\nThe rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion that \\nbrought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and creating \\ndivisions among Congo's 400 tribes. \\n\\nRebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said they shot down a passenger \\njet ferrying 40 government soldiers into a strategic airport facing \\na rebel assault. A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were \\ncivilians being evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 \\nmiles) east of the capital, Kinshasa. Neither claim could be confirmed \\nindependently. Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's \\nmanagement committee, said a missile hit the rear engine of the Boeing \\njet after the aircraft took off from Kindu airport. A rebel military \\ncommander, who requested anonymity, said the plane was carrying troops, \\nalthough he did not explain how he knew this. He said the plane was \\nshot down while approaching Kindu air base, where the rebels had deployed \\nat least two surface-to-air missiles and more than 3,500 troops in \\npreparation for a final assault on the government-held town. Alexis \\nTambwe Mwamba, one of rebel leaders, said from the rebel stronghold \\nat Goma, 380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kalima, that fighters \\nhad intercepted government radio messages in Kindu and knew in advance \\nof the arrival of the aircraft. He said the government had been using \\nthe Boeing 727 to fly in troops and ammunition in Kindu for several \\ndays. Papaioannou, citing, 6th graf pvs \\n\\nCongolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President \\nLaurent Kabila to the Internet. ``We have to explain to the world \\naudience who we are and what we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest \\nWamba dia Wamba said on Friday. ``Besides, the (Kabila) government \\nhas been using the Internet to tell their side of the story.''

Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government \\nforces, surrounded by 3,500 rebel troops from three directions, failed \\nto respond to Sunday's attacks. Some troops reportedly retreated through \\na single road corridor leading out of the town. On Saturday, the rebels \\nsaid they shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 which was attempting to \\nland at Kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition. In Kinshasa, \\nthe private Congolese Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the \\nvictims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. It was not possible \\nto confirm independently either claim. Kalunga said the airport, although \\nstill under government control, was in effect unoperational because \\nof the rebel surface-to-air-missiles deployed nearby. War-weary, physically \\nexhausted and sweaty, hundreds of rebel troops and Rwandan soldiers \\nmarched through dense tropical forest went to reinforce their comrades \\nat Kindu. After a week of battling for Kindu, rebel fighters had made \\nlittle progress and failed to capture the town outright. The rebels \\nsee Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt against President \\nLaurent Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and \\nwarmongering among Congo's 400 tribes. Kabila has turned Kindu into \\na launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in \\neastern Congo. The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors. \\nThere are unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan \\nare involved in defending Kindu. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda \\n_ former allies who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month \\nrebellion _ of sponsoring the new fighting. Both countries say they \\nhave legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila \\nof failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. \\nTanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting \\nKabila. The assistance was essential in routing an early rebel offensive \\nin the west that had reached the outskirts of Kinshasa in mid-August. \\nThe rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu and are poised \\nto overrun the rest of the town. Under a scorching sun, the column \\nof rebel reinforcements heading to Kindu sneaked through abandoned \\nroadside hamlets. The silence of their march was interrupted only \\nby the singing of crickets and the clanging of the bullet belts hanging \\naround the soldiers' necks. Soldiers walked by empty huts made of \\nmud and palm leaves. Some rested in the shade of the umbrella-shaped \\nacacia trees. The soldiers stopped for the night at the bridge over \\nthe chocolate-colored Elila River, which guards the path to Kindu. \\nThere was no immediate comment on the latest developments from the \\ngovernment in Kinshasa, which claimed earlier in the week it was in \\ncontrol of the tarmac bridge. \\n\", \"\\nA major search was under way in Bass Strait off Australia's southeast \\ncoast on Sunday night for an injured crewman swept overboard during \\nthe Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority \\n(AMSA) said it had alerted all shipping in the Strait as high winds \\nand huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. The Australian \\nNavy has sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking \\nequipment to search the area and may send the frigate HMAS Newcastle \\ninto the area Monday morning morning from Sydney. An AMSA spokesman \\nsaid they were alerted that the 13-meter Sydney yacht Sword of Orion \\nhad been rolled in the heavy seas, with several crewmen being injured, \\nincluding the unidentified man lost overboard. Another crewman has \\na broken leg. The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across \\nBass Strait heading towards Hobart, capital of the island state of \\nTasmania and the finish line in the annual race. The ANSA spokesman \\nsaid search conditions were ``atrocious.'' Earlier, as winds gusting \\nto 80 knots and seas of 35 feet caused havoc to the fleet, several \\nrescues took place. A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept \\noverboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge \\nseas 19 nautical miles south of Gabo Island. John Campbell, an American, \\nwas in the water for about 40 minutes and was suffering from hypothermia \\nwhen he was winched to safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who \\ndropped into 20-foot seas to secure Campbell. The Victorian state \\npolice Air Wing used an infra-red night vision system to find Campbell \\nand the Navy Sea King is using the same equipment to try to find the \\nman lost from Sword of Orion. Another helicopter lifted the entire \\ncrew of 12 from the dismasted VC Offshore Stand Aside. Several crew \\nmembers were injured in the dismasting, with one losing several fingers \\nand another suffering head injuries. A total of 37 yachts have been \\nforced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many having been \\ndismasted or suffering injuries to crew. Meanwhile, American maxi \\nSayonara is narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella. \\nAlthough the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were \\nstill well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile race of \\n2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by German maxi \\nMorning Glory in 1996. (djp) \\n\\nTwo sailors died and 15 others were missing after gale-force winds \\nand high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday. \\n``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is tragedy \\nbecause in the 54-year history of the race I think there's only two \\npeople who have died in it before,'' said Australian Maritime Safety \\nAuthority spokesman David Gray. The two dead were found on the 40-foot \\nvessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the \\nNew South Wales state town of Merimbula. Gray said Business Post Naiad \\nowner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs \\nwere killed. Both men were from Launceston in northern Tasmania. Guy \\nsuffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the yacht \\nrolled, Gray said, while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free \\nhimself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the \\nboat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as possible. \\nRace officials said Guy sailed in two previous Sydney to Hobart yacht \\nraces. Grave fears were held for the safety of the nine crew on missing \\ncutter Winston Churchill, while contact has been lost with the five \\ncrew aboard Solo Globe. British sailor Glyn Charles was swept off \\nthe Sword of Orion on Sunday night when the boat rolled in wild seas. \\nAt 12:30 p.m. local time (0130 GMT) Monday Charles had been missing \\nfor about 17 hours. Race officials said Charles had sailed in four \\nAdmiral's Cups and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 \\nAtlanta Olympics where he finished 11th. Race spokesman Peter Campbell \\nsaid it was not known how long Gray could survive in the water. ``It's \\nsupposition,'' Campbell said. ``We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 \\nhours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in very severe \\nconditions.'' Gray said about 56 sailors had been winched to safety. \\n``There's just many many injuries on those yachts that got knocked \\ndown. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,'' Gray said. \\n``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got pounded \\nyesterday.'' One of the missing yachts _ B-52 _ was found mid-morning \\nMonday and was making its way towards Eden on the New South Wales \\ncoast. The nine crew on board were thought to be safe and the vessel \\nwas sailing unassisted. American John Campbell was rescued by a police \\nhelicopter after being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over \\n35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island. Campbell was in the \\nwater for about 40 minutes and had hypothermia when he was taken to \\nsafety by Senior Constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swells \\nto secure Campbell. ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United \\nStates television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I \\nwas going to survive.'' ``(Barclay) came down into the water only \\nabout 5, 10 feet away from me and I swam to him pretty quicky. I just \\nthrew my arms into the harness and they hoisted me up.'' At least \\n37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. \\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority alerted all shipping in Bass \\nStrait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the \\n115-boat fleet. The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last \\nyear's winner, Brindabella. Although the two were forced to reduce \\nsail and cut speed, they were still well inside the race record of \\n2 days, 14 hours, 7 minutes, 10 seconds, set by German maxi Morning \\nGlory in 1996. \\n\\nUnited States maxi Sayonara looks set to continue the foreign domination \\nof line honors in Australia's famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, \\nwhich starts Saturday. Sayonara, raced by American computer billionaire \\nLarry Ellison, has only been beaten once since it was launched in \\n1995 and is aiming for its second win in the 630 nautical mile bluewater \\nclassic. If the 80-footer beats the local boats home into Hobart, \\nit will be third time in four years a foreign yacht has finished first. \\nNew Zealand Endeavour trumped the locals in 1992, Sayonara won in \\n1995 and German's Morning Glory set a race record of two days, 14 \\nhours, seven minutes and 10 seconds the following year. Sayonara's \\nrivals are expected to be last year's line honors winner Brindabella \\nof Sydney and new Australian maxi Wild Thing. The contest for handicap \\nhonors appears more open, but there are many who believe Sayonara \\ncould become the sixth yacht to do the line honors and handicap double. \\nEllison believes unforeseen damage is the only major barrier to victory. \\n``She is a much more modern boat than Brindabella, if we don't break, \\nwe should beat Brindabella, we should beat anybody,'' Ellison said. \\n``If we hold together we should win the race, the question is if this \\nboat comes through and pays us a favor we would just love to knock \\noff the record.'' Ellison says Sayonara can knock half a day off Morning \\nGlory's record given the right conditions. Brindabella's captain and \\nowner George Snow believes a new record is possible. ``I think the \\nfront boats will be very close all the way down, which will be a great \\nchallenge,'' said Snow. ``We are well set up, we've got the best crew \\nwe've ever had and I think the boat is in great shape,'' Snow added. \\nThe race is tipped to start Saturday under freshening north easters \\nwith the prospect of showers and a thunder storm before a southerly \\nchange of around 25-30 knots later in the day. The southerly is expected \\nto ease to 15-20 knots over Sunday before swinging back to the north \\non Monday with a west to south westerly change expected to move through \\nTasmania and Bass Strait on Tuesday when the first yacht is anticipated \\nto finish. \\n\\nBritish sailor Glyn Charles was missing and presumed drowned _ becoming \\nthe third fatality in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while three \\nothers remained missing in rough seas after nightfall Monday. Robin \\nPoke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), \\nadmitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more \\nthan 24 hours at sea after being washed off Sword of Orion on Sunday \\nnight. ``He has been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and 80-kilometer \\n(50-mile) winds,'' Poke said Monday. ``He will be a superman if he \\nmakes it.'' Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented \\nBritain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished \\n11th. Two sailors died after gale-force winds and high seas battered \\nthe entrants. Four members from the veteran cutter Winston Churchill \\nwere winched to safety from a liferaft before dark Monday. Two more \\ncrew from the Winston Churchill were plucked from a second liferaft \\nlate Monday night, but three others who had been aboard the liferaft \\nwere still missing. ``We are unsure about what has happened to the \\nother three, it appears they were washed out of the liferaft,'' a \\nspokesman for the authority said. The two dead, both Australians, \\nwere found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers \\n(60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. The yacht's \\nowner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs \\nwere killed. Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions \\nthe yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself \\nfrom a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the boat but \\nattempts were being made to recover them as soon as possible, rescue \\nofficials said. ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. \\n``He loved the competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after \\nthe race. Dad simply loved life.'' Winston Churchill skipper Richard \\nWinning was one of the four rescued. ``The worst thing of the whole \\naffair was that after we got into the life raft and became separated \\nfrom the others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas \\nat night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said. \\n``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the next \\nthing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent another \\nnight out there.'' The first recorded death in the race, which started \\nin 1945, was in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard \\nfrom Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned. In 1989, a 58-year-old man died \\nfrom head injuries on the yacht Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale \\noff the southern NSW coast snapped the boat's mast. AMSA spokesman \\nDavid Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched to safety in this \\nyear's race. ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that \\ngot knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,'' \\nGray said. ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got \\npounded yesterday.'' American John Campbell was rescued by a police \\nhelicopter after being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over \\n35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island.

A Russian Proton \\nbooster rocket carried the module into its initial orbit 200 kilometers \\n(125 miles) above the Earth and the unit was operating as planned, \\nofficials said. Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone \\nfor two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle \\nEndeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting \\nmodule. Space officials from 16 nations taking part in the project \\ncheered as the rocket soared into the cloudy sky above the central \\nAsian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday _ a year later than \\nplanned. ``During the, pickup 4th pvs \\n\\nWASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set \\naside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space \\nstation into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday. While \\nputting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station \\nwould make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old \\noutpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, \\nsaid Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA was \\nsurprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed \\nthe orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch \\nof the first part of the new station. Delaying the Nov. 20 flight \\nby 10 hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in \\nthe subsequent assembly flights, and resulted in potentially unfavorable \\nsun angles on the solar-powered station, engineers said. ``We have \\nmutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes,'' \\nBrinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center \\nin Houston. ``It added technical complexity and risks to the mission \\nthat were not justified.'' The decision, which followed ``frank and \\ncandid'' discussions between the two partners, was not imposed by \\nthe United States, he said. ``The conclusions were mutual,'' Brinkley \\nsaid. ``Both sides concluded that it did not make sense.'' The Russians, \\nstruggling to find money for their space program with their nation \\nin economic collapse, had said they wanted to transfer thousands of \\npounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an \\neconomy move. However, some critics questioned the Russians' motives, \\nwondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay \\nthe decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have \\nagreed to do next summer. The Russians have so little money that the \\nUnited States and other partners in the international station fear \\nthat money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations \\nwith the new project. ``The Mir competes with the international space \\nstation for very critical resources and for funding,'' Brinkley said. \\nNASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment to \\nuse on the international space station, he said, but only if it does \\nnot interfere with assembling the new station. The United States and \\n15 other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next \\nweek when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and \\npropulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period. \\nThe space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second \\nstation part, a U.S.-built connecting passageway that attaches to \\nthe first module. \\n\\nRussian space experts were making final preparations Thursday at the \\nBaikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion \\ndollar international space station after a year of delay. Built by \\na Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, \\nthe 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded \\ncomponent of the station. It will serve as a space tugboat in the \\nearly stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and communications. \\nThe unmanned launch, set for 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday from \\nBaikonur in Kazakhstan, has been delayed for one year mainly because \\nof the cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure to complete another \\npart of the station. ``After years of discussing, planning and replanning, \\nwe are about to launch hardware,'' Gretchen McClain, deputy associate \\nadministrator for the new station, said at a news conference earlier \\nthis week. ``We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into \\nthe millennium with women and men living and working in space permanently.'' \\nRussian officials added their traditional note of superstition. ``It \\nis not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with ... some \\nadvance statements. I would like to knock on wood, which is rather \\ncommon in the Russian tradition,'' said Alexander Krasnov, a deputy \\nchief of Russian Space Agency's manned flight department. The station, \\ninvolving 16 nations with the United States and Russia playing the \\nbiggest roles, will consist of more than 100 elements that will take \\n45 assembly flights to complete. It is due to be completed by 2004. \\nThe station will weigh 500 tons (more than a million pounds) and is \\nexpected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States \\nplanning to pay dlrs 21 billion. It will serve as an orbital home \\nfor visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for up to 20 years. Zarya is \\nto fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space \\nshuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity \\nconnecting module. The shuttle crew will attach the two modules together \\nin three space walks, using the Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter \\n(41.2-feet) Zarya holds more than 6 tons of fuel in its 16 tanks and \\nis capable of flying independently for 430 days. Its control system \\nconsists of 36 thrusters and two large engines for major orbital changes. \\nIt will be launched by a three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket \\nthat would put Zarya into orbit in less than 10 minutes after the \\nblastoff. In the ensuing days, the ground controllers will gradually \\nadjust its orbit in preparation for the meeting with Endeavor. The \\nspace station will not be inhabitable until early 2000, following \\nthe launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast off next \\nJuly or August. Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for \\nconstructing the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. \\nHaving lost hope of getting the promised government funds, the Russian \\nspace agency has sold its early research time on the station to NASA \\nfor dlrs 60 million to complete the segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev \\nsaid that taking part in the new station is the only hope for the \\nbeleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding has collapsed since \\nthe Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia to keep up to \\n80,000 jobs over the next 15 years. Koptev assailed some Russian space \\nengineers who continue to insist that more money should be put into \\nRussia's own battered 12-year old Mir space station to extend its \\nlifetime instead of committing more funds to the new space outpost. \\n``The choice mustn't be determined by emotions. Some people are glued \\nto one thing (Mir) and don't care about the rest,'' Koptev said at \\na recent news conference. ``We must proceed from the understanding \\nof what would take us into the future, allow us to preserve our industry.'' \\nThe Russian Khrunichev company has earned over dlrs 200 million for \\nbuilding Zarya, whose design was based on earlier Soviet spacecraft, \\nincluding some of the Mir's six modules. \\n\\nThe first piece of the international space station was orbiting Earth \\nFriday, sprouting antennae and unfolding solar power panels as it \\nawaited other segments, which will eventually grow into the largest \\norbital laboratory in history. The module, called Zarya from the Russian \\nterm meaning sunrise or dawn, took a flawless ride into space atop \\na three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket that lifted off at 1:40 \\na.m. Eastern time from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The \\nlaunching was witnessed by the heads of the space agencies of the \\n16 nations that are sponsoring the station, which will cost at least \\n$40 billion to build over the next five years. Zarya, built in Russia \\nwith $240 million from the United States, is to be joined in two weeks \\nby the first American module, a docking hub called Unity. The space \\nshuttle Endeavour is to take off on Dec. 3 to rendezvous with Zarya \\nand attach the two units. This is to be followed by 43 more flights \\nby American and Russian rockets carrying more than 100 parts to be \\nassembled in space to form a 900,000-pound research station housing \\nup to seven astronauts. Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA, \\nsaid at a news conference following the launching, ``Now we only have \\n44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space walks and countless \\nproblems.'' But because of all the partner nations trusting each other \\nand working together, he said, ``the international space station is \\ngoing to be a reality.'' Even as the new space station is coming together, \\nquestions continue about the fate of Russia's existing space laboratory, \\nthe 12-year-old Mir. Because of the collapse of the Russian economy, \\ndoubts that Russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment \\nto support both projects led Russia to promise that it would abandon \\nMir and destroy the station by next summer. However, in recent weeks \\nRussian officials have been lobbying to find ways to extend Mir's \\nlife. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, President \\nBoris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday he \\nwas preparing a number of proposals on extending Mir's life past the \\nyear 2000. Support for such options has been growing in recent weeks \\namong Russian space officials, astronauts and nationalists, who see \\nMir as a symbol of Russian achievements in space. James Van Laak, \\nNASA's deputy manager of operations for the space station, said Friday \\nthat the agency had not received any formal proposals about extending \\nMir's life. ``NASA would find such a proposal unacceptable if it has \\nany measurable impact on the international space station,'' Van Laak \\nsaid in a telephone interview from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, \\n``No one has any objection to Mir or keeping it operational if the \\nRussians find a way to support both projects, but they have to demonstrate \\nthey can.'' Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said the \\nlaunching of Zarya, a 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply \\npower and propulsion in the early stages of station construction, \\nwas a needed vindication for the troubled Russian space program. ``The \\nRussian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to \\nfulfill all of its commitments on the international space station,'' \\nKoptev said. \\n\\nRussian space officials gave the first module of the international \\nspace station a routine tweak Saturday to push it into higher orbit, \\nand convened a meeting on Earth to map out its future. Flight controllers \\nfired one of the module's two maneuvering engines to raise it to an \\norbit about 230 kilometers (157 miles) in space, the station's public \\naffairs office said. Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev \\ntold reporters the maneuver was carried out ``with great accuracy,'' \\nand the 24-ton core module was cruising through space without any \\nproblems. The module, called Zarya, or Sunrise, lifted off Friday \\nfrom the Baikonur launchpad in Kazakstan into an initial orbit 200 \\nkilometers (125 miles) above Earth. Zarya is to serve as a space tugboat \\nin the early stages of the international project, providing propulsion, \\npower and communications. It will fly alone for two weeks before a \\nrendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to \\nbe launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. The international \\nspace station is a U.S.-led successor to Russia's Mir space station, \\nand is being heralded by space officials as the vehicle for unprecedented \\ninternational cooperation in space in the 21st century. The heads \\nof the space agencies of the United States, Russia, Japan and Canada, \\nalong with the European Space Agency, met in Moscow on Saturday to \\ndiscuss the project, the Interfax news agency reported. The space \\nagency heads agreed on a schedule for future meetings and on holding \\na scientific conference on the project somewhere in Europe, at an \\nunspecified date. Also Saturday, the head of Russia's Mission Control, \\nVladimir Lobachev, was quoted as saying that Russia would take the \\nlead role in managing the international space station during its first \\nfive years. Previously, space officials have said the station would \\nbe jointly controlled from Moscow and Houston, with the U.S. space \\nagency NASA taking a lead role. According to Interfax, Lobachev said \\nit made sense for Russia to control the project because the Russian-built \\nZarya and a Russian-built service module would perform most of the \\nlife support and navigational functions for the station's first five \\nyears. ``Furthermore, Russian engineers are more experienced in this \\njob and NASA officials are aware of this,'' he said. The space station \\nis expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, of which the United \\nStates is expected to pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problems \\ndelayed the initial launch by a year, and some critics have said the \\nstation amounts to an expensive way for NASA to keep Russia's beleaguered \\nspace program alive. The station will serve as an orbital home for \\nvisiting astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years. \\n\\nEndeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first \\npiece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control \\nmodule that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. \\nStacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered \\nthe most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to Nancy Currie, \\nthe shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned \\nUnity in the cargo bay on Saturday. The two station pieces are so \\nbig _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined \\nmass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates were going to \\nhave to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather \\nthan direct line of sight. Such a ``blind'' docking had never been \\nattempted before. Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time \\nfor the tasks. ``The main thing I've tried to do for the last two \\nyears working on this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin \\non everything,'' said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning \\ntheir final approach to Zarya _ Russian for Sunrise _ the shuttle's \\nsix astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched \\nlast month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilots to \\nfire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour \\nand the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the \\norbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little \\ntoo close for comfort,'' Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by \\nfar, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling \\nwith Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been \\nassigned to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya, \\na power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on \\nNov. 20. It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering \\nfor the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can \\nbe launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve \\nas a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. In case \\nZarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking \\nastronauts would have to manually fit them together. The astronauts \\nwould be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and \\ncables between the two components. In all, three spacewalks were planned \\nfor Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimates 43 more launches and \\n159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble \\nthe entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station \\nwill have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, \\nand house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. \\n\\nEndeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of \\nthe international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story \\ntower in the shuttle cargo bay. It was the first time that the Russian-built \\nZarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever \\ntouched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. \\n``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the \\ntwo pieces came together. ``Congratulations to the crew of the good \\nship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control. ``That's terrific.'' The \\n240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy \\nCurrie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle \\nrobot arm. ``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said. Then came the hard \\npart: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. The two station \\npieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the \\nother with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her \\ncrewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, \\nrather than direct line of sight. This was the first time such a ``blind'' \\ndocking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned the solar-winged \\nZarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly \\nabove Unity. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. \\nOnce she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, \\nand the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for \\nthe docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. \\nThe historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. The union \\n_ intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime _ set the \\nstage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical \\nconnectors and cables between the two components. Mission Control \\nthought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned and gave \\nthe six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. But everything occurred \\nmore or less when and how it was supposed to, aside from a piece of \\nspace junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach \\nto Zarya, the six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket \\nlaunched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilots \\nto fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between \\nEndeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles \\nfrom the orbiting debris.

It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering \\nfor the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can \\nbe launched next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called \\ndown that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian \\nflight controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed \\nin order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't \\nbe needed before next summer, officials said. The only other problem \\nwas with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part. \\nThe 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, \\nwill serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. \\nIt was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be \\nconnected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking \\nastronauts to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks \\nare planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical \\nconnections between the two modules but to install handrails and other \\ntools for future crews.

Russian space officials and others \\ncheered as ground control announced that the capsule had separated \\nfrom its booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers \\n(125 miles) above the Earth. ``Success,'' shouted one exultant official \\nsome 10 minutes after the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit. \\nThe heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participating in the \\nproject watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5 kilometers \\n(3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had prepared the launch \\nwere in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning by the highly toxic \\nrocket fuel. Russian and U.S. officials said the launch was ``flawless'' \\nand the module performed well during initial tests. They cautioned \\nthat much work remains to be done to get the ambitious space station \\nproject up and working. ``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about \\n1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems, but because of \\nthe trust and mutual respect ... the international space station is \\ngoing to be a reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference \\nafter the launch. His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said the launch \\nwas a vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry, proving \\nit could play a major role in space operations. ``Today we made a \\ntruly epoch-making step to carry out this project. The Russian space \\nindustry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of \\nits commitments on the international space station,'' he said. The \\nlaunch went smoothly, with the rocket soaring into the cloudy sky \\nabove the central Asian steppes. The huge roar of the rocket reverberated \\nfor dozens of kilometers (miles) across the empty plain around the \\nbase. The mood at the launch pad was tense before the launch, with \\nspace officials and workers anxiously making last-minute checks to \\nensure there were no problems. Solar power panels on the module were \\nsuccessfully deployed shortly after it reached its first orbit and \\nall systems were working normally, officials said. The launch of the \\nRussian cargo module, which had been delayed for more than a year, \\nushers in a new era of cooperation among former space-race rivals. \\nSpace officials expressed optimism that cooperation would further \\npromote world stability following the end of the Cold War. ``We still \\nhave some contradictions, we still have combat missiles aimed at each \\nother, but the predominant trend is the state of cooperation and doing \\nthings together,'' said Yuri Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company. \\nThe 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, was launched by a three-stage \\nProton booster rocket. Zarya is designed to serve as a space tugboat \\nin the early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and \\ncommunications. Engineers finished final preparations early Friday \\nfor the liftoff of the 24-ton module. The rocket blasted off under \\ncloudy skies and strong winds, and disappeared behind the clouds 40 \\nseconds later. The international space station, the U.S.-led successor \\nto Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be \\ncompleted by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that \\nwill take 45 assembly flights to complete. Russia's crucial participation \\nhas been hampered by the country's financial problems. The launch \\nof the first segment was postponed repeatedly, mainly because the \\nchronically broke Russian space agency couldn't afford to complete \\nanother part of the station that is to go up later. Zarya is to fly \\nalone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle \\nEndeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting \\nmodule. The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early \\n2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to \\nblast off next July or August. The space station is expected to cost \\nat least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay dlrs \\n24 billion. It will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts \\nand cosmonauts for at least 15 years. Russia has repeatedly failed \\nto meet deadlines for constructing the crew module, putting the whole \\nproject behind schedule. Having lost hope of getting promised government \\nfunds, the Russian space agency has sold research time on the station \\nto NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment. Russia rents \\nthe Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan. \\n\\nTwo astronauts ventured back out on another spacewalk Wednesday to \\nattach antennas to the international space station under construction \\nnearly 250 miles above Earth. For the second time this week, Jerry \\nRoss and James Newman floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour \\nto work on the seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open \\ncargo bay. Their No. 1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas \\nto Unity, the American-made side of the space station. Their other \\njob, time permitting, was trickier: trying to open a stuck antenna \\non Zarya, the Russian-built control module. The planned seven-hour \\nspacewalk was not nearly as difficult or crucial as Monday night's \\nouting, during which Ross and Newman hooked up 40 electrical connections \\nbetween Zarya and Unity. The plan called for the men to lug two suitcase-size \\nantennas about halfway up Unity and install them on opposite sides \\nof the 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, the antennas will provide \\na direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity \\nand NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would \\nhave to rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations. \\nThe electronic and computer hookups for the antennas will be made \\ninside Unity on Thursday, after the entire crew enters the orbiting \\nstation for the first time. Other spacewalking chores for Ross and \\nNewman on Wednesday evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer \\nmounted to the outside of Unity. Mission Control decided just before \\nthe spacewalk to let Newman take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna. \\nFlight controllers urged caution. The antenna was rolled up on a spool, \\nand engineers worried the 3-foot strip might pop open with enough \\nforce to hurt him if he got too close. Newman had a 10-foot grappling \\nhook for the job. The antenna is one of two that failed to open properly \\nfollowing Zarya's Nov. 20 launch from Kazakstan. One more spacewalk \\nis planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman \\nwill conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tools that will \\nbe used by future station visitors. Newman also may try to unjam the \\nother Zarya antenna. This was the sixth spacewalk for Ross during \\nhis 18-year NASA career, the most by an American, and the third for \\nNewman. \\n\", \"\\nSecretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday he was extending his North \\nAfrican tour to include talks with Libyan authorities. The remark \\nwas made without elaboration at a news conference in Algiers hours \\nbefore his arrival in Tunis, his final scheduled stop on a tour aimed \\nat unblocking plans for a U.N. referendum on the disputed Western \\nSahara. During his visit to Tunis, Annan is to meet with authorities \\nhere to discuss ``major regional and international issues and the \\nvarious initiatives aimed at solving unresolved problems,'' according \\nto the local press. A Western diplomat, speaking in Algiers on condition \\nof anonymity, said Annan would travel to Libya on Saturday to meet \\nwith authorities there on the 1988 Pan Am bombing that has led to \\nU.N. sanctions against Libya. Annan's trip to Tunisia is scheduled \\nto end Friday, according to the official program. The discrepancy \\nin the timing could not be immediately clarified. The U.N. Security \\nCouncil imposed sanctions in 1992, including a flight ban, to try \\nto force Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing that killed \\n270 people. The sanctions ban flights to and from the country. Neighboring \\nTunisia provides a land route for those traveling to Libya from the \\nregion. A week ago, before leaving for North Africa, Annan held out \\nthe possibility of a Libyan trip -- but only to help close a deal \\nto try the two suspects. A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly \\nwith Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try \\nthe suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using \\nScottish judges. Annan had said last week that he had hoped for a \\nbreakthrough in the case by the end of November. He said then that \\na trip to Libya ``to bring the issue finally to closure ... has not \\nbeen excluded.'' During his Algerian stay, \\n\\nQatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, \\nmet Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday, Libya's \\nofficial television reported. The television, monitored in Cairo, \\ndid not say where the meeting took place, but it showed Gadhafi, dressed \\nin a muddy brown gown and matching cap, receiving the Qatari minister \\nin a tent. Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's \\nsupport for Libya ``in its just position toward the so-called Lockerbie \\ncase,'' the television said, referring to Libya's objections to the \\nU.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 to press it to hand over two Libyans \\nwanted for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish \\ntown of Lockerbie that left 270 people dead. The television gave no \\nother details about the visit. \\n\\nLibyan leader Moammar Gadhafi began a surprise visit to neighboring \\nTunisia on Monday, his first known trip since injuring his hip in \\nJuly. Col. Gadhafi, whose country is under a U.N. air embargo, arrived \\nby land for ``a visit of brotherhood and rest'' at the invitation \\nof President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, an official statement said. \\nTunisian television did not show the Libyan leader but said he met \\nwith Ben Ali and several government ministers in a desert oasis at \\nTozeur, 400 kms (240 miles) south of Tunis, where foreign leaders \\nare entertained. Officials, however, did not give the duration or \\nfull itinerary of Gadhafi's visit. The trip was not announced in advance, \\nthough Ben Ali extended the invitation to Gadhafi when he visited \\nLibya in August. Gadhafi was first driven to Gabes, 365 kms (200 miles) \\nsouth of Tunis, after crossing the border at Ras Jedir where he was \\nmet by Interior Minister Ali Chaouch, officials said. It was Gadhafi's \\nfirst known trip abroad since he broke a bone near his hip while exercising \\nand underwent surgery in July, officials have said. The Libyan leader \\nlast visited Tunisia in January 1996, when he met Ban Ali in the southern \\ntown of Medenine. Since 1992, Libya has struggled with U.N. Security \\nCouncil sanctions that ban direct flights to and from the country. \\nThe move was aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted \\nin the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, \\nthat killed 270 people. The council has agreed to suspend the sanctions \\nonce Libya turns the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according \\nto Scottish law in the Netherlands, under a U.S.-British proposal. \\nGadhafi has offered to hand them over but demands any sentences be \\nserved in Dutch or Libyan prisons. \\n\\nWith the mournful lament of bagpipes and prayers of healing, the people \\nof Lockerbie paid tribute to the 270 people killed when a bomb brought \\nPan Am Flight 103 crashing down on this tiny town 10 years ago Monday. \\nThe hundreds who packed Dryfesdale Parish Church heard messages from \\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, \\nwho renewed their vows to punish the culprits who hid the bomb in \\na suitcase on Dec. 21, 1988. But they also heard quiet sobs that echoed \\nthroughout the century-old church as a few moments of silence were \\nobserved before the bagpiper blew her lament. ``In the lives that \\nwere lost, some very young, there was meaning and achievement,'' the \\nRev. David Almond told the gathering of about 600 people, which included \\n60 family members of those who perished. ``Our task in commemoration \\nis to continue that meaning and to build on that achievement.'' The \\ncongregation heard the children of the local elementary school sing \\na tribute, ``Let There be Love,'' as well as a message from the queen. \\n``We pray on this anniversary that the families will find solace together \\nin quiet remembrance across the world,'' the queen's message said. \\nIn a separate service in London's Westminster Abbey, attended by Blair, \\nForeign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince Andrew, the second son of \\nQueen Elizabeth II, hundreds listened as one-by-one the names of the \\n259 passengers and 11 of Lockerbie's own residents were read out as \\na candle was lit for each. Simultaneous services were also held at \\nArlington National Cemetery in Virginia and in Syracuse, New York, \\nwhich lost 35 college students in the crash. Each service began at \\n7:03 p.m. (1903 GMT), the moment when the plane disappeared from the \\nradar screen above Scotland. ``This was a very positive, emotional \\nday,'' Bert Ammerman of River Vale, New Jersey, whose brother Thomas \\ndied in the crash, said after the service. He said the people of Lockerbie \\nhave ``proven over the past 10 years that good intentions can overcome \\nevil.'' Earlier in the day, Prince Philip, the queen's husband, laid \\na wreath in Lockerbie's cemetery, where the town's Roman Catholic \\nparish priest at the time of the crash spoke to about 200 victims' \\nrelatives and townspeople about the ``ticking bomb'' of justice. ``Ten \\nyears ago, for you and for us, a bomb was ticking,'' the Rev. Pat \\nKeegans told the crowd, many of them visibly moved. ``Be assured of \\nthis _ there is another bomb ticking _ the irresistible bomb of justice \\nand truth. ``Be certain that our wreath-laying today is not a symbolic \\ngesture. It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have justice \\nand truth, until all who are responsible for your deaths are held \\naccountable,'' he said. Two Libyan suspects have been indicted in \\nconnection with the bombing, but have not yet been turned over for \\ntrial. Last week, Libya's Parliament gave its conditional approval \\nfor a trial in the Netherlands by a Scottish court, but said some \\nobstacles remained. The plane had just reached its cruising altitude \\nof 31,000 feet (9,400 kms), 42 minutes after taking off from London's \\nHeathrow Airport for New York, when it exploded in the night sky. \\nThe aircraft was felled by a small amount of high explosives smuggled \\non in a portable radio hidden inside a suitcase, which made its way \\nas checked baggage from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany, and then to London. \\n\\nTUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan left for Libya \\nSaturday to hold talks aimed at putting two suspects on trial for \\nthe 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie. Annan's one-day, 2nd graf \\npvs \\n\\nTRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in \\nLibya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects \\nin the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan's one-day \\nvisit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports \\nin the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the \\nsuspects. This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself \\nenough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the \\nsuspects. Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort \\nisland of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the U.N. Sanctions \\nCommittee to make the flight. A Libyan official, speaking on condition \\nof anonymity, said Annan had arrived in the country but refused to \\ngive details. Libyan media, controlled by the government, did not \\nreport on the visit in a sign that the subject is of great sensitivity. \\nIt was not known where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but diplomats \\nsaid Friday the meeting will likely take place in the northern coastal \\ntown of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the Libyan capital \\nof Tripoli. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its \\nrefusal to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset \\nAli al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. They are accused by the United \\nStates and Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish \\nvillage of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing \\n747 and 11 people on ground were killed. A Libyan legal team has been \\nmeeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British \\nproposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish \\nlaw and using Scottish judges. Dutch authorities say they have made \\narrangements to hold the trial at Camp Zeist, a former air force base \\nnear Utrecht. On Friday, Annan said the U.N. team ``has done some \\ngood work on the Lockerbie dossier.'' ``We will try to resolve some \\nproblems and to find solutions together _ once and for all,'' Annan \\nsaid. But in an apparent bid to distance the Libyan leader from a \\ndecision on the suspects, Libya's official news agency JANA said Friday \\nthat Gadhafi ``is neither president nor prime minister nor foreign \\nminister, but only the leader of the Libyan revolution.'' ``As such, \\nCol. Gadhafi is not empowered to sign an agreement,'' the report said. \\nJANA suggested that a decision on handing over the suspects would \\nhave to be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees before \\nbeing decided by the Parliament. The Netherlands was chosen as a venue \\nfor the trial after Libya itself proposed the trial be held in a third \\ncountry. Since then a new hurdle has cropped up over the imprisonment \\nof the suspects, if convicted. Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands \\nor Libya, but the United States and Britain say they should be imprisoned \\nin Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue. The U.N. sanctions \\non Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood. They \\nban air travel to and from the country and arms sales. Some Libyan \\nassets abroad have also been frozen. But many African countries have \\ndefied the air ban and their leaders have flown in and out of Libya. \\n\\nAfter meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. \\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing \\ntwo suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be \\nsecured in the ``not too distant future.'' Annan's comments came Saturday \\nafter he and Gadhafi failed to agree on handing over Abdel Basset \\nAli al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected in the \\n1988 bombing that killed 270 people. On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio \\nquoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which \\nis the equivalent of a foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution \\nto this crisis is within reach.'' He credited Annan's talks with Omar \\nal-Muntasser, Libya's foreign minister, who met with Annan in Sirte \\nbefore Annan went on to talks with Gadhafi. Sirte is 400 kilometers \\n(250 miles) east of the Libyan capital Tripoli. The official spoke \\nof ``fruitful talks'' but gave no details. The broadcast was monitored \\nby the British Broadcasting Corp. Also Sunday, British Foreign Secretary \\nRobin Cook said in an interview with the BBC that he had spoken with \\nAnnan on Sunday and was ``very encouraged by what he tells me.'' He \\nadded: ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of qualified optimism.'' \\nBritain would like to see the two suspects in custody by Dec. 21, \\nthe 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing. But Cook said Britain \\nwill not budge on the demand by Washington and London that the suspects \\nserve any sentence in a Scottish jail. Libya has asked that any prison \\nterms be served in the Netherlands or Libya. Annan spoke to reporters \\nin Tripoli after the meeting with Gadhafi and later when he arrived \\nback at this Tunisian island, where he had begun the day of diplomacy \\nthat lasted nearly 15 hours. The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get \\nLibya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects \\nbefore a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 \\nbombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. ``The talks have been fruitful and \\npositive,'' Annan said in Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness \\nand readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem. ``Libya \\nhas also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it \\nought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues,'' \\nhe said. ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be \\nable to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the \\nrelatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial. Annan \\nleft Jerba on Sunday for the United Arab Emirates, where he will attend \\na summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a federation of six Arab \\nGulf states. In Washington, James Foley, a State Department spokesman, \\nsaid the United States is awaiting a briefing from Annan but is ``disappointed'' \\nthat Libya has not complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions. \\n``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,'' Foley \\nsaid. ``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103 tragedy, this \\nhas gone on for far too long.'' The meeting with Gadhafi took place \\nafter Libya's official news agency, JANA, reported that Annan might \\nnot be able to meet with the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in \\nthe desert.'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on \\nan hour's trip into the desert in a four-wheel drive vehicle to meet \\nwith Gadhafi in a tent with a roaring fire outside. Earlier, Libyan \\nmedia suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects \\n_ an indication he was giving himself room in case he decides against \\ngiving up the two men wanted by the United States and Britain. JANA \\nindicated a decision on handing over the two suspects would have to \\nbe approved by some 500 grassroots national committees before being \\nconsidered by the Parliament. Libyan radio reported that the Parliament \\nhad been called to meet Tuesday in Sirte but did not say whether the \\nLockerbie issue would be discussed. Annan flew into Libya aboard a \\nspecial plane from Jerba after receiving clearance from the U.N. Sanctions \\nCommittee. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its \\nrefusal to hand over the two suspects. The U.N. sanctions ban air \\ntravel in and out of the country but do not cover oil exports, Libya's \\neconomic lifeblood. \\n\\nAfter meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. \\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing \\ntwo suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be \\nsecured in the ``not too distant future.''

The Netherlands \\nwas chosen as a venue after Libya proposed a trial in a neutral country. \\nBut a disagreement has arisen because Libya wants the suspects jailed \\nin the Netherlands or Libya if convicted, but the United States and \\nBritain insist they be imprisoned in Scotland. \\n\\nLouis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim group, met with Libyan \\nleader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery \\nfrom a hip injury, state-run Libyan radio reported. Improved health \\nwill enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading role in the service \\nof Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was quoted as saying by \\nthe radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Later, state-run \\ntelevision showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown robe and holding a \\ncane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital, \\nTripoli. The broadcast was monitored in Cairo. Gadhafi underwent surgery \\nlast July after injuring his hip, reportedly while exercising. The \\nvisit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three years. The \\nleader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently visited in \\nDecember 1997. It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived \\nin Libya or how long he would stay. Most visitors arrive by ferry \\nfrom Malta or travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia; U.N. sanctions \\nimposed in 1992 ban air travel to and from the country. Farrakhan \\nrepeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which were imposed to \\ntry to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing \\nof a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. \\nCiting the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury Department \\nprohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize he was awarded \\nby Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work. The Treasury also \\nbarred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer of a dlrs 1 billion \\ngift for Nation of Islam activities. His Nation of Islam is a black \\nnationalist group that says it is guided by the Koran. It is not considered \\na true Muslim sect by others who practice Islam. Farrakhan's message \\nto America's black community is one of self-reliance, discipline, \\nspirituality and separatism. Over the years, he has said that whites \\nand blacks should live separately, that Jews are ``bloodsuckers'' \\nwho have a ``gutter religion,'' and that whites are ``subhuman.'' \\nHe accuses news media of taking his comments out of context. \\n\\nLibya's justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspects in the \\n1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of Western \\npolitics when they go on trial. ``We want to be sure that the only \\naim of the trial is to show the truth ... and that it is held without \\na political or security background,'' Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim \\nal-Zuwiy said. He was addressing the General People's Congress, or \\nParliament, which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the \\ntwo men who are wanted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing. \\nA total of 270 people on board and on ground were killed when the \\njetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Libya has accepted \\nin principle to a trial before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. \\nBut the hand over of the suspects has been held up over Libya's demand \\nfor a guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in \\nLibya. The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects \\nserve their prison term in Britain. The Parliament meeting, expected \\nto last five days, is being held in the northern coastal town of Sirte \\nand was broadcast live on national television. Libyan media have suggested \\nthat Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi does not have the authority to \\nhand over the suspects and that any decision would have to be approved \\nby the Congress. ``Our argument is that since this is an exceptional \\ntrial, therefore this exception should include serving the jail term \\nin Libya, maybe under U.N. supervision,'' al-Zuwiy said. He said Libya \\nis seeking the guarantees from the West to ensure that the trial will \\nbe ``honest, just .. and without loopholes that (would) leave our \\ncitizens in illegal, unjust and inappropriate circumstances.'' Opening \\nthe debate, Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser gave the background \\nto the controversy since the Security Council imposed sanctions on \\nLibya in 1992 to force it to hand over the Lockerbie suspects for \\ntrial. The sanctions include a ban on air travel from and to Libya, \\nrestricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil equipment. \\nAl-Zuwiy, the justice minister, said the two suspects will have the \\nright to an appeal in the same court if it finds them guilty. On Saturday, \\nU.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi to iron out the \\ndetails. No agreement was reached but Annan said Libya is expected \\nto reach a decision soon. \\n\", \"\\nAmerica Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications \\nCorp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust \\nsuit against Microsoft Corp., executives involved in the talks said \\nSunday. The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving \\nAOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service \\nwith more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular \\nsite on the World Wide Web and its software business. AOL would also \\nenter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun \\nMicrosystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to \\nlarge corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web \\npages and other Internet technologies to many thousands of users at \\nthe same time. The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape \\nstock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be \\nannounced as soon as Monday morning. But executives involved in the \\ntalks cautioned Sunday night that some details remained to be negotiated. \\nThe Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses \\nat the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line services, Internet \\nsoftware and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two of Microsoft's \\nleading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At the same time, however, \\nit would end the independent existence of Netscape, an Internet software \\nmaker once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's \\ndominance of the personal computer software market. Netscape, founded \\nin 1994, has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from \\nMicrosoft. Its Navigator was the runaway leader in the market for \\nthe browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web. But Microsoft, \\nresponding to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, \\nquickly matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling \\nthe Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard \\nWindows operating system and giving it away free. Eventually, Microsoft's \\nbrowser technology caught up to Netscape's. Earlier this year, Netscape \\nannounced layoffs and started distributing Navigator for free as well, \\nas Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market. Since then, Netscape \\nhas focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction \\nfees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software \\nto corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which \\nto conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes it has the expertise \\nto increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's \\nprogrammers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's \\nsoftware sales as well, executives involved in the negotiations said. \\nAmong large corporations, Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among \\nthe most popular operating systems for the powerful computers that \\nrun Netscape's server software. The much smaller Netscape would be \\nplaced under the wing of AOL and Sun Microsystems. The three companies \\nhad combined revenues of more than $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, \\nby comparison, had revenues of more than $14 billion. ``This deal \\nwould insure that the fundamental elements of Netscape survive within \\nbigger companies that can drive its technologies forward,'' said David \\nB. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school and co-author \\nwith Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \\nof a recent book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape \\nand Its Battle with Microsoft.'' The impact of the deal, if any, on \\nthe government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is uncertain. It \\ndoes appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense _ namely, \\nthat it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances \\nshift all the time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should \\ntread gently. But the deal, government officials insist, should have \\nno direct effect on the current case. ``No matter how much the alliances \\nshift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's monopoly \\nand how it has used and abused its market power to protect its monopoly,'' \\nsaid David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the \\nMicrosoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems \\nare government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. And the serious merger \\ntalks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and \\nAOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the \\nstart of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the talks. \\nIndustry analysts suggest that the companies may have been emboldened \\nto take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly on the perception \\nthat the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives \\nof Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon Valley venture \\ncapital firm regarded as a power broker among Microsoft's rivals, \\nsit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL. Still, executives involved \\nin the talks said that the timing of the proposed deal was unrelated \\nto the antitrust trial. Nor should it, one person noted, be regarded \\nas ``a single-minded attempt to circle the wagons against Microsoft.'' \\nIndeed, AOL, according to one person close to the talks, plans to \\nkeep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser as the default choice on \\nits on-line service. One of the government's allegations in the antitrust \\nsuit is that Microsoft won out over Netscape as the main browser for \\nAOL because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly as a bargaining chip. \\nTo win the browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate on \\nthe Windows desktop, the main screen on more than 90 percent of personal \\ncomputers sold today. Staying with Microsoft's browser can be seen \\nas proof that AOL still regards placement on the Windows desktop as \\ncrucial, as well as a careful step to avoid undermining one of the \\nallegations in the government's case. For AOL, the Netscape purchase \\nwould accelerate its evolution toward the Internet. At present, its \\nflagship on-line service is a hybrid _ to its own proprietary service, \\nit has added a gateway to the World Wide Web. In addition, for consumers \\nwho do not subscribe to AOL's dial-up service, it also has its own \\nWeb site, aol.com, which attracts about 24 million visitors a month, \\naccording to Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, a market research firm. \\nIts big Web site offers a wide range of information, entertainment, \\nInternet chat and e-mail, a leading example of the all-in-one sites \\nthat have become known as portals. Netscape's Netcenter traffic has \\nslipped a bit in recent months, to under 16 million visitors a month, \\nbut it, too, is a major portal. Together, they should be a huge player \\nin the intensifying portal battle for viewers and resulting advertising \\nrevenues. Yahoo is the current leader among portal sites with more \\nthan 25 million monthly visitors, while Microsoft's site attracts \\nmore than 20 million a month. Though known as a new-media company \\nfor consumers, AOL is also interested in boosting its electronic commerce \\nbusiness with the Netscape purchase. AOL has recently done work with \\nEastman Kodak, American Greetings and other companies, not only promoting \\ntheir products to on-line subscribers but also building the Internet \\ninfrastructure of software to conduct electronic commerce. AOL notes \\nprojections like a recent one from Forrester Research Inc., which \\npredicted that worldwide Internet commerce could reach as high as \\n$3.2 trillion by 2003, or 5 percent of global sales. Sun Microsystems, \\nanalysts say, could be a strong partner for AOL in the market for \\nInternet commerce software. Sun is a corporate software company with \\na sales force of several thousand. As it moves increasingly to Internet \\ntechnology, AOL should prove an excellent partner for Sun in terms \\nof developing and using Sun's Java, an Internet programming language. \\nAnd while Netscape's browser no longer generates revenue on its own, \\nit is a distribution channel for Java technology. Having Netscape's \\nbrowser safely in the hands of a friendly company is of strategic \\nimportance for Sun, since Microsoft owns the alternative in the browser \\nmarket. AOL is expected pay little, if any, premium over Netscape's \\nstock price on Friday, executives close to the deal said, since Netscape \\nshares have more than doubled in the last month. In the last week \\nalone, Netscape's stock has jumped about $12, or nearly 45 percent, \\nfollowing reports that it was discussing a possible partnership with \\nAOL. The stock closed Friday at $39.1875, up $2.625. AOL's shares \\ngained $1.50 Friday, closing at $84.875. \\n\\nAmerica Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace \\nlargely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers who want to \\nflirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic \\nmail while checking the weather and sports scores. Now, the company \\nhas to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate \\nexecutives in pin-stripe suits. Nearly lost in the complexity of America \\nOnline's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's \\nannouncement that it will enter an entirely new market: working behind \\nthe computer screen to help companies open and operate online stores. \\nNetscape already has created software that made it a player in providing \\nsupport for what is already known as electronic commerce. But America \\nOnline now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider array of software, \\nconsulting and services for online merchants. ``Most companies that \\nsell to consumers realize that they need to get into the e-commerce \\nspace,'' said America Online president Robert Pittman in a news conference \\nTuesday. ``We see a major business in offering them an end-to-end \\nsolution.'' The market is big and growing bigger by the day. Forrester \\nResearch estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on electronic \\ncommerce software and another $5.3 billion on services that range \\nfrom graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire online stores. \\nBy 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market for electronic commerce \\nservices and software should top $35 billion. ``E-commerce services \\nare the silver bullet that will enable companies to be able to take \\nadvantage of the true business opportunities on the Web,'' said Traci \\nGere, an analyst at International Data Corp. ``The market is growing \\nvery rapidly, but it is very fragmented.'' Analysts say the leader \\ntoday in e-commerce services is IBM, which has a full line of offerings \\nfrom sophisticated software products to hand-holding consulting. Other \\ncompetitors include well-known information technology consulting companies \\nsuch as Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from the Arthur Andersen \\naccounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which runs computer systems \\nfor big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting \\nand consulting separately but under one umbrella. Software companies \\nlike Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically with \\nlittle or no consulting to help customers use them. There are also \\nplenty of new companies that have sprouted up to provide electronic \\ncommerce services. Some, like Agency.Com and Organic Online, started \\nbasically as advertising and design firms. Others, including U S Web \\nand Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting. In fact, those \\ntwo strains are blurring together, as exemplified by U S Web's pending \\nmerger with CKS Group. America Online argues that its advantage in \\nthis increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad \\nsubscriber base of about 15 million customers with Netscape software, \\nplus hardware from Sun Microsystems, which has joined in America Online's \\nventure into electronic commerce engineering. ``This is the first \\ntime anyone has put a true end-to-end solution that starts with the \\nsilicon and ends with the audience,'' said Barry Schuler, America \\nOnline's president for interactive services. ``We start with Sun's \\nline of servers, then the commerce tools to build a store, the support \\nservices to process orders and then a deal for online real estate \\nthat can drive the traffic.'' Despite the advantages Netscape and \\nSun bring, analysts say that America Online faces a variety of problems \\nin its new quest. Chief among them is whether it can appear to have \\nthe consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers \\ndemand. ``AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when \\nit comes to business-quality software,'' said Robert Chatham, a senior \\nanalyst with Forrester Research. Its decision to keep Netscape as \\na separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership \\nwith Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said. ``America \\nOnline doesn't look like a homogenous vendor,'' he added. ``It looks \\nlike customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape \\nand Sun.'' Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented \\ncompanies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said, \\nthat they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services \\nthat big corporate clients demand. ``Telecommunications companies \\nthat try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers \\nhave not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationships,'' \\nshe said. Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the \\ne-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to \\nsell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online. \\n``We are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar \\nstores are limited by their infrastructure,'' he said. ``They have \\nan online store, but their square footage is too small.'' Even before \\nthe Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic \\ncommerce software and services. It has been rewriting the software \\nthat lets companies open online stores to be based on universally \\naccepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language \\nused only on America Online. This new software, which now will be \\ncombined with Netscape's online store services, will be available \\nfor companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet. Similarly, \\nit has developed a service that lets users create a file with their \\ncredit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases \\nwithout retyping all that information each time. America Online is \\nworking to offer it _ for a fee _ to stores on the broader Internet. \\nThere is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic \\ncommerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to help companies \\ndecide whether and how to sell online without hurting their traditional \\nsale in stores. There are all sorts of computer systems to be developed, \\nranging from the online stores themselves to connecting those sites \\nto a company's existing inventory and accounting systems. There are \\ncreative services that include graphic design, media buying, customer \\nlist analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts. And there \\nare operational services that involve actually maintaining the big \\nservers that users connect to when they use the online stores that \\ndisplay catalogs, take orders and process payments. America Online, \\nSchuler said, will emphasize services that relate to marketing rather \\nthan back-office functions. ``We will consult on how to merchandise \\nand sell online,'' he said. ``We understand the consumer piece of \\nthe puzzle.'' Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic \\ncommerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and \\nhardware. ``The challenge is to prove that clients are getting the \\nbest possible solution for their business,'' said Robert Gett, the \\nchief executive of Viant. ``If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, \\ntheir answer is a bit tainted.'' Netscape does have an expanding force \\nof about 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming. \\nBut they have been most competitive, Gett said, in competing for nuts-and-bolts \\nprojects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and \\ncarry out a full-fledged strategy on the Web. ``They say, `Who knows \\nour software better than Netscape?''' Gett said. ``We help customers \\ndecide which platform is best for them.'' But America Online argues \\nthat the combined might of it, Netscape and Sun is just what the business \\nneeds. ``We always believed that commerce, that is buying goods and \\nservices, is the huge revenue stream of the future,'' Schuler said. \\n``We have only seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg.'' \\n\\nThe outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off, \\nbut one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail trial. \\nThe government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a striking \\ndegree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages. The human \\ntestimony often pales next to the e-mail evidence. On the stand or \\nin videotaped testimony, the people being questioned shrug, mumble \\nand forget. The e-mail is alive with ideas and competitive zeal, punctuated \\nwith profanity and exclamation points. The second week of the trial \\nended with the prosecutors being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination \\nby Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show \\nseveral hours of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft \\nchairman. With a new witness, an executive of Apple Computer Inc., \\ntaking the stand Monday, it is uncertain when the Gates tape will \\nbe played. The Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft \\nbelieve that the tape will strengthen their case because it shows \\nGates saying he was not involved in plans to take what the government \\nalleges were illegal steps to stifle competition in the Internet software \\nmarket. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice Department's \\ntrial lawyer, offers an ``opportunity to judge Gates' credibility.'' \\nBut the Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes an issue not \\nbecause of the videotape but because his taped remarks can be compared \\nand contrasted with the e-mail he wrote and received. The e-mail record, \\nthe government insists, shows Gates waist-deep in plotting the anti-competitive \\ndeals and bullying tactics that he denies or professes to have never \\nheard of in his taped deposition. If his machinations are central \\nto the government's case, why not summon Gates to the trial? ``The \\ngovernment does not need to put Gates on the stand, because we have \\nhis e-mail and memoranda,'' Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the states, \\ntold the court. The Microsoft legal team has for months been preparing \\nits e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that looks damaging \\nis taken out of context. ``I urge your honor,'' John Warden, Microsoft's \\nlead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, ``to view with considerable \\nskepticism the crazy quilt of e-mail fragments that seem to form the \\ncore of the government's case.'' But Microsoft has also mounted an \\ne-mail counterattack, culled from the millions of messages it obtained \\nby subpoena from competitors in pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination \\nritual is to present a government witness with an internal e-mail \\nfrom his company and then pose a declaration as a question. These \\ninterrogations have two refrains: Isn't it true your company does \\nexactly what you are accusing Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true \\nthat Microsoft prevailed not because it is a predatory monopolist \\nbut because of its superior technology? Microsoft is accused of trying \\nto prod companies to stay out of its way. So last week, for example, \\nWarden produced e-mail from Stephen Case, the chairman of America \\nOnline, suggesting a partnership with Netscape Communications Corp. \\nin which both companies would focus on their respective strengths. \\nThat division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to achieve \\nthe goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described in \\nan earlier e-mail as beating ``the Beast From Redmond that wants to \\nsee us both dead'' _ a reference to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, \\nWash. Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written communication. \\nBy the 1920s, as typewriters became common, typed memoranda started \\nto be used in court cases. From the 1950s through the 1980s, legal \\nexperts say, there was an explosion of documentation fueled by the \\nnew technologies of electric typewriters, photocopying and fax machines, \\nand then personal computers. And e-mail, they add, has played an important \\nrole in legal inquiries for years, like the Iran-contra case in the \\n1980s when e-mail found in Oliver North's computer proved crucial. \\nBut the Microsoft case is the result of a sweeping government antitrust \\ninvestigation of a high-technology company where e-mail has supplanted \\nthe telephone as the most common instrument of communication. ``E-mail \\nhas just revolutionized investigations of this kind,'' one senior \\nJustice Department official said. While under investigation, Microsoft \\nhas handed over to the government an estimated 30 million documents, \\nmostly e-mail. In the trial, the two sides have submitted about 3,000 \\nexhibits, mainly e-mail. And in their e-mail, people often communicate \\nmore frankly and informally than when writing a letter or a report \\n_ tap it out, punch a button and it's gone into cyberspace. But e-mail \\ncommunication is documentary evidence, which in legal cases provides \\na rich, contemporaneous record of what people were thinking and planning \\nat the time. It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony, \\nso often coached by lawyers and crafted by selective memory. ``The \\ne-mail record certainly makes the I-don't-recall line of response \\nharder to sustain,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in \\nthe Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings \\nInstitution. It can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to contradictions \\nin testimony. And that is what the government will do in attacking \\nGates' credibility with his videotaped deposition, taken over three \\ndays in August. The government offered a glimpse of that strategy \\non the first day of the trial. It showed a few brief clips of a point \\nin the deposition when Gates was asked about a meeting on June 21, \\n1995, at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offered to divide \\nthe browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the \\ncompany, which is its chief rival in that market. In the taped deposition, \\nGates says he recalled being asked by one of his subordinates whether \\nhe thought it made sense to invest in Netscape. He said that he was \\nasked about it after the June 1995 meeting and replied, ``I didn't \\nsee that as something that made sense.'' But in an e-mail on May 31, \\n1995, Gates urged an alliance with Netscape. ``We could even pay them \\nmoney as part of the deal,'' he wrote, ``buying a piece of them or \\nsomething.'' The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail, \\nthough, does not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft \\nmade an illegal offer to Netscape. To be sure, it is what Microsoft \\ndid _ not what it said in e-mail communications _ that counts most. \\n``But once the e-mail that looks bad gets in the record, you end up \\ndoing what Microsoft's lawyers are going to spend much of this trial \\ndoing _ trying to explain it away,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading \\nantitrust litigator with the firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in \\nNew York. \\n\\nAmerica Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace \\nlargely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers who want to \\nflirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic \\nmail while checking the weather and sports scores. Now, the company \\nhas to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate \\nexecutives in pin-stripe suits. Nearly lost in the complexity of America \\nOnline's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's \\nannouncement that it will enter an entirely new market: working behind \\nthe computer screen to help companies open and operate online stores. \\nNetscape already has created software that made it a player in providing \\nsupport for what is already known as electronic commerce. But America \\nOnline now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider array of software, \\nconsulting and services for online merchants. ``Most companies that \\nsell to consumers realize that they need to get into the e-commerce \\nspace,'' said America Online president Robert Pittman in a news conference \\nTuesday. ``We see a major business in offering them an end-to-end \\nsolution.'' The market is big and growing bigger by the day. Forrester \\nResearch estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on electronic \\ncommerce software and another $5.3 billion on services that range \\nfrom graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire online stores. \\nBy 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market for electronic commerce \\nservices and software should top $35 billion. ``E-commerce services \\nare the silver bullet that will enable companies to be able to take \\nadvantage of the true business opportunities on the Web,'' said Traci \\nGere, an analyst at International Data Corp. ``The market is growing \\nvery rapidly, but it is very fragmented.'' Analysts say the leader \\ntoday in e-commerce services is IBM, which has a full line of offerings \\nfrom sophisticated software products to hand-holding consulting. Other \\ncompetitors include well-known information technology consulting companies \\nsuch as Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from the Arthur Andersen \\naccounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which runs computer systems \\nfor big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting \\nand consulting separately but under one umbrella. Software companies \\nlike Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically with \\nlittle or no consulting to help customers use them. There are also \\nplenty of new companies that have sprouted up to provide electronic \\ncommerce services. Some, like Agency.Com and Organic Online, started \\nbasically as advertising and design firms. Others, including U S Web \\nand Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting. In fact, those \\ntwo strains are blurring together, as exemplified by U S Web's pending \\nmerger with CKS Group. America Online argues that its advantage in \\nthis increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad \\nsubscriber base of about 15 million customers with Netscape software, \\nplus hardware from Sun Microsystems, which has joined in America Online's \\nventure into electronic commerce engineering. ``This is the first \\ntime anyone has put a true end-to-end solution that starts with the \\nsilicon and ends with the audience,'' said Barry Schuler, America \\nOnline's president for interactive services. ``We start with Sun's \\nline of servers, then the commerce tools to build a store, the support \\nservices to process orders and then a deal for online real estate \\nthat can drive the traffic.'' Despite the advantages Netscape and \\nSun bring, analysts say that America Online faces a variety of problems \\nin its new quest. Chief among them is whether it can appear to have \\nthe consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers \\ndemand. ``AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when \\nit comes to business-quality software,'' said Robert Chatham, a senior \\nanalyst with Forrester Research. Its decision to keep Netscape as \\na separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership \\nwith Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said. ``America \\nOnline doesn't look like a homogenous vendor,'' he added. ``It looks \\nlike customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape \\nand Sun.'' Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented \\ncompanies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said, \\nthat they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services \\nthat big corporate clients demand. ``Telecommunications companies \\nthat try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers \\nhave not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationships,'' \\nshe said. Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the \\ne-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to \\nsell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online. \\n``We are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar \\nstores are limited by their infrastructure,'' he said. ``They have \\nan online store, but their square footage is too small.'' Even before \\nthe Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic \\ncommerce software and services. It has been rewriting the software \\nthat lets companies open online stores to be based on universally \\naccepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language \\nused only on America Online. This new software, which now will be \\ncombined with Netscape's online store services, will be available \\nfor companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet. Similarly, \\nit has developed a service that lets users create a file with their \\ncredit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases \\nwithout retyping all that information each time. America Online is \\nworking to offer it _ for a fee _ to stores on the broader Internet. \\nThere is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic \\ncommerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to help companies \\ndecide whether and how to sell online without hurting their traditional \\nsale in stores. There are all sorts of computer systems to be developed, \\nranging from the online stores themselves to connecting those sites \\nto a company's existing inventory and accounting systems. \\n\\nAmerica Online Inc. wants to become the ``next Microsoft'' in two \\npromising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another \\ncompany _ the Internet media business and electronic commerce. With \\nits proposed purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, the nation's \\nlargest dial-up online service with more than 14 million subscribers, \\nhopes to take a significant step toward that ambitious goal. If the \\n$4 billion deal is completed _ the companies had not reached a final \\nagreement as of Monday night _ AOL would acquire a leading Internet \\nbrand and enlarge its wired audience by absorbing the millions who \\nregularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site on the World Wide \\nWeb. ``Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role \\nas the premier Internet media company,'' said James F. Moore, president \\nof Geopartners Inc., a consulting firm. ``America Online is assembling \\nthe kind of audience numbers that will convince people the Internet \\nis becoming a mainstream media.'' In the new media business, as in \\ntraditional media like television or newspapers, eyeballs translate \\ninto advertising revenue. But what really intrigues media executives \\nand consumer marketers about the new media _ news, entertainment and \\nservices rendered in computer code _ is that it is inherently a two-way \\nmedium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the \\nclick of a mouse button The interaction that advertisers and marketers \\nwant to see, of course, is buying. And it is the potential for exploiting \\nan instant, direct connection to consumers that has fueled all the \\nrecent optimism about electronic commerce. Today, companies are selling \\neverything from books to baby clothes over the Internet. Most companies \\nhave not progressed beyond the experimentation stage, but there are \\na handful of encouraging success stories like Amazon.com, the on-line \\nbookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business is analyzing \\ntrends in cyberspace, projects that Internet commerce could reach \\n$3.2 trillion, or 5 percent of all sales worldwide. AOL is at the \\nforefront of this convergence of media and commerce converge, and \\nintegration reflected in the lineage of its leaders. Steve Case, the \\nchairman, was once a new-product manager for Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, \\nwhile Robert Pittman, the president, is a former MTV executive. Microsoft \\nis also investing heavily in new media and electronic commerce. It \\nhas an online service, MSN, which competes with AOL, as well as information-and \\ncommerce Web sites that focus on travel, cars and real estate. It \\nalso owns Sidewalk, a network of local sites that list movies, restaurants \\nand stores in cities around the country including Seattle and New \\nYork. Its MSNBC Internet news service is half of a joint venture with \\nNBC. Microsoft is expected to be a formidable competitor in the media-and-commerce \\nbusiness. It has no shortage of bright people and it has more money \\nthan any rival. Besides deep pockets, Microsoft has the built-in advantage \\nin any computer-based medium because its Windows operating system \\nruns more than 90 percent of personal computers sold today. Its control \\nof the Windows desktop gives it the most valuable piece of commercial \\nreal estate in the information age. In theory, at least, owning that \\ndesktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumers to its online \\nofferings _ an issue that is key to the government's antitrust suit \\nagainst Microsoft. But so far, Microsoft has started slowly in the \\nfields of Internet media and electronic commerce. ``Microsoft may \\nwant to, but it does not dominate these new markets,'' said Richard \\nShaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, a research firm. ``America \\nOnline recognizes that the big opportunity is in these emerging growth \\nbusinesses like electronic commerce instead of trying to take Microsoft \\non head-on.'' Still, if the Netscape deal is completed, AOL will also \\nfind itself in the software business in a way it has never been in \\nthe past. Netscape is known as the pioneer in the commercial development \\nof software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Microsoft saw the \\nbrowser software as a direct threat to its industry dominance and \\npursued that market aggressively, bundling its own browser with its \\nWindows and giving it away free _ tactics that have been challenged \\nby the government. But Netscape no longer generates revenues from \\nits browser, which it now also distributes for free, but from the \\nsale of heavy-duty software sold to corporations. Much of this software \\nis used as the technological ``back office'' for electronic commerce \\n_ used in building Web sites and processing transactions. A surprising \\nelement in the proposed deal is that AOL intends to hold onto Netscape's \\ncorporate software business instead of selling it off to an established \\nsoftware company. ``America Online just doesn't have credibility in \\nthat market,'' observed Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts \\nInstitute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. Executives close \\nto AOL explain the decision as the need to provide full-line offerings \\nfor electronic commerce, from corporate Web site to the computer screens \\nof consumers. But AOL has decided it needs help to preserve and strengthen \\nNetscape's corporate software business. To do that, it has brought \\nin Sun Microsystems Inc. in a side deal, which has complicated the \\ntransaction considerably. AOL, according to executives close to the \\nproposed deal, will own Netscape, but it will have a joint marketing \\nand development partnership with Sun. As part of the deal, AOL will \\nagree to purchase about $300 million worth of Sun's computers for \\nits service, while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable \\namounts of Netscape software, which Sun's sales force must sell. Still, \\nAOL and Sun have a longer-term objective as well _ one that promises \\nto place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft. For nearly a \\nyear, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, has been working \\nclosely with AOL, according to Sun executives. A former Harvard economics \\nprofessor who taught Scott McNealy, the Sun chairman, Raduchel has \\nfocused on Sun's Internet programming technologies, called Java and \\nJini, both of which are seen as potential threats to Microsoft's dominance. \\nBy combining Sun's technology prowess with AOL's powerful consumer \\nbrand, the Sun executives say, there is the potential for a kind end-run \\naround Microsoft's grip on desktop computing. In its research laboratories, \\nSun has been working on a stripped-down network computer _ a simple-to-use \\ninformation appliance, which could cost as little as $200 or be given \\naway as part of a subscription service. The concept is that AOL's \\nInternet media and electronic commerce services could be delivered \\nto many more homes than today because many people still shun the expense \\nand difficulty of using a personal computer. The appliance would be \\nmainly a receiver and screen, with most of the computing power residing \\non vast central computers serving up information as users request \\nby tapping a few buttons. Sun's technological specialty is this kind \\nof centralized ``network'' computing. If the long-term AOL-Sun vision \\never materialized _ certainly a three-to-five year bet, at the least \\n_ it could give both companies a boost and technological independence \\nfrom Microsoft. \\n\\nStock prices vaulted to record levels Monday, furthering a recovery \\nthat as recently as two months ago seemed nearly unthinkable. ``I \\nthought we were in the most serious correction since 1990, but I never \\nthought or wrote that the bull market was over,'' said Byron Wien, \\nU.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``Now \\nit seems all of that is behind us.'' The Dow Jones industrial average \\nrose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,374.27. The record is the \\nfirst since July 17, when the Dow closed at 9,337.97. Since Aug. 31, \\nwhen the Dow stood at 7,539.07 after a steep slide, the blue-chip \\ngauge has risen more than 24 percent. For the year, the Dow is up \\n18.54 percent and has a chance of rising more than 20 percent for \\na fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before. Broader \\naverages also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set \\na record, rising 24.66 points, or 2.12 percent, to 1,188.21. The Nasdaq \\ncomposite index did not reach a new high but posted the biggest percentage \\ngain Monday, rising 49.21 points, or 2.55 percent, to 1,977.42. And \\nthe Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues gained 3.86 points, \\nor nearly 1 percent, to 398.15. Monday's action was energized by a \\ndaily record for the number of mergers and acquisitions valued at \\n$1 billion or more. The merger announcements not only prompted investors \\nto change estimates of how much companies were worth but also indicated \\ncoming declines in the outstanding shares of stock. ``This may be \\na supply-demand story, where demand for stocks is rising and the supply \\nof stock is reduced as one company after another merges,'' said Hugh \\nJohnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. ``The flow \\nof money into mutual funds is fairly strong, and there is pressure \\non managers to put that money to work.'' Two deals seemed to be catalysts \\nfor broad swaths of stocks. News that Bankers Trust may be close to \\naccepting an $8.9 billion offer from Deutsche Bank of Germany heightened \\ninterest in financial-services and bank stocks. And word that America \\nOnline may acquire Netscape Communications for $4 billion in stock \\npowered Internet and other technology stocks to even loftier valuations. \\nAmong financial companies, J.P. Morgan gained 6 1/16, to 115 11/16. \\nAmerican Express was up 4 3/8, to 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jumped \\n4 3/8, to 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 3 9/16, to \\n42}. Netscape was the most active stock Monday, gaining 2}, to 41 \\n15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, to 89\\\\. Other Internet stocks \\nalso surged, and analysts said the group, which has seen meteoric \\ngains in recent weeks, was ripe for a steep correction. Yahoo and \\nAmazon.com both became $200 stocks on Monday. Yahoo rose 30 7/16, \\nto 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, to 218. ``The performance \\nof the Internet stocks is an unsettling sign,'' Wien said. Still, \\nmore-established technology shares also had a very good day. IBM rose \\n7, to 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, to 119 3/16. And Intel closed \\nat 113 9/16, up 1{. After Monday's big price moves, Wien said that \\naccording to his calculations, stocks were about 10 percent overvalued. \\nBy contrast, in the middle of July the market was 20 percent overvalued, \\nhe said. Nonetheless, the market's recovery, which has been buttressed \\nby three cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, has \\nleft many longtime Wall Street hands grasping for historical parallels. \\n``At this point we are in new ground,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads \\nhis own market research firm. ``At the beginning of the year, I said \\nmy target for the Dow was 10,000 by the end of 1998. If anyone had \\nasked when the market went through what now looks like a corrective \\nblip, I would have said my new target would have been about 9,000. \\nI am surprised the 10,000 figure came back on the table'' for this \\nyear. \\n\\nMicrosoft Corp. argued in federal court Monday that the proposed acquisition \\nof Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online seriously undermined \\nthe government's antitrust suit against the software giant. ``From \\na legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under \\nthe government,'' William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president \\nfor legal affairs, said Monday morning on the courthouse steps. The \\nreasoning behind this assertion, Microsoft says, is that the proposed \\ndeal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software industry are \\nhealthy and vibrant _ even with all of the illegal and anti-competitive \\npractices alleged in the government's suit. But David Boies, the government's \\nlead attorney, said all of that was irrelevant. ``Whatever the deal \\nends up being _ if there ends up being a deal _ is not going to remove \\nany of the obstacles that Microsoft has placed in the path of competition \\nin this industry,'' he said. Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer \\nwho was questioning a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, \\nsuggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition \\nundermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed \\ntoward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match \\nthe one it apparently holds in operating systems. After all, about \\n22 percent of Americans who use the Internet reach it through America \\nOnline. And at present AOL uses Microsoft's Web browser, Internet \\nExplorer, as the service's default choice. In exchange for that, Microsoft \\nplaces an AOL advertisement and Internet link in Windows 98. Lacovara \\nasked the witness whether, once AOL's service contract expires in \\nJanuary, he would ``expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft \\nsoftware.'' Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. ``It is not at all clear \\nto me that AOL's incentive to do this is changed by this proposed \\nmerger with Netscape.'' He noted that America Online officials had \\nsaid their need to be among the online services featured in Windows \\nforced them to accept Microsoft terms _ establishing Internet Explorer \\nas the default choice. Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton the question \\nthat lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness _ and Microsoft's \\nlarger assertion Monday about the proposed Netscape-AOL deal. ``Surely \\nthis combination,'' he asked, ``tells you something about the nature \\nof competition in the software industry?'' Warren-Boulton's answer \\nwas probably not the one Lacovara had been after. ``To the extent \\nthat this potential merger is the result of Microsoft's actions with \\nthese exclusive contracts and other actions,'' he said, ``it is unfortunate \\nto see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape, the brightest, newest \\nstar.'' Warren-Boulton's purpose on the stand for the government is \\nto establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system \\nsoftware; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a Microsoft \\noperating system. That is the foundation under most of the government's \\ncase since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist \\nthat would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition. Through \\nrepeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried to make \\nthe case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share was ephemeral. \\nThe software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, \\nthat Microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment _ \\na point of view the company encourages among its employees. On Friday \\nand Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are \\nplacing other operating systems on the market, and some software companies \\n_ principally Microsoft's greatest rivals _ are writing software for \\nthese new systems. But Warren-Boulton argued that ``the existence \\nof these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not \\nmean in any way that Microsoft does not have monopoly power.'' On \\nMonday afternoon, Lacovara made an issue of the success Apple Computer \\nCo. is having selling its new iMac computer. He entered into evidence \\nan Apple news release issued last month showing, among other things, \\nthat 12.5 percent of the people buying Apple's new iMac computer had \\npreviously owned a Windows machine. Apple computers use a different \\noperating system, Mac-OS. \\n\\nEnvisioning a thoroughly networked world in which the World Wide Web \\nis a limitless marketplace of information, entertainment, products \\nand services, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid out the details of \\nits agreement to buy the Netscape Communications Corporation for $4.2 \\nbillion. By moving quickly toward what both companies have recently \\ncome to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media, \\nAmerica Online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle \\nalready joined by giants like the Microsoft Corp. and the International \\nBusiness Machines Corp. to transform the greater part of cyberspace \\ninto a vast virtual mall. Part of that vision rests on an alliance \\nwith Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated as part of the \\ndeal. Sun not only brings a cyber-savvy sales force to the effort \\nbut, even more importantly, a strong technology partner in developing \\nNetscape's industrial-strength software for running Internet sites. \\nSun is indeed a technology heavyweight. It owns the Java programming \\nlanguage specially designed for Internet applications, and Solaris, \\namong the most popular commercial operating systems for the powerful \\ncomputers that big corporations use to serve up Internet services \\nlike the World Wide Web, e-mail and retail transactions. It also manufactures \\na highly respected line of powerful computers based on its own microprocessor \\nchips. But for America Online _ and for the big Internet players against \\nwhich it will compete _ the real potential gold mine lies further \\ndown the road, perhaps five years away, when people will venture on \\nline for information or shopping not only from personal computers \\nbut from inexpensive Internet appliances costing $200 each, or maybe \\nincluded free as part of a subscription service, just as some cellular \\nphones are now. Today, being wired remains a comparatively elitist \\nactivity _ an estimated 25 percent of American households had access \\nto the Internet last year, and 5 percent of households bought merchandise \\non line. But the executives at America Online and Netscape hope that \\ntheir deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the Net \\nis ubiquitous, when people will tap into the World Wide Web from appliance-like \\ndevices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes or computers \\nas routinely as they use the telephone today. ``A new generation of \\nInternet devices to be able to deliver our service anywhere is a key \\npart of what this deal is about in the long run,'' said Stephen M. \\nCase, 40, the chairman of America Online. For the present, however, \\nthe idea is to make America Online, the nation's leading online service, \\nthe standard way to get onto the Internet, the executives explained. \\nNetscape, the Internet pioneer, is a crucial part of that effort, \\nthey said. There is no assurance that this vision of the technological \\nfuture will prove accurate or, even if it does, that the America Online-Netscape \\ncombination will lead the way. Still, the long-range game plan helps \\nexplain what brought America Online and Netscape together. And the \\nability of the companies' executives to sell that vision to Netscape's \\nwhiz-kid programmers in particular will determine whether the merger \\nsucceeds. Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., is likely \\nbecome a prime target for Silicon Valley headhunters. As is the case \\nwith any software company, Netscape's key asset is its talented programmers, \\nand many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for America \\nOnline, which still has a reputation as a middle-brow service catering \\nto online newcomers, known derisively as ``newbies.'' Stock options \\nand other financial incentives will be tailored to try to keep Netscape \\nemployees on board. ``But these people want to change the world, and \\nwe've got to be clear that joining with America Online, along with \\nthe Sun component, really is a bigger opportunity for us,'' said Marc \\nAndreessen, the 26-year-old cofounder of Netscape who led a team of \\nyoung programmers from the supercomputing center at the University \\nof Illinois to Silicon Valley to start the Internet software company \\nin 1994. ``This ought to be the preeminent Internet company over the \\nnext decade,'' Andreessen declared, speaking from a cell phone on \\na streetcorner in Palo Alto, Calif. For his part, Andreessen, a Netscape \\nexecutive vice president, will become Netscape's chief technology \\nofficer for the next three or four months, until the merger is completed. \\nHis new job at America Online has not yet been determined, but it \\nis likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company as \\nwell, an America Online executive said. Already, according to one \\nNetscape board member, Andreessen has delivered a 12-page single-spaced \\nmemorandum to Case, setting out his view of the technological road \\nmap the new company should follow into the future, emphasizing the \\nopportunities for electronic commerce in an environment in which most \\npeople are linked to the Internet. Netscape, populated with computing \\nsophisticates, and America Online, known as an on-ramp to the Internet \\nfor the technologically challenged, seem a corporate odd couple. But \\nthe two companies, its executives explained, had been evolving toward \\neach other for more than a year. In a telephone interview from America \\nOnline's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape as an \\nenterprise that had ``morphed itself'' from a company dependent on \\nsales of its software used to browse the World Wide Web _ and ``in \\nMicrosoft's cross-hairs'' _ into a business that relied on advertising \\nand other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling \\nsoftware to corporations to handle electronic commerce. The Netscape \\ntransformation was largely a reaction to Microsoft's competitive assault \\non its browser business _ a central element in the government's antitrust \\nsuit against Microsoft. Microsoft bundled its browser into its industry-standard \\nWindows operating system, and gave away the browser for free. The \\ngovernment alleges these steps were part of a pattern of anticompetitive \\npractices, while Microsoft maintains the moves were intended mainly \\nto benefit consumers. Early this year, after laying off workers and \\nsuffering a large loss last year, Netscape announced that it would \\nalso distribute its browser for free. It seems to have stabilized \\nits business around its new model. Netscape announced Tuesday that \\nit earned $2.7 million on revenues of $162 million in its fourth fiscal \\nquarter, which ended in September. Yet America Online has also changed \\nin the last couple of years, moving well beyond its reputation as \\nan online service for beginners. It now has an Internet chat service \\nand runs its own all-in-one site on the Web, known as a ``portal,'' \\nwhich includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and \\nonline shopping. ``America Online has really changed from a closed \\nonline service for novice users to an Internet media and technology \\ncompany with a diverse set of brands,'' Andreessen said. ``These two \\ncompanies have been moving in the same direction, and the fit is a \\ngood one.'' \\n\\nAmerica Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications \\nCorp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust \\nsuit against Microsoft Corp., executives involved in the talks said \\nSunday. The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving \\nAOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service \\nwith more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular \\nsite on the World Wide Web and its software business. But as part \\nof the deal, AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development \\npartnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business \\nof selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to \\nserve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands \\nof users at the same time. The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares \\nfor Netscape stock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal \\ncould be announced as soon as Monday morning. But executives involved \\nin the talks cautioned Sunday night that some details remained to \\nbe negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three \\nbusinesses at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line services, \\nInternet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two \\nof Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At the same \\ntime, however, it would subsume Netscape, an Internet software maker \\nonce regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance \\nof the personal computer software market. Netscape, founded in 1994, \\nhas struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from Microsoft. \\nIts Navigator was the runaway leader in the market for the browser \\nsoftware used to navigate the World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding \\nto the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly \\nmatching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the \\nMicrosoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows \\noperating system and giving it away free. Earlier this year, Netscape \\nannounced layoffs and started distributing Navigator for free as well, \\nas Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market. Since then, Netscape \\nhas focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction \\nfees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software \\nto corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which \\nto conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes it has the expertise \\nto increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's \\nprogrammers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's \\nsoftware sales as well, executives involved in the negotiations said. \\nSun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among the most popular operating \\nsystems for the large, powerful computers that run Netscape's server \\nsoftware. ``This deal would insure that the fundamental elements of \\nNetscape survive within bigger companies that can drive its technologies \\nforward,'' said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business \\nschool and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts \\nInstitute of Technology of a recent book, ``Competing on Internet \\nTime: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft.'' The impact \\nof the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft \\nis uncertain. It does appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's \\ndefense _ namely, that it operates in a fast-moving industry where \\ncorporate alliances shift all the time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust \\npolicy should tread gently. But the deal, government officials insist, \\nshould have no direct effect on the current case. ``No matter how \\nmuch the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's \\nmonopoly and how it has used and abused its market power to protect \\nits monopoly,'' said David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial \\nlawyer in the Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL \\nand Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. \\nAnd the serious merger talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer \\nJames Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, \\nor just after the start of the Microsoft trial, according to people \\nclose to the talks. Industry analysts suggest that the companies may \\nhave been emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly \\non the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. \\nAnd representatives of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon \\nValley venture capital firm regarded as a power broker among Microsoft's \\nrivals, sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL. \\n\\nThe New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25: America \\nOnline's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with \\nSun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape \\ncan change in fast-moving technical fields. But it does not lessen \\nthe need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust \\nsuit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software. The department \\nhas presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly \\nin operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off \\ncompetition in other software realms. The Internet has risen so quickly \\nas an information medium that only four years ago, in his book ``The \\nRoad Ahead,'' Bill Gates scarcely mentions it. In addition, only a \\ncouple of years ago America Online, the world's biggest online service, \\nwas having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it \\nwas widely derided as ``America On Hold.'' Now Microsoft has moved \\nso aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing \\nit of predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed forward \\nto make deals with other Internet players. In its antitrust suit against \\nMicrosoft, the federal government charges that the company has illegally \\nbundled its own browser with its Windows operating system to smother \\nNetscape's chances of marketing its browser. Now in the corridors \\noutside the antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape \\nhas found a new partner in America Online and has no need of protection \\nfrom the government. But it could be as easily argued that Microsoft \\nhas bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale \\nto America Online. Nor is it clear that customers of America Online \\nwill choose Netscape's browser as a vehicle for buying and selling \\non the Internet. Even in its newly musclebound form, America Online \\nremains dependent on Microsoft's good will for favorable placement \\nof an AOL icon on the main desktop screen. It may be that, years hence, \\nAmerica Online, Netscape and Sun will put together an alternative \\nmeans to the Internet through telephone lines, cables or the like. \\nBut until that day, fairness requires Justice Department action to \\ninsure that Microsoft not use its current position to thwart consumer \\nchoice. Only when companies know they can get their products to the \\nconsumer will they have the incentive to innovate and turn the Internet \\ninto the revolutionary medium it promises to be. \\n\", \"\\nCambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday \\nto stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls \\nillegal. Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, \\nand opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy \\nare out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman \\nHun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying \\nto make its members' return an international issue. Hun Sen's ruling \\nparty narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition \\n_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen \\nthe two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. \\nMeanwhile, it says, the old government is holding power illegally. \\nRanariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign \\nagainst the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo \\nSato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it. ``We respectfully \\nadvise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to \\nthe current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote. ``At \\nbest the current regime could be considered a caretaker government \\nas it has not been approved by the National Assembly.'' After a meeting \\nbetween Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen \\naide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for \\nthe opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international \\ncommunity may be asked for security guarantees. ``There have been \\nreports that there is an attempt to internationalize the return of \\nthose members of parliament on the excuse of security problems,'' \\nPrak Sokhonn said. ``Some (opposition politicians) have wanted the \\nUnited Nations to help guarantee a safe return for them.'' The U.N. \\nsecretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh provided monitors \\nto opposition politicians after they returned to Cambodia to participate \\nin the July election. The monitoring ended Sept. 30. ``Our office \\nhas not received any official request for that operation to be started \\nup again,'' U.N. diplomat Jonathan Prentice said Monday in reaction \\nto Prak Sokhonn's statement. The opposition has insisted that any \\nfurther talks on the next government must take place outside the country, \\nbut the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and \\nrecently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. \\nDiplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit \\nMonday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura \\nsaid King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy \\nto return to Cambodia. Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that \\nhe could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is \\nnow ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of \\nthe three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. \\n\\nWorried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, \\nopposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of \\nsecurity guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote \\nin a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the \\nfirst session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained \\nthat Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns \\nhis party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia. Hun \\nSen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' \\nsafety and their right to conduct political activities ``in accordance \\nwith the laws in force.'' Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's \\nstatement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining \\na promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were \\nfree from prosecution for their political activities during and after \\nlast July's election. Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, was \\nforced to take refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest \\nafter Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. \\nThe alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations \\norganized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party \\nnarrowly won the election. The opposition, alleging widespread fraud \\nand intimidation, refused to accept the results of the polls. Fearing \\nfor their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh \\nled an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament \\nwas ceremonially opened in late September. Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC \\nparty finished a close second in the election, returned last week \\nand struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. The \\nagreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president \\nof the National Assembly. The two parties have formed three working \\ngroups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment \\nof a Senate to be the upper house of parliament. Sok An, representing \\nHun Sen's party, said Friday that one working group had completed \\nits work on a joint political platform to be implemented by the new \\ngovernment. The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic \\nand judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying \\nHun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to \\nthe National Assembly. \\n\\nCambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands \\nfor talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' \\nthe political crisis. Government and opposition parties have asked \\nKing Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election \\nnegotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party \\nto form a new government failed. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom \\nRanariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition \\nfigures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not \\nnegotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence \\nin Beijing. Hun Sen, however, rejected that. ``I would like to make \\nit clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted \\nin the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet \\nmeeting on Friday. ``No-one should internationalize Cambodian affairs. \\nIt is detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia,'' he said. Hun Sen's \\nCambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in \\nJuly's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form \\na government on its own. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that \\nHun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread \\nfraud. They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election \\ncomplaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the \\nnational assembly moving and a new government formed. Hun Sen said \\non Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country \\nwas ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.'' Both Ranariddh and \\nSam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament was ceremonially \\nopened on Sep. 24. Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figures have \\nbeen under court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom \\nPenh residence on Sep. 7. Hun Sen was not home at the time of the \\nattack, which was followed by a police crackdown on demonstrators \\ncontesting Hun Sen's election victory. The Sam Rainsy Party, in a \\nstatement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to \\nmake any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock. ``A meeting \\noutside Cambodia, as suggested by the opposition, could place all \\nparties on more equal footing,'' said the statement. ``But the ruling \\nparty refuses to negotiate unless it is able to threaten its negotiating \\npartners with arrest or worse.'' \\n\\nKing Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's \\ntop two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition \\ngovernment led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news \\nagencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements \\nsigned Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party \\nin firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. \\n``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly \\nbring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. \\nUncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC \\nPresident Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government \\nat a summit convened by Sihanouk. The deal, which will make Hun Sen \\nprime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended \\nmore than three months of political deadlock that followed a July \\nelection narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation \\nof a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President \\nChea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly. Sihanouk, recalling \\nprocedures used in a past government, suggested Tuesday that he should \\nappoint the first two members of the upper house. The remaining senators, \\nhe said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government \\nand the National Assembly. Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC \\nhad agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat \\nNational Assembly. Other details of the Senate, including how much \\npower it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet \\nto be ironed out by the two parties. \\n\\nCambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader \\nin the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's \\nhuman rights record. The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding \\nresolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives \\ncalling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian \\nlaw allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution \\ninclude Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince \\nNorodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against \\nanti-government demonstrations. A copy of the resolution has since \\nbeen submitted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. \\n``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely \\nand realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice \\nto the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' \\nthe party said in a statement. It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh \\nas a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate \\nthe defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels. It also repeated claims \\nthat the prince's party had moved rebel soldiers into Phnom Penh, \\na contention that remains unproved. The killings of nearly 100 of \\nRanariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in \\nthe aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications \\nmeant to distort the political situation. Ranariddh and his core supporters \\ndid not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in \\nJuly this year that the ruling party narrowly won. Ranariddh and his \\nopposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refused to accept the election results, \\nalleging widespread intimidation and fraud by the CPP. When their \\nclaims were dismissed by a Hun Sen-friendly court, they rallied their \\nsupporters into the streets of Phnom Penh. After two weeks of tolerating \\nthe demonstrations, Hun Sen ordered a violent crackdown that resulted \\nin the deaths of at least four protesters. U.N. human rights workers \\nlater discovered more than 20 bodies _ many bearing signs of torture \\n_ in and around the capital, prompting speculation that the death \\ntoll could be much higher. The ruling party supported the police action \\nin its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters \\nand that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested \\nin a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at \\nHun Sen. The opposition claims the grenade attack was staged as an \\nexcuse to begin the crackdown. ``The leaders of illegal demonstrations \\nare the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving \\nfrom the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly \\nviolence as ``minor incidents.'' The ruling party also reminded the \\nUnited States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government \\ndominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. The Khmer Rouge \\nwas responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people during \\nthe guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of Cambodia. After a series of \\nborder clashes, the Khmer Rouge was ousted from power by an invading \\nVietnamese army that set up a surrogate Cambodian communist government \\nlater led by Hun Sen. The ruling party accused U.S. policy-makers \\nof not taking timely action to save the Cambodian people from the \\nKhmer Rouge. ``They must not make unjust accusations against those \\nwho led the struggle to liberate the people from genocide,'' it added. \\n\\nCambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency \\nof Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must \\noccupy the top position in the legislative body. Disputes over the \\npresidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the \\ntwo-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form \\na new government. Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has \\noffered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC \\nparty of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. The \\nprince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said \\nsuch a scenario was unconstitutional. ``Co-sharing anything with the \\nCPP means surrendering full power to them. Furthermore, such a proposal \\nis unconstitutional,'' the faxed statement said. The royalist party \\nalso rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that \\nRanariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included. ``No party with \\nseats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency \\nand a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the \\nstatement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given \\nchairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions. Noting \\nthat FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its \\nwin in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its \\nturn to take the post. In the most recent elections, held in July, \\nHun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was \\nshort of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. \\nFearing arrest, many opposition members of Parliament left Cambodia \\nafter the ceremonial opening of the National Assembly on Sep. 24. \\nA series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed. The \\ntalks have been complicated by the CPP-FUNCINPEC quarrel over the \\nParliament's top job. Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh \\nto return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make \\nan ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a \\ngovernment. FUNCINPEC has demanded from Hun Sen written guarantees \\nfor the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for \\nre-entering negotiations. \\n\\nCambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock \\nFriday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun \\nSen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. In a \\nlong-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh \\nwill become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed \\nelections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of \\n64 seats in the 122-member chamber. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party \\ndropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh \\nand party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker. It was one of the main \\nstumbling blocks in months of discord. Instead, Sihanouk announced, \\nthe constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea \\nSim will head. Chea Sim will still serve as acting head of state during \\nthe king's frequent absences from the country. ``The major political \\ncrisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock \\nfacing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his \\nstatement. The Senate will initially be appointed by the king. The \\nagreement did not say how many seats there would be, nor how they \\nwould be divided. The parties will hammer out details later. Pok Than, \\none of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly \\nadvisory role to the assembly. The senior Senate leaders will join \\nthose of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two \\nBuddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that \\nwill choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies. The two parties \\nsaid that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25. The agreement \\ncame surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from \\nThailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures \\nfor weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. \\nThe deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the \\nCPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors \\nand businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which \\nis in desperate need of aid. It could also hasten Cambodia's entry \\ninto the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last \\nyear after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody \\ncoup. Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second \\nday of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form \\na coalition and made ``important concessions.'' The king, the sole \\nforce in Cambodian politics able to broker a deal, pressured both \\nsides to reach agreement before he leaves Saturday for medical treatment \\nin Beijing. Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to \\na request by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political \\npardons. All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that \\nare widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has powers to grant \\npardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically sensitive \\ncases. Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been \\nat loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections \\nin July. The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed \\nlast year's coup. The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed \\nto form a government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally \\nSam Rainsy held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud \\nand intimidation. The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh \\nseeking Hun Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. Sam Rainsy, \\nunder investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his role in the demonstrations, \\nhas remained abroad. His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant \\nto forming a working government. \\n\\nCambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership \\nbetween the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom \\nRanariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. \\nHun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in \\n1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over \\npower-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling \\nKhmer Rouge. Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen \\nousted Ranariddh in a coup. The prince fled Cambodia and did not return \\nuntil a few months before elections in July. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's \\nParty narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by \\nRanariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election \\nnegotiations. After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to \\na coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh \\npresident of the National Assembly. ``This will not be a repetition \\nof 1993 because there will not be two prime ministers,'' said Hun \\nSen aide Prak Sokhon, who attended last week's summit. ``When we had \\ntwo prime ministers, everything moved very slowly and decisions were \\nmade more politically than technically.'' Ranariddh said Saturday \\nthat the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and \\ndefense under co-ministers. Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya \\nrevealed Monday that it was also agreed that the CPP would control \\nthe foreign affairs and finance portfolios. FUNCINPEC will take justice \\nand information. The parties are to form working groups this week \\nto divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment \\nto form a new Senate. Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet \\nNov. 23 _ two days before parliament reopens _ to review the results \\nof the working groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said. \\nTheir ability to repair their relationship and work together will \\nbe the key to a stable coalition. ``I consider this a remarriage,'' \\nAhmad Yahya said. ``They have to be careful with the way they work \\nand what they say. They will have to compromise to achieve results.'' \\nRanariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party placed a distant third in \\nthe election, was left out of last week's deal. Sam Rainsy, a virulent \\ncritic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14 other members of parliament \\nhave remained outside Cambodia since September amid fears for their \\nsecurity. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam \\nRainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on \\nsecurity, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening \\nof parliament. Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that \\nhis party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by \\nHun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. \\nAuthorities have called it an assassination attempt on Hun Sen. A \\npolice general investigating the attack said Monday that likely suspects \\nhave been identified, but he would not reveal names or their political \\naffiliation. \\n\\nKing Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's \\ntop political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress \\nin deadlocked negotiations to form a government. Cambodian leader \\nHun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on \\nthe monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. \\n``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three \\nparties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such \\na meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an \\nOct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the \\nsenior opposition FUNCINPEC party. A copy of the letter was obtained \\nThursday. In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises \\nto end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to \\ntake responsibility before the nation and the people.'' Hun Sen used \\nThursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil \\nwar to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with \\nhis party. ``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability \\nprevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised \\nspeech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Hun \\nSen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national \\nelection, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government \\non its own. Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance \\nminister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with \\nHun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly \\ninvestigated. International monitors said the election was relatively \\nfree and fair. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in \\npower as long as the opposition refused to form a new one. Ranariddh \\nand Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 \\nceremonial convening of parliament. Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest \\nopposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, \\nRanariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating \\ninside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence \\nin Beijing. Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying \\nit would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country. Negotiations \\nso far have proved fruitless except for the opening of parliament \\nafter a Sept. 22 summit led by the king. Hun Sen implied Thursday \\nthat the opposition failed to follow through on promises made at the \\nsummit. ``If those results are strictly respected, there seems no \\nreason to hold another summit,'' Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary \\nof the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Sihanouk is reportedly set to fly \\nto Beijing next month to receive medical treatment from his Chinese \\ndoctors. The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety ailments and \\nperiodically makes extended trips to Beijing. He was diagnosed with \\ncolon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into remission. In September, \\nthousands of people filled the streets of Phnom Penh to protest against \\nthe alleged election fraud. Hun Sen ordered police to break up the \\ndemonstrations. At least four demonstrators were killed by police, \\nbut the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted \\nspeculation that the death tally could be much higher. In his speech, \\nHun Sen blamed the violence on opposition leaders, saying the demonstrations \\ninstigated social and economic chaos. \\n\\nCambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom \\nof all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they \\nwill be arrested or killed if they return to the country. The assurances \\nwere aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun \\nSen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices \\nin September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind \\na plot against his life. Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament \\nfrom his party have been holed up overseas for two months. But a deal \\nreached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, \\non forming a new government last week has opened the door for their \\nreturn. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father \\nand Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, \\nHun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied \\nto all politicians. His assurances come a week before the first session \\nof Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy said \\nWednesday that he was unsatisfied with the guarantee. He said it contained \\nindirect language and loopholes that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy \\nParty members are still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling \\nparty. ``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members \\nof the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' \\nthe opposition leader said in a statement. ``But instead they make \\nroundabout statements, full of loopholes that can easily be exploited \\nby a legal system that is completely in their control.'' Ranariddh \\ntold reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe for Sam Rainsy \\nin Cambodia. Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, \\nthe prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning \\nof ministries in the new coalition government. Last week, Hun Sen's \\nCambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to \\nform a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and \\nmake the prince president of the National Assembly. The deal assures \\nthe two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. \\nThe men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh \\nin a coup last year. ``I think Hun Sen has got everything. He's got \\nthe premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition \\nfrom his majesty the king. I don't think there is any benefit for \\nHun Sen to cause instability for our country,'' Ranariddh said. The \\nprince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be \\ngiven back his previous position as the second-ranking general in \\nthe Cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's outnumbered \\nforces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to \\nlast year's coup. \\n\", \"\\nTrying to deflect foreign criticism of a crackdown on democracy campaigners, \\nChina sent a respected labor rights activist from jail into U.S. exile \\nSunday even as it prepared to put a prominent dissident on trial. \\nXu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive \\na nascent opposition political party of a potent organizer and a moderate \\nvoice. He is the third and most influential leader in the China Democracy \\nParty tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at least 32 members \\ndetained or questioned. For organizing the party and thereby challenging \\nthe ruling Communist Party, Xu, 55, is accused of subverting state \\npower, a crime punishable by 10 years to life in prison. To prevent \\nsupporters from rallying outside Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's \\nCourt, police detained two of Xu's colleagues Sunday and kept watch \\non the homes of at least two others, friends and a Hong Kong-based \\nrights group reported. As police moved against Xu's friends, labor \\nrights campaigner Liu Nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside \\nBeijing and, with his wife and daughter, was put on a plane to Canada \\nand then New York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years. \\nAuthorities released Liu on medical parole five months before the \\nend of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother, exiled \\ndemocracy campaigner Liu Qing. His wife claimed for two years that \\nLiu's health was worsening. But only last month did authorities grant \\na comprehensive exam. Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, in \\nthe 50-year-old's mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. The timing \\nof Liu's exile and Xu's trial was the most brazen in a string of high-profile \\ndissident releases calculated to influence Western governments. Human \\nrights groups immediately denounced Liu's release as cynical and manipulative. \\n``The Chinese government continues to play hostage politics with no \\ntrue commitment to international human rights standards,'' said Xiao \\nQiang of Human Rights in China, a New York-based lobbying group that \\nLiu Qing heads. Over the past two years, as China tried to woo the \\nWest, Beijing signed two key U.N. rights treaties and won praise for \\nbringing its spotty legal system closer to international standards. \\nThe ruling Communist Party relaxed some controls on dissenting views \\namong academics. Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in \\nthe more open atmosphere. Over the past six months, dissidents in \\n14 provinces and cities have tried to use Chinese laws to set up and \\nregister the China Democracy Party. In a sign of the opposition party's \\nappeal, 205 dissidents from across China issued a petition Sunday \\ncalling for the immediate release of Xu and two other leaders, the \\nHong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic \\nMovement in China reported. To wipe out the opposition movement, authorities \\nhave violated recently revised laws that are supposed to protect the \\nrights of criminal suspects. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin \\nYongmin to trial with less than four days notice given to their families, \\ninstead of the 10 required by law. Qin and a third principal organizer, \\nWang Youcai, were also denied legal counsel. Police detained or scared \\noff prospective lawyers, forcing the two to argue their own defenses \\nin separate trials on Thursday. No verdicts have been announced. The \\nBeijing court appointed Xu a lawyer, but his wife, He Xintong, suspects \\nit is merely a formality in what she expects to be a show trial. ``He \\nhasn't even read the whole indictment. How is he going to represent \\nmy husband?'' He Xintong said after talking with the lawyer and his \\naide. Authorities have turned down requests by Xu's colleagues to \\nattend the trial, and He said she has been given one pass, for herself. \\nXu edited an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall movement \\n20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of them in solitary \\nconfinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu has played the role \\nof elder adviser to dissidents. He became openly involved in the China \\nDemocracy Party in November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing \\nand nearby Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party \\nmembers and exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress. \\n\\nBy sentencing two of the country's most prominent democracy campaigners \\nto long prison terms, China on Monday took its harshest steps yet \\nin its current crackdown on organized political opposition. After \\na trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 \\nthe dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent \\n12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 \\nyears for ``subversion of state power.'' Xu's alleged crimes included \\nhelping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to Communist \\nrule in interviews with foreign journalists, calling for independent \\nlabor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident \\nabroad. He was defended by a lawyer who was appointed by the court \\njust four days ago and met his client only once. Also sentenced Monday, \\nto 11 years in prison, was Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy \\nParty, which has now been suppressed. Wang was tried on subversion \\ncharges on Thursday in a brief court session, with no defense lawyer, \\nin the eastern city of Hangzhou. The punishment of a third veteran \\ndemocracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, has not been announced. His \\ntrial began in the central city of Wuhan on Thursday and may reconvene \\non Tuesday, relatives said. A similarly long sentence is expected. \\nMonday's sentences, which came just six months after President Clinton's \\nvisit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leaders to \\nmove quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the \\nState Department. They also appeared to spell the effective end here \\nof the China Democracy Party, which these three men, along with hundreds \\nof lesser-known individuals, tried to organize in recent months. The \\nlong sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals \\nhere that China's warming relations with the United States in recent \\nyears and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring \\na significant easing of political controls. Xu was tried Monday morning \\nin the Beijing Intermediate Court. When after a brief recess the three-judge \\npanel announced his 13-year sentence, Xu stood up and shouted, ``I \\nprotest!'' said his wife of 28 years, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He \\nand lawyers who were present, he shouted that the judges were unfair \\nand that he would not appeal his case because the proceedings were \\nillegitimate. With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government \\nhas silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one \\nwho has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy. Xu first \\ncame to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement of the late \\n1970s, then served 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. \\nIn the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak out \\nand making constant use of fax machines and e-mail, he and Qin tried \\nto draw attention to China's obligations under two international covenants \\nit has signed _ one on economic and cultural rights, and one on civil \\nand political rights. In the face of several temporary detentions \\nand stiff warnings, they continued their activities. Wang, in contrast, \\nfirst became involved in dissident activities in 1989, while a graduate \\nstudent in physics in Beijing, when he became a leader of the Tiananmen \\nSquare demonstrations. After the student movement was smashed by the \\narmy, he was on the most-wanted list, then was arrested and spent \\ntwo years in prison. During Clinton's visit to China in June, Wang \\nannounced the formation of the China Democracy Party. Hundreds around \\nthe country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting the idea. But while \\nthe government has allowed somewhat freer discussion of political \\ntopics in universities and obscure journals in the last year, it has \\nnot allowed any challenges _ in print or in the form of organized \\ngroups _ to the principle of Communist Party rule. In a speech on \\nFriday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms, the president and \\nCommunist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized the primacy of the \\nparty, saying, ``The Western mode of political systems must never \\nbe adopted.'' After learning of Monday's sentences, the American Embassy \\nhere, which has spent the last two years building improved relations \\nbetween China and the United States, issued a strong condemnation \\nof what it termed the ``deplorable decisions.'' ``We are deeply disappointed \\nwith both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh sentences,'' \\nthe statement said. ``No individual should be arrested, tried and \\nsentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including \\nthose guaranteed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political \\nRights, to which China has committed itself.'' Like Thursday's trials, \\nboth of which proceeded with no defense attorneys because prospective \\nlawyers had been warned off by police or detained, Monday's proceeding \\nshowed that in cases involving security issues, police and courts \\ncould write their own rules. According to the criminal procedure law, \\ndefendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial, but \\nXu was told only four days ago that his trial would be Monday. His \\nwife, who until Monday had not been allowed to contact him since his \\narrest on Nov. 30, was told three days ago. Under the law, defendants \\nalso have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but Xu was assigned \\na lawyer by the court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, \\nthe lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only for one brief meeting, \\nan associate of Mo's said. Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before \\nthe trial. ``Meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the \\nwhole charade,'' she said in a telephone interview this weekend. Responding \\nto the accusations during Monday morning's trial, Xu's lawyer argued \\nthat Xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his own views and \\nthat this could not amount to subversive activities against the state, \\nan associate of the lawyer said. But in a decision that was clearly \\npreordained, the court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend \\nwhat may be much of the rest of his life in prison. Born in 1943 in \\nthe southeastern province of Jiangxi, Xu was interested in politics \\neven as a teen-ager, his wife said. In the 1960s, as an idealistic \\nMarxist, he decided to get his learning in society rather than attend \\na university. He served in the navy for five years, then became an \\nelectrician with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with \\nthe democracy movement and going to prison. On Monday afternoon, in \\na police station hours after the trial finished, Xu was allowed a \\nhalf-hour with his wife. ``He told me he'd be able to handle the pain,'' \\nshe later recounted in a telephone interview. ``He said that this \\nwould give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what \\nhas happened.'' Ms. He, who has been married to Xu since 1971, said \\nshe expected to see him in monthly visits to prison. The couple has \\na daughter, Xu Jin, who is a graduate student in fine arts at Boston \\nUniversity. In an earlier interview, soon after her husband was arrested \\non Nov. 30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, ``I can't change the way \\nI am.'' If he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should \\ngo on and enjoy her life. ``And if I die,'' Xu said as they parted \\nthat day, ``please plant a tree for me.'' \\n\\nHours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty \\nand host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent \\nhuman rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest \\nrun-in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in \\na week to legally register a human rights monitoring group. Qin said \\na civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan \\naccused him of engaging in illegal activities. The police came soon \\nafter he returned home. ``As I'm sending this statement, the Wuhan \\nPublic Security Bureau is again taking me away,'' Qin said in a hastily \\nscrawled message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporters. \\nQin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about three \\nhours before being released and threatened with prosecution if he \\npersisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer. Qin \\nhoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International \\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities \\ndon't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting \\nhuman rights to the last.'' China plans to sign the International \\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. \\nBy the time the ink is dry, Blair should be landing in Beijing on \\nTuesday morning for the first visit by a British prime minister in \\nseven years. The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedoms of speech \\nand assembly. But even after China signs, the treaty would not come \\ninto force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservations \\neffectively nullifying some provisions. Blair has vowed to discuss \\ndifferences over human rights with Chinese leaders. His visit has \\ndrawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group \\nurging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners. \\nIn an open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leaders \\nsay they respect human rights principles, in law and practice the \\ngovernment allows rights abuses and persecution of dissidents. Thousands \\nof political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons, \\nlabor camps or detention centers, said the letter, a copy of which \\nwas released by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights \\nand Democratic Movement in China. The letter called for the release \\nof Shi Binhai, a journalist who compiled a popular book on political \\nchange; Fang Jue, a businessman who called openly for political reform; \\nand other imprisoned activists. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders \\nurged Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu \\nJingsheng. The three are among 13 journalists imprisoned ``simply \\nfor attempting to practice their profession,'' it said in a statement. \\n\\nSix months after President Clinton traveled to Beijing and challenged \\nChina's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's \\npolicy of engaging Beijing was called into question Monday when Chinese \\ncourts sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to \\nlong jail sentences. Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human rights \\ngroups said the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of \\nthe administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties \\nwith China in hopes of democratic reform. The dissidents _ Xu Wenli, \\nwho was sentenced Monday to 13 years in prison, Wang Youcai, who received \\nan 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who was reported to have received \\n12 years were charged with subversion. The State Department said it \\nhad received reports from sources it did not identify that a third \\nleading democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, had been sentenced to 13 \\nyears in prison after a trial last week in the city of Wuhan. Relatives \\nof Qin in China denied the reports, however, and said that his trial \\ncontinued. Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leaders \\nduring his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration found itself \\non the defensive Monday and harshly criticized the prison sentences, \\neven as it continued to insist that the administration's policy of \\nengagement was helping push Beijing toward democracy. James Foley, \\na State Department spokesman, said the United States ``deeply deplores'' \\nthe jail terms and called for the immediate release of the dissidents. \\n``These three men appear to have been involved in nothing more than \\nefforts to form a new political party,'' he said. While condemning \\nthe prison sentences, Foley and other American officials were careful \\nto note the administration's assessment that there had been progress \\nin human rights in China, some of it linked to Clinton's meeting in \\nBeijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. ``There had been improvements \\nin the human rights situation in China, modest improvements,'' Foley \\nsaid. The severe prison terms _ and other recent instances of harassment \\nof democracy campaigners in China _ are ``steps backward in relationship \\nto what had been an improved human rights performance,'' he said. \\nCritics of the administration's China policy noted that the long prison \\nsentences were handed out less than a week after Jiang delivered a \\npointed speech in Beijing in which he made clear that China's economic \\nreforms were not a prelude to Western-style democracy. ``The Western \\nmode of political systems must never be copied,'' he said, adding \\nthat those who challenged the Communist Party's supremacy would be \\ncrushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has long been among China's \\nharshest critics in Congress, said the prison sentences handed out \\nto Xu and Wang were ``the clearest demonstration'' since the president's \\nvisit to China last summer of Beijing's ``true intentions regarding \\nhuman rights.'' ``They are pathetic, really pathetic,'' she said of \\nthe administration. ``The administration can say what it wants, but \\nit must know Monday that its policy on China is an embarrassment. \\nWhat the Chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in \\nthe world.'' Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights \\nGroup, said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration \\nto revise its China policy, which he described as ``almost entirely'' \\ndriven by the administration's desire to encourage trade. He said \\nthat while there had been some signs of progress in the human rights \\nsituation in China over the last year _ notably, China's agreement \\nto sign international treaties on civil and economic rights _ the \\noverall picture was bleak. ``On balance,'' he said, ``any progress \\nChina has made by allowing greater openness may have been canceled \\nout by a more repressive attitude.'' Human Rights Watch, the largest \\nAmerican-based human rights group, called on the administration to \\nconsider postponing or canceling a planned visit to China early next \\nyear by Commerce Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation \\nas a protest over the prison sentences. ``That would get Beijing's \\nattention,'' Jendrzejczck said. Other China experts and scholars insisted \\nthat the administration was right to continue its policy of engagement \\nwith China, and that there was reason to believe that political reform \\nwould follow economic reform, as Clinton has argued. Peter Rodman, \\na former Nixon and Reagan administration official now at the Nixon \\nCenter in Washington, said that ``the United States cannot control \\nthe evolution of a society as complex as China's.'' He said the harsh \\nprison sentences given out Monday to the dissidents were to be expected, \\nespecially since Xu and Wang had been involved in trying to set up \\na political party to challenge the Communists. ``The pattern of this \\nregime is that every once in a while, they ease up a bit and somebody \\ngoes too far and there's a crisis,'' he said. ``I don't think you \\ncan blame the United States for this crackdown, nor can you give us \\ncredit for any political reforms. On human rights, I just don't think \\nthere's much more we can do.'' \\n\\nIn stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown on dissidents, Chinese \\ncourts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners to 13 and 11 \\nyears in prison Monday for trying to organize an opposition political \\nparty. The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial \\nin Beijing was the longest for a Chinese dissident in three years. \\nHis colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced \\nto 11 years, in a verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four days \\nafter his trial. Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition \\ngroup of a potent organizer and the fractured dissident community \\nat large of a strong and moderating voice. Xu remained defiant during \\nhis tightly controlled trial on subversion charges. He refused to \\nanswer questions from prosecutors and judges and responded only to \\nthose from his lawyer, the court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, \\nsaid. When the court asked if he would appeal, ``Xu Wenli said he \\nwould not appeal,'' Mo said, quoting his client as saying ``this is \\npolitical persecution.'' Xu's daughter also criticized the verdict. \\n``All he wanted to do was to advocate free speech and make sure the \\nparty registers peacefully. But the government failed this test, and \\nnow my father has to go to jail again for it,'' said daughter Xu Jin, \\na graduate student at Boston University. Security forces have orchestrated \\na concerted crackdown, trampling China's slim legal safeguards to \\ncrush the China Democracy Party. In three weeks, at least 32 people \\nhave been detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading \\nmember, Qin Yongmin, have been put on trial. All three were charged \\nwith trying to subvert China's Communist Party-led system. Xu and \\nQin were given less than four days to prepare their defenses. Last \\nThursday, Wang and Qin faced trials without legal counsel after police \\ndetained or scared off potential lawyers. No verdict has been announced \\nin Qin's case. Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang \\nplotted subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party \\nin both cities and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua \\nNews Agency said in a rare mention of dissident activities. The courts \\nruled the two should be ``severely punished'' as repeat offenders, \\nXinhua said in an indirect reference to their previous democracy campaigning. \\nWary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, scores of uniformed and \\nplainclothes police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's \\nCourt Monday for Xu's trial. Foreign reporters were kept 500 meters \\n(yards) away from the building. Xu's wife was the only friend or family \\nmember given permission to watch the proceedings, along with an audience \\nselected by court officials. She was escorted from her home to the \\ncourthouse by three plainclothes officers. Hours after the verdict, \\nHe Xintong still had not returned home nor had she contacted her daughter. \\nPolice detained at least two of Xu's democracy party colleagues and \\nkept watch on the houses of others. ``Members of the China Democracy \\nParty will struggle to the end for the realization of democracy,'' \\nsaid Gao Hongmin, whose home was under surveillance. Gao, who helped \\nXu organize the party's Beijing branch, said authorities would not \\nbe able to arrest all the party's supporters. In just six months, \\nthe party attracted enough of a following to try to register branches \\nin 14 provinces and cities. The U.S. government and exiled dissidents, \\nmany of whom supported the party's efforts, denounced the sentences \\nand called for the dissidents' release. ``We are deeply disappointed \\nwith both the guilty verdict and the extremely harsh sentence given \\nto Mr. Xu,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. ``No individual \\nshould be arrested, tried or sentenced for exercising internationally \\nrecognized freedoms.'' Xu, 55, edited an underground journal in the \\nDemocracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, \\nmostly in solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, \\nhe has been behind-the-scenes advisor to a host of dissident activities. \\nHe supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, in setting \\nup an independent human rights monitor and advised others to run for \\nlocal legislative seats in Beijing. Xu became openly involved in the \\nChina Democracy Party in November. Wang Youcai, a student leader of \\nthe Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989 and now 32, \\npublicly declared the China Democracy Party's formation in June and \\nsaid the group intended to challenge the Communist Party's 49-year \\nban on opposition politics. Police have sporadically detained supporters \\nof the democracy party. The decisive move came on Nov. 30 as Chinese \\nCommunist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned from Japan, ending a busy \\ntwo years of diplomatic forays. In a speech broadcast nationwide on \\nFriday, Jiang warned against subversives trying to bring down the \\nsystem and vowed never to copy Western democracy. To allay international \\ncriticism, China released a respected labor rights campaigner, Liu \\nNianchun, from 3 1/2 years in prison camps on Sunday and sent him \\ninto exile in the United States. \\n\\nGerman Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently \\nby meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing \\nof two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international \\ntreaty the country recently signed. ``The reaction of Chinese authorities \\nis totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' \\nimmediate release. ``The accused simply tried through peaceful means \\nto exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed \\nby China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International \\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, \\nFischer said in a statement. Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu \\nWenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an \\nopposition political party. \\n\\nGerman Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently \\nby meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing \\nof two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international \\ntreaty the country recently signed. ``The reaction of Chinese courts \\nis totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' \\nimmediate release. ``The accused simply tried through peaceful means \\nto exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed \\nby China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International \\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, \\nFischer said in a statement. Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu \\nWenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an \\nopposition political party. \\n\\nThe trials of three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader \\nJiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China will sustain a crackdown \\non dissent throughout next year. In his second hard-line speech in \\nsix days, Jiang vowed to crush any challenges to Communist Party rule \\nand preserve social stability. He demanded that officials ``talk politics'' \\n_ a euphemism for following party orders. The speech, to senior law \\nenforcement officials, used uncompromising language heard less frequently \\nover the past 18 months as Chinese leaders sought to improve relations \\nabroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuated the summary trials and convictions \\nfor subversion this week of three political critics who tried to form \\nan opposition party. To underscore the party's intolerant mood, national \\nnewspapers ran brief accounts Tuesday and Wednesday of the 13-, 12- \\nand 11-year prison terms given to Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai. \\nDissidents are rarely mentioned by official media, and the reports \\nserved as a warning to China's 1.2 billion people. In the speech, \\nreported by state television, Jiang said stability was crucial over \\nthe next year. He noted two key events on the political calendar: \\nthe 50th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct. 1 and China's \\nrecovery of the Portuguese colony of Macau on Dec. 20. ``We must strengthen \\nthe ideological and political education of officials and raise their \\nawareness of and resistance to the sabotaging acts of hostile domestic \\nand foreign forces,'' China Central Television quoted Jiang as saying. \\n``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its head, \\nit must be resolutely nipped in the bud.'' Jiang did not exclusively \\ntarget political enemies. He likened their threat to that of white-collar \\nand ordinary criminals and ticked off a list of potentially volatile \\nproblems _ inefficient state industries, legions of laid-off workers, \\nstagnating farmers' incomes and corrupt officials. The emphasis on \\nstability and warnings to those who would disrupt it were reminiscent \\nof party pronouncements in the waning years of Jiang's mentor, Deng \\nXiaoping. After Deng died in 1997 and Jiang emerged victorious from \\na major party conclave, he projected a more confident image. Reform, \\nnot stability, were the bywords of the past year. Academic debates \\nover the past year were the boldest in 10 years by China's relatively \\ncontrolled standards. Party leaders too touted efforts to build a \\nmore comprehensive, predictable legal system and won praise from Western \\ngovernments for signing U.N. rights treaties. ``Our active developments \\nof foreign affairs has reached new achievements,'' Jiang said. ``Our \\ncountry's stature has risen a step higher.'' By arresting and convicting \\nXu, Qin and Wang in less than three weeks, China trampled its own \\nlegal safeguards for criminal suspects and raised questions about \\nits commitments to U.N. rights treaties it signed over the past 15 \\nmonths. Despite the swift punishments given the three, dissidents \\nhave continued to campaign for justice. Four elder members of the \\ndissident community sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan \\nand U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson calling on China \\nto stop persecuting political critics and release political prisoners. \\n``We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock'' over \\nthe long sentences given Xu, Qin and Wang and the recent detentions \\nof several other Chinese, the four wrote in a letter dated Tuesday \\nthat was released by New York-based Human Rights in China on Wednesday. \\nIn addition, 214 dissidents in China planned a 100-day series of rotating \\n24-hour fasts beginning Thursday to protest the sentences, the Information \\nCenter of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Wednesday \\nnight. The fasts were to have begun with lawyer Wang Wenjiang, whom \\nauthorities prevented from representing Wang Youcai, and Wang Zechen \\nin Liaoning province in northeastern China, but the two activists \\nwere detained by police Wednesday evening, the Hong Kong-based center \\nsaid. The British ambassador in Beijing, Tony Galsworthy, and others \\ndelivered a protest message to the Chinese government demanding the \\nimmediate release of Xu, Qin and Wang, the Foreign Office in London \\nconfirmed on Wednesday. It was conveyed on behalf of the European \\nUnion, the United States, Canada and Norway. \\n\\nChina released a respected, but ailing labor rights campaigner from \\na prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the \\nUnited States. Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by \\nthe government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming \\ntrial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu is the third leading member \\nof a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion \\nin a three-week crackdown that has seen at least 32 dissidents arrested \\nor interrogated. Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China \\nDemocracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending \\nthe trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was \\nfree, human rights groups decried the Chinese government's timing \\nas manipulative. ``We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese \\ngovernment for this cynical game it is playing,'' said Xiao Qiang, \\ndirector of New York-based Human Rights in China. After 3 1/2 years \\nin prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts \\nof Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian \\nAir flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother \\nsaid. Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their \\n11-year-old daughter, the family said. Liu Nianchun's release follows \\nthe same pattern China used in freeing its two most famous dissidents, \\nWei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997 and Wang Dan in April. Authorities released \\nLiu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison \\nterm, provided he go into exile, said his brother and exiled democracy \\ncampaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for \\nat least two years. In an exam authorities finally agreed to provide \\nlast month, doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach \\nand bowels, Liu Qing said. Like Wang and Wei, the United States and \\nother Western governments have lobbied China to release Liu. Chinese \\nleaders have been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout \\nthe 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence among \\ndissidents at home. In the only official comment on the release, the \\nXinhua News Agency reported that judicial departments took into account \\nLiu's health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole \\nfor medical treatment. ``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at \\nthe same time sending people directly from prison into exile is a \\ntype of human rights violation and persecution,'' Liu Qing said in \\na telephone interview from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough. \\nLiu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in the fractured, \\npersecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2 years in prisons \\nand labor camps was a sad illustration of the way China's Communist \\nParty rulers punish people they deem a threat. Liu was imprisoned \\nthree times in the past 17 years. His last arrest came after he signed \\na petition calling for labor rights in May 1995. Liu was never put \\non trial. Fourteen months passed before his wife, Chu Hailan, first \\nlearned of his fate and whereabouts: a three-year spell in a labor \\ncamp in the frigid, remote northeast. His term was the maximum police \\nmay impose on criminal suspects without trial. Labor camp officials \\nlater extended Liu's sentence by a year for trying to escape, a charge \\nChu claimed was fabricated. Inside the labor camp, Liu once started \\na hunger strike to protest his treatment. He was beaten with cattle \\nprods and confined to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where \\nhe could only sit or stand. His wife endured police harassment, beatings \\nand detentions in campaigning for his release. Chu was dragged away \\nand hit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N. \\nhuman rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in September. \\n\\nHis friend and political mentor is jailed, robbing their budding opposition \\npolitical party of its most potent organizer, but Zha Jianguo is not \\nafraid. A bag packed with toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lies \\nready at his Beijing home for the day Chinese police take him away. \\nHe has told police interrogators he expects to be jailed, likely for \\na few years less than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu \\nWenli on Monday. ``Democracy is a process, and in that process a small \\nnumber of people will be sacrificed,'' Zha, a 47-year-old former manager \\nof a computer design company and vice chairman of the party's Beijing \\nbranch, told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. ``We want \\nto use our sacrifice to arouse the people, and we believe that sacrifice \\nis worthwhile.'' With a mixture of defiance and cool clarity about \\nthe chances for success, Zha said he and other China Democracy Party \\nmembers will continue organizing and campaigning for change. His tenacity \\nholds despite the summary trials and harsh punishments for Xu, Wang \\nYoucai and Qin Yongmin _ prominent party principals from the provinces \\nwho were sentenced to 11 and 12 years _ and despite threatening signs \\nfrom the ruling Communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned \\nin a speech published Wednesday that political subversives threatened \\nwhat he called China's fragile social order. ``Whenever any element \\nthat undermines stability raises its head, it must be resolutely nipped \\nin the bud,'' Jiang said. Zha maintains that such tactics are unnecessary. \\nIn its manifestoes, the Democracy Party espoused peaceful means to \\ntarget ``the undemocratic system, not the political power of the Communist \\nParty.'' ``We believe elections held after the establishment of a \\ndemocratic system should decide who has the power,'' said Zha. What \\nmany the world over consider democracy is legally subversive in China \\nfor threatening the Communist Party-led system. In the past month, \\nauthorities have arrested and convicted Xu, Qin and Wang and detained \\nor interrogated at least 29 other party members. Police took Zha from \\nhis home Sunday afternoon and held him for nearly 24 hours to keep \\nhim from Xu's trial. Until the crackdown, the China Democracy Party \\ndistinguished itself from past attempts at opposition by its openness. \\nOrganizers publicly announced their intention to set up the party. \\nThey tried to register with authorities. Statements were faxed to \\nforeign media and human rights groups to circumvent China's state-controlled \\nmedia. Now, the party's members _ about 500 by Zha's count _ are being \\ndriven underground. Party members will concentrate on increasing ranks \\nand will be more guarded in the use of telephones and faxes and their \\noccasional meetings, Zha said. ``If Xu and the other two were the \\nfirst round, then the second round is very likely and it will be bigger,'' \\nZha said. ``In such an unbalanced contest, we are forced to use more \\nsecretive means.'' The arrests of Xu, Wang and Qin deprive the party \\nof its more influential members, Zha said. All had proven track records, \\nXu and Qin as dissident editors in the Democracy Wall era movement \\n20 years ago, Wang as a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy \\ndemonstrations in 1989. ``But from another aspect, this has strengthened \\nthe resolve of even more party members to struggle on,'' Zha said \\nof the arrests. Zha got interested in politics as a radical youth, \\nfollowing Mao Tse-tung's appeals to go to the countryside in 1968. \\nWhen he returned to Beijing in 1989, he marched in the Tiananmen protests \\nand continued his activism. Friends introduced him to Xu Wenli in \\n1995. Having been released from prison two years before, Xu was still \\nnot openly involved in dissident politics, but he held court in his \\nBeijing home to discuss China's future. \\n\", \"\\nThe United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President \\nSlobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless \\nhe takes decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the \\nsouthern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put \\nthe nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise \\nby moving some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western \\ndiplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including \\ntanks, have been pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special \\nenvoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday that the situation in \\nKosovo has not improved. Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade for a meeting \\nwith Milosevic. ``While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have \\nabated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke \\nsaid after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and \\nSupreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. ``The situation therefore \\nremains fully as serious today as it was a week or two ago,'' he said. \\n``We hope to make clear to President Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia \\nthe extreme gravity of the situation.'' On Sunday, Milosevic met with \\nRussian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, \\nSerbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. \\nThe Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However, Ivanov \\nand Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive measures \\nare not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation,'' \\nForeign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news \\nagency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, \\nwithdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome \\nthe humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and \\ntake part in peace talks, he said. In Berlin, 7th graf pvs \\n\\nUnder NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian \\nseparatists in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia \\nhas ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may \\nwell avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats \\nsay. Milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by Washington as the \\nscourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace \\nin Bosnia, acted as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations \\nprepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention. \\nRussia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched \\nits foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission \\nto see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade. As he has so often, \\nMilosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demands in the nick of \\ntime and yet still accomplished what he wanted. This weekend, foreign \\ndiplomatic observers in Kosovo reported that a ``military stand-down'' \\nhad taken place in the province, where Milosevic's forces have waged \\na fierce offensive against Albanian rebels. The observers said that \\nexcept for segments of three brigades, most units of the Yugoslav \\narmy were ``home.'' The daily reports of the observer mission, made \\nup of U.S., European Union and Russian military experts, are one of \\nthe key elements in helping Washington and European capitals decide \\nwhether Milosevic has met their demands for a cease-fire. By putting \\nthe army back in its barracks, sending some police units out of Kosovo \\nand ordering an end to burning and looting of villages, Milosevic \\nmay well avoid a NATO attack, diplomats here and in Washington said. \\nBut at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked the \\nother way, he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the Kosovo \\nLiberation Army _ the rebel army fighting for independence for Kosovo \\nand its ethnic Albanian majority _ and terrorize the rural civilian \\npopulation that supports it. His military operation created more than \\n250,000 refugees, whom the Clinton administration is gearing up to \\ntake care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations. \\nU.S. officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy \\nwho dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia, \\nto meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo. \\nThe heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia, Yugoslavia's \\nprincipal republic, which insists on keeping Kosovo as a province, \\nand the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under Milosevic's repression \\nsince he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who \\nnow seek independence. The West, fearing the precedent that independence \\nfor Kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world, has been trying \\nto mediate a middle course. In essence, diplomats said they believed \\nthat the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic calls for a three-year \\ninterim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy \\narrangement. Since the Kosovo conflict flared up in March, critics \\nof Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue that he has been able \\nto choreograph every move to suit his goal: pushing the Albanian population \\ninto submission with impunity. ``The United States and its allies \\nhave waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation \\nArmy,'' said Morton Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group, \\na policy analysis organization, ``and taken three weeks to discuss \\nmilitary action, with the result that 500 Albanian villages were destroyed.'' \\nAdministration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed to \\nlive up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia, Milosevic \\ntook advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery \\nand tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose \\nbedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of \\nlarge swaths of Kosovo territory, including key roads. While he was \\ndoing that, Milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for Washington: \\nhe made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring Albania \\nand Macedonia, fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area. \\nAll along, the biggest fear in Washington has been that the Kosovo \\nconflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania \\nand the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause. \\nSuch a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict just \\nthree years after peace was secured in Bosnia. Milosevic catered to \\nWashington's concern that the conflict be contained. The Yugoslav \\narmy mined Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that \\nfew refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for \\nthe rebels. The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington was \\nunsure about how to deal with the disorganized Albanian political \\nleadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose \\nmain chiefs were hardened emigres returned from Switzerland and Germany. \\nFor example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to meet in May with Ibrahim \\nRugova, the top Albanian political leader in Kosovo, an encounter \\nthat turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity. For that \\nprocedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban \\non foreign investment in Serbia that had been put in place the month \\nbefore. After meeting with Rugova, Milosevic stepped up his military \\noperations in Kosovo, forcing Washington to reverse itself again and \\ncarry out the investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met with two \\nself-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province's western \\ntown of Junik but then broke off all contact. Clinton administration \\nofficials said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention \\nwould bolster the separatist forces. To try to put the best face on \\nthe situation, Washington worked with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept \\nthe presence of international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and \\nreport on military action. The monitors were slow in getting organized. \\nBy August, when the Yugoslav army, backed by the Serbian special police, \\nwere in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages \\nin the process, the monitors found it difficult to gain access to \\nthe fighting. They drove up to roadblocks, knew something was going \\non from the sounds and the smoke, but could not be precise. In recent \\ndays as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access has improved, \\nthe monitors say. But there are some areas in central Kosovo around \\nLikovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits \\nbecause of land mines on the roads. The mines are believed to have \\nbeen planted by the guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre \\nof 18 ethnic Albanian women, children and elderly people on Sept. \\n26. A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on \\nSunday said about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police \\nor the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon. \\nThe Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the \\nvast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict, said a report \\nby New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here on Sunday. \\nThe report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking \\ncivilian hostages and carrying out summary executions. But the violations \\nby the guerrillas were on a ``lesser scale'' than the government abuses, \\nthe author of the report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused \\non what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police \\nforces on three ethnic Albanian villages in late February and early \\nMarch in the Drenica region of central Kosovo. At least 83 people, \\nincluding 24 women and children, were killed in the attack, which \\ninvolved helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers. In \\nthe Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is a four-hour drive north through \\nrolling countryside from Kosovo's capital of Pristina, Milosevic remains \\npolitically secure. That is in part, his domestic critics say, because \\ndiplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N.refugee agency, Sadako \\nOgata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature. \\n\\nBRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said \\nMonday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks \\nago. Holbrooke said he will explain the ``extreme gravity of the situation'' \\nwhen he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday. \\nSpeaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana \\nand Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said \\n``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, \\nthe capacity for its resumption is there.'' ``The situation therefore \\nremains fully as serious today as it was a week or two ago,'' he told \\nreporters before flying to Belgrade. He plans to meet with the Kosovan \\nAlbanian leaders on Tuesday. ``We hope to make clear to president \\nMilosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the \\nsituation,'' he said. \\n\\nThe American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic \\nof Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomats told \\nhim that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in \\nKosovo Province or face a NATO attack. Milosevic was also told, the \\ndiplomats said, that he had to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic \\nAlbanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the \\nfighting in the last six months be allowed to return home. Most of \\nthese refugees are reluctant to return because many of the Serb police \\nofficers who destroyed their homes and villages remain in the neighborhoods. \\nAfter delivering his sternest message so far to Milosevic over the \\nKosovo conflict, Holbrooke said at a news conference that NATO's military \\nplans for attacking Serbia were moving ahead on a ``serious, intense \\nand sustained basis.'' Holbrooke's mission to Milosevic was described \\nby the American diplomats as ``not a do or die trip,'' but they added, \\n``We're at a very serious juncture.'' Shortly after Holbrooke's meeting \\nwith Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader issued a defiant statement on \\nSerbian television in which he said the ``threats of aggression'' \\noutlined by Holbrooke represented ``a criminal act.'' Milosevic, who \\nrarely comments about his meetings with foreign diplomats and whose \\ntough words cast an unusually ominous tone, also said that Holbrooke's \\nposition constituted ``support for Albanian terrorists and not the \\nAlbanian people.'' Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of \\nsupporting the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation \\nArmy, who have been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo \\nan independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added that ``for more than \\nseven days there have been no skirmishes or military action.'' An \\nAmerican diplomat familiar with the themes Holbrooke planned to stress \\nto Milosevic said there had been no expectation that the American \\nenvoy would walk out Monday night with an agreement. Rather, the point \\nwas to underscore to the Yugoslav leader and make explicit what was \\nexpected of him. ``It was not quite an ultimatum,'' the diplomat said, \\n``but more a matter of what steps have to be taken to show compliance.'' \\nThe essence of Holbrooke's demands centered on issues outlined in \\na United Nations Security Council resolution of two weeks ago. The \\nresolution ordered Milosevic to withdraw the extra army and police \\nforces that were sent to Kosovo to deal with the guerrillas and to \\nsend back to their bases the military forces normally stationed in \\nthe province. So far, American diplomats said, Milosevic has withdrawn \\ntroops from the field but not all of them are in their barracks. Such \\na move is essential, American diplomats said, to create a conducive \\natmosphere for any possible negotiations on the future status of the \\nprovince. The U.N. resolution also calls for a political solution. \\nHolbrooke and the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, \\ndiscussed with Milosevic a political document drawn up by the State \\nDepartment that calls for broad autonomy for Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew \\nthe autonomy in 1989 as he began his campaign of Serb nationalism. \\nThe countryside in central Kosovo has been eerily silent since last \\nThursday. The sound of artillery thuds and mortar rounds have been \\nnoticeably absent and the coils of white smoke that signified burning \\nvillages have vanished from the green hills and valleys. Police checkpoints \\nare more relaxed and areas that were sealed off this time last week \\nby the Yugoslav army are now open to the patrols of diplomatic monitors \\nfrom the United States, European Union and Russia. These monitors, \\nmany of whom are former military officers, have reported that the \\nYugoslav army has ``stood down'' and that they have seen virtually \\nno military action since late last week. There has been sporadic shooting, \\nthe monitors have reported. But this superficial calm is not good \\nenough because the Serb military has the capacity to resume fighting \\nvery quickly, a NATO military officer said Monday. The officer added \\nthat a cease-fire in Kosovo is ``pretty much enacted.'' He also said \\nthat the ``trend toward compliance is positive.'' The interior ministry \\npolice must also reduce their presence around villages so that refugees \\nwho have fled have the confidence to return, the military officer \\nsaid. Some interior ministry police officers had left the province, \\nbut not enough, he added. On the question of how badly damaged the \\nKLA had been by the Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, the NATO \\nofficer said, ``It's a fair assessment that the KLA is dismantled \\nbut not destroyed.'' Holbrooke's first stop Monday was Brussels, where \\nhe met with the secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday \\nhe plans to travel to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, where he is \\nscheduled to meet with the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to \\npresent the political proposal for the future status of Kosovo. He \\nis expected back in Belgrade on Tuesday afternoon for another session \\nwith Milosevic. \\n\\nThe United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav \\nPresident Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable \\nunless he takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province. \\nFearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense \\non high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving some tanks \\nand other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up \\nto 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been \\npulled out. However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday that \\nthe Kosovo situation remains critical despite a lull in fighting and \\nthe removal of some Yugoslav tanks and troops. Holbrooke spoke in \\nBrussels, Belgium, en route to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic. ``We \\nhope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia \\nthe extreme gravity of the situation,'' Holbrooke said after a meeting \\nwith NATO leaders. Holbrooke said he was told that NATO preparations \\ncontinued unabated. ``At NATO, the planning for military action is \\nserious, intense and sustained,'' he said. Serbian police and the \\nYugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the \\ncrackdown that began in late February. The conflict has killed hundreds \\n_ most of them Albanian civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees. \\nKosovo is in southern Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic \\nmet Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister \\nIgor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's \\ntop defense officials. The Russians are against using NATO force in \\nKosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur \\n``if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement \\nof the situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin \\ntold the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia \\nmust end the hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take \\nurgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees \\ncan return home and take part in peace talks, he said. In Berlin, \\nGerman Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that NATO action could \\ncome ``within days.'' NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. \\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to present Monday to the \\nSecurity Council on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands. Serb \\nauthorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an interim \\ngovernment in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic \\nin Yugoslavia. On Monday, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic \\nsaid the government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization \\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis. \\nYugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission until its membership \\nin the 54-nation organization is restored. Bulatovic also claimed \\nthere was no longer any fighting in the secessionist, majority Albanian \\nprovince. He said five of the 10 special police units had been removed \\nfrom Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in the province. \\nA Yugoslav statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo dispute \\nsolved peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall defend \\nour country with all means.'' One option could be for parliament to \\ndeclare a state of emergency _ a step which could lead to a general \\nmobilization of all military-aged men. The head of Yugoslavia's other \\nrepublic, Montenegro, on Monday urged Milosevic to accept all international \\ndemands and avert a NATO attack. ``We have to avert a clash with the \\nwhole world, a confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's \\npro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement. \\n\\nWith the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister \\nwarned Monday the nation faces the ``immiment danger of war'' and \\nclaimed the government was taking steps to comply with international \\ndemands for peace in Kosovo. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi \\nAnnan said ``systematic terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians \\nwithin recent days and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible. \\nBut Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide an \\nindependent assessment of compliance as required by the Security Council'' \\nand suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own judgement \\nin this respect.'' But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the \\nsituation in the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks \\nago. Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where \\nhe planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic \\n``the extreme gravity of the situation.'' Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's \\nprime minister told an emergency session of parliament Monday that \\nthe country ``is faced with the imminent danger of war.'' Kosovo is \\na province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. ``The threats \\nare serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. ``And I call on \\nthis parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent \\ndanger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend itself if it was attacked.'' \\nOne option could be for parliament to declare a state of emergency \\n_ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of all military-aged \\nmen. In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the government \\nhad accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for Security \\nand Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis. Yugoslavia had \\nrepeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership \\nin the 54-nation organization is restored. Bulatovic also claimed \\nthere was no longer any fighting in the rebellious, majority Albanian \\nprovince. He said five of the 10 special police units had been removed \\nfrom Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in the province. \\nIn Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would \\nnot be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO attack. ``While \\nthe level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the capacity for \\nits resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO \\nSecretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe \\nWesley K. Clark. ``The situation, therefore, remains fully as serious \\ntoday as it was a week or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear \\nto president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity \\nof the situation.'' Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, \\nMontenegro, called on Milosevic to accept all international demands \\nand avert a NATO attack. ``We have to avert a clash with the whole \\nworld, a confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's \\npro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement. Djukanovic, \\na staunch Milosevic critic, called on the Yugoslav president to address \\nthe nation ``with an unambiguous message'' that he has accepted all \\nU.N. resolutions and agreements he made with Russian President Boris \\nYeltsin. Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problems on Milosevic's ``undemocratic \\nregime.'' Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air \\ndefense on high alert and moved some tanks and other heavy equipment \\nout of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored \\nvehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out. Belgrade had been \\ncounting on Russia to block any U.N.-sanctioned military moves by \\nthe Western Alliance. On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign \\nMinister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President \\nMilan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. Although \\nthe Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo, Ivanov and Sergeyev \\nsaid the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive measures are not immediately \\ntaken for a radical improvement of the situation,'' Foreign Ministry \\nspokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid \\nsuch an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army \\nand security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian \\ncrisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace \\ntalks, he said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German \\nradio that NATO action could come ``within days.'' Serb authorities \\nappeared ready for compromise by installing an interim government \\nin the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. \\nSerbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo \\nAlbanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late February. The \\nconflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and \\nleft more than 275,000 refugees. Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent \\nof the province's 2 million-strong population, and most favor independence \\nor substantial self-rule. Momentum for outside involvement has increased \\nin the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian \\ncivilians in the forests of Kosovo. Although the United States and \\nEuropeans want an end to the fighting, they also oppose independence \\nfor Kosovo, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan countries \\nwith Albanian populations. In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA \\noffered to help NATO forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi \\nsaid in a statement published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper \\nBujku that ``we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality'' and \\n``we shall provide assistance... if it is asked of us.'' Krasniqi \\naccused ethnic Albanian politicians of having ``given up on independence'' \\nand having become ``the servants of the enemy,'' by agreeing to accept \\nautonomy but not independence. Ethnic Albanian political leaders have \\nrejected the new interim government, which was drawn up without their \\nparticipation. The council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic \\nAlbanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. \\n\\nWith the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister \\nwarned Monday the nation faces the ``imminent danger of war'' and \\nclaimed the government is taking steps to comply with international \\ndemands for peace in Kosovo. But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana \\ntold reporters that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met \\nthe conditions demanded by the U.N. Security Council. ``The reality \\ncoming to us is that the compliance is not yet in place,'' Solana \\nsaid. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I can tell you we \\nare ready.'' In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic \\nterror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days \\nand that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible. But Annan said he \\ndid not ``have the means necessary to provide an independent assessment \\nof compliance as required by the Security Council'' and suggested \\nthe 15 members may want to make their ``own judgement in this respect.'' \\nFollowing a meeting with Solana in Brussels, Belgium, U.S. special \\nenvoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern Serbian \\nprovince was as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke said he would \\ntell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of ``the extreme gravity \\nof the situation.'' Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said \\nHolbrooke arrived in Belgrade late Monday afternoon and was expected \\nto meet Milosevic in the evening. \\n\\nWith NATO attacks said to be only days away, top U.S. envoy Richard \\nHolbrooke delivered an 11th-hour warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president \\nto halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes. \\nBut there was no sign that Slobodan Milosevic was backing down. Following \\nhis meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement \\ndenouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' which favored separatist \\nethnic Albanian guerrillas. The statement, broadcast by government \\ntelevision, said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province \\nfor the past seven days and that the crisis represented no threat \\nto other countries in the southern Balkans. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador-designate \\nto the United Nations, met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday \\nafter arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior \\nNATO officials. There was no statement from Holbrooke after the meeting. \\nBefore boarding a plane for Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said conditions \\nin the southern Serbian province had not improved since the alliance \\nstarted two weeks ago to finalize plans for air raids to force Milosevic \\nto halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists. Holbrooke \\nsaid he planned to drive home to Milosevic ``the extreme gravity of \\nthe situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the peace deal with Milosevic \\nand other Balkan leaders that ended the 3 and one-half year Bosnian \\nwar in 1995. In Washington, President Clinton expressed concern that \\nMilosevic was ``playing the classic game of making false promises'' \\nto avoid NATO military strikes. Clinton, in a telephone call with \\nRussian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with \\nU.N. demands ``must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible,'' press \\nsecretary Joe Lockhart said at the White House. ``What happens next \\ndepends on President Milosevic,'' Lockhart quoted the president telling \\nthe Russian leader, who has opposed the use of force against Moscow's \\nlongtime ally. As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiations, \\nBritish Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO military \\naction was imminent. ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later \\nthis week we will expect a decision to be taken,'' Cook told reporters \\nafter a special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony \\nBlair. In Brussels, NATO officials said they were ready to launch \\nairstrikes within hours of receiving an order to attack. If that first \\nairstrike failed to deter Serb forces, a senior NATO official said \\non condition of anonymity, the alliance could unleash a ``fully fledged \\nair campaign'' involving hundreds of planes. At the United Nations, \\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav forces had increased their \\nattacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even after a U.N. resolution \\ndemanded a cease-fire. In a widely anticipated report to the Security \\nCouncil, Annan listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution, \\ndecried the ``appalling atrocities in Kosovo,'' and said it was ``clear \\nbeyond any reasonable doubt'' that Yugoslav forces were responsible \\nfor the bulk of them. The U.N. chief also said rebel forces of the \\nKosovo Liberation Army also were responsible for human rights violations, \\na charge the KLA quickly denied. NATO countries had been awaiting \\nthe U.N. chief's report to determine whether to use military force \\nto stop the offensive on ethnic Albanians, who are seeking autonomy \\nlike they had until 1989, if not independence, from Yugoslavia. Albanians \\nin the province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness \\nto declare Serb noncompliance, State Department spokesman James Foley \\nsaid the Clinton administration believed Milosevic had not met the \\nconditions laid down by the Security Council. Briefing reporters in \\nWashington, Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire, the failure \\nto arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic Albanian leaders and \\nthe continued presence of ``major army units'' in southeastern Kosovo \\nnear Albania's border. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told \\nan emergency session of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced \\nwith the imminent danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant \\nSerbia and smaller Montenegro. ``The threats are serious,'' Prime \\nMinister Momir Bulatovic said. ``And I call on this parliament to \\nconclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war. \\nYugoslavia has to defend itself if it was attacked.'' One option was \\nfor parliament to declare a state of emergency _ a step toward a mobilization \\nof all military-aged men. But the parliament voted to introduce the \\nmeasure ``when the first bomb drops on our territory.'' In an attempt \\nto head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the government had accepted \\na Russian proposal for an investigation by the 54-nation Organization \\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yugoslavia had repeatedly \\nrejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the \\norganization is restored. The prime minister also said there was no \\nlonger any fighting in Kosovo, which has 2 million residents. He said \\nfive of the 10 special police units had been removed from Kosovo and \\nthe others had been returned to their barracks in the province. One \\ndiplomat in Kosovo, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there \\nhas been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops out of \\nKosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade that \\npulled out Sunday. Some army units remain in the field, and there \\nis enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly among refugees, \\ntens of thousands of whom are living in the hills and forests without \\nshelter. \\n\\nThe United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President \\nSlobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless \\nhe takes decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the \\nsouthern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put \\nthe nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise \\nby moving some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western \\ndiplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including \\ntanks, have been pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special \\nenvoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday that the situation in \\nKosovo is as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade \\nfor a meeting with Milosevic. ``While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) \\nmay have abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there,'' \\nHolbrooke said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier \\nSolana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. ``The \\nsituation therefore remains fully as serious today as it was a week \\nor two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic \\nand the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation.'' \\nOn Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov \\nand Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic \\nand Yugoslavia's top defense officials. The Russians are against using \\nNATO force in Kosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes \\ncould occur ``if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a \\nradical improvement of the situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman \\nVladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an \\nattack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security \\nforces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, \\nensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks, \\nhe said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio \\nthat NATO action could come ``within days.'' NATO's decision may depend \\non a report U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to present \\nto the Security Council Monday on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. \\ndemands. Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing \\nan interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant \\nrepublic in Yugoslavia. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have \\nrouted separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began \\nin late February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them \\nAlbanian civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees. A Yugoslav \\nstatement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo dispute solved \\npeacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall defend our country \\nwith all means.'' The government said Friday that the fighting had \\nended and blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels, who \\nare fighting for independence for the Serbian province. Although the \\nUnited States and Europeans want an end to the fighting, they also \\noppose independence for the majority Albanian province, fearing that \\ncould destabilize other Balkan countries with Albanian populations. \\nIn the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offered to help NATO forces \\nif asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement published \\nMonday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that ``we wish they \\n(airstrikes) would become reality'' and ``we shall provide assistance... \\nif it is asked of us.'' Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians \\nof having ``given up on independence'' and having become ``the servants \\nof the enemy,'' by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence. \\nSerbs reported two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by Albanian ``terrorists'' \\n25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital. \\nElsewhere, a policeman was killed after stepping on a mine, the Serb \\nMedia Center said. The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the \\nethnic Albanians, reported heavy fighting between government forces \\nand the guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. \\nEthnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim government, \\nwhich was drawn up without their participation. The council is composed \\nof seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. \\nMomentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week amid \\nrevelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the forests \\nof Kosovo. London's Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain is preparing \\ntroops and armored units for Kosovo, to be deployed in a post-airstrike \\npeacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused to confirm or deny \\nthe report but repeated that Britain was ready to participate in a \\nNATO attack. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night \\nwith his British counterpart, Robin Cook, to discuss the situation \\nin Kosovo, France's Foreign Ministry said. Vedrine and Secretary of \\nState Madeleine Albright had a lengthy telephone conversation as well, \\nthe spokesman said. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said both Milosevic's \\ngovernment and ethnic Albanian rebels have committed atrocities since \\nthe conflict began, but the government abuses were on a much greater \\nscale. The report by the New York-based human rights organization \\nsays Milosevic has ``the primary responsibility for gross government \\nabuses.'' \\n\\nWith NATO attacks said to be only days away, top U.S. envoy Richard \\nHolbrooke delivered a last-minute warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president \\nto halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes. \\nBut Slobodan Milosevic showed no signs of backing down. Following \\nhis meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement \\ndenouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' that favored separatist \\nethnic Albanian guerrillas. The statement, broadcast by government \\ntelevision, said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province \\nfor the past seven days and that the crisis represented no threat \\nto other countries in the southern Balkans. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador-designate \\nto the United Nations, met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday \\nafter arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior \\nNATO officials. Holbrooke issued no statement after the meeting. Before \\nboarding a plane for the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke \\nsaid conditions in the southern Serbian province had not improved \\nsince the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air \\nraids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian \\nseparatists. Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic \\n``the extreme gravity of the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the \\npeace deal with Milosevic and other Balkan leaders that ended the \\n3 1/2 year Bosnian war in 1995. In Washington, U.S. President Bill \\nClinton expressed concern that Milosevic was ``playing the classic \\ngame of making false promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes. Clinton, \\nin a telephone call with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's \\ncompliance with U.N. demands ``must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible,'' \\npress secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White House. ``What happens \\nnext depends on President Milosevic,'' Lockhart quoted the president \\ntelling the Russian leader, who has opposed the use of force against \\nMoscow's longtime ally. As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through \\nnegotiations, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision \\non NATO military action was imminent. ``We are getting ready for NATO \\naction and later this week we will expect a decision to be taken,'' \\nCook told reporters after a special session of the Cabinet called \\nby Prime Minister Tony Blair. In Brussels, NATO officials said they \\nwere ready to launch airstrikes within hours of receiving an order \\nto attack. If that first airstrike failed to deter Serb forces, a \\nsenior NATO official said on condition of anonymity, the alliance \\ncould unleash a ``fully fledged air campaign'' involving hundreds \\nof planes. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said \\nYugoslav forces had increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians \\neven after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire. In a widely anticipated \\nreport to the Security Council, Annan listed apparent violations of \\na Sept. 23 U.N. resolution, decried the ``appalling atrocities in \\nKosovo,'' and said it was ``clear beyond any reasonable doubt'' that \\nYugoslav forces were responsible for the bulk of them.

Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire, \\nthe failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic Albanian \\nleaders and the continued presence of ``major army units'' in southeastern \\nKosovo near Albania's border. The European Union nations were divided \\nMonday on whether to launch air strikes without U.N. Security Council \\nbacking. The EU foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, agreed to \\ntighten economic sanctions against Milosevic, but it was unlikely \\nthat stricter travel curbs for Yugoslav officials and freezing more \\nYugoslav assets abroad would be anything more than symbolic. Meanwhile, \\nYugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session of parliament \\nMonday that the country ``is faced with the imminent danger of war.'' \\nYugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro. \\n``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. \\n``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced \\nwith the imminent danger of war.

One diplomat in Kosovo, who spoke on condition \\nof anonymity, said there has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav \\narmy troops out of Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized \\nbrigade that pulled out Sunday. Some army units remain in the field, \\nand there is enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly \\namong refugees, tens of thousands of whom are living in the hills \\nand forests without shelter. \\n\", \"\\nMaking their first collective decision about monetary policy, the \\n11 European nations launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest \\nrates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence. Ten \\nof the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped their \\nkey interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most significant \\nplunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 \\npercent. The exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. \\nIt is expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is \\nlaunched. Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying \\nthe groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected \\nrates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent before \\nthe cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate levels had become a \\ncontentious political issue with center-left governments in Germany \\nand France pushing for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment, \\nstuck at 10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro. The head of \\nthe European Central Bank that will set monetary policy for the euro \\nnations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday suggested governments should \\nreform rigid labor markets to create jobs, and not pressure him to \\ncut rates. The remarks in Brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave \\nno hint that a rate drop was imminent, but made clear his resistance \\nto political pressure was as strong as ever. So strong, in fact, that \\nDutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he had feared the bank would \\ndelay the decision. ``What had been feared was that, in order to prove \\nits independence, the ECB would go against its own analysis and would \\nwait longer, which would have been nonsensical,'' Zalm said. Hans \\nTietmeyer, who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB is modeled, \\nhinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in the new currency, \\ndampened by global economic crises and Europe's worsening outlook. \\n``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current \\npessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,'' Tietmeyer \\nsaid. The cuts seemed to have the desired impact. Frankfurt's main \\nindex closed up 2.1 percent, while France's was up 1.8 percent. The \\ncuts also boosted markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even Britain, \\nwhich is not among the nations launching the euro. ``The reaction \\nis, `Oh good, they're doing a little bit to prop up the euro economy.' \\nBut confidence has taken quite a hit across Europe recently, and I \\nthink further action from the ECB will be needed next year, maybe \\ndown to 2.5 percent,'' James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist \\nwith Nomura. An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth \\nVan de Craen, said the cuts were timely. ``We are clearly headed for \\na slowdown,'' she said. Until recently, Europe's economies had held \\nout relatively well against damage from Asia and Russia's economic \\ncrises and unstable financial markets. But just two days ago, Duisenberg \\npainted the bleakest picture yet of Europe's economies, warning growth \\nwill likely slow to 2.5 percent next year from earlier expectations \\nof 3 percent. The rate cuts may help. By making it cheaper to borrow \\nmoney, rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses, making \\nit less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend. That expands \\nthe economy. The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium, \\nIreland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, \\nSpain and Portugal. \\n\\nStruggling to avoid being sidelined in the Continent-wide equities \\nmarket promised by Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, \\nFrench authorities said Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would \\njoin an alliance between London and Frankfurt that is seen as the \\nprecursor of a pan-European market. The Bourse in Paris also announced \\nthat it would play host to a meeting Nov. 27 of nine other European \\nexchanges to discuss ``the steps and conditions needed to create a \\nunifying and competitive pan-European equity market.'' The two announcements \\nshow how the introduction of the currency, the euro, is reshaping \\nEurope's financial landscape, requiring Europeans to think in Continental \\nrather than national terms in finance and business. And it suggested \\nthat exchange authorities in Paris, ruffled by the announcement in \\nJuly of a ``strategic alliance'' between the London Stock Exchange \\nand the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt, had not only abandoned an effort \\nto set up a rival market but were also seeking to gain the initiative \\nby organizing the Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, \\nabout the timing and technicalities of the French entry into the alliance. \\nForeign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, ``Paris is joining this \\nalliance with the creation from January 1999 of a joint company.'' \\nHowever, officials in London and Frankfurt _ who welcomed the idea \\nin principle _ declined to say whether the timing and the arrangements \\nwere as far advanced as Strauss-Kahn implied. ``I'm afraid I can't \\nconfirm anything like that,'' a spokeswoman at the London Stock Exchange \\nsaid. ``The appearances are well ahead of the reality at this point,'' \\nsaid an American banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \\nNot only that, the notion of a Europe-wide exchange raises technical \\nquestions about the compatibility not just of trading systems but \\nalso of the regulations governing stock market operations in the countries \\nthat will use the euro beginning in January. That has led some analysts \\nto forecast that a pan-European exchange could not be up and running \\nbefore 2000. ``There are an awful lot of issues to be resolved,'' \\nthe American banker said. The euro is to be introduced for electronic \\ntrading of equities, bonds and futures and for intergovernmental transfers. \\nNotes and coins _ the pocket money that shoppers and travelers will \\ncarry _ will be introduced only in 2002. Initially, the currency will \\ngroup 11 European nations in a euro zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, \\nSweden and Greece on the outside. With its concentration of banking \\nand trading, however, London is expected to continue as the main market \\ncenter. The prospect has heightened pressure for consolidation among \\nexchanges. Stock market officials in Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and \\nBrussels have indicated they would be interested in joining the London-Frankfurt \\nalliance, which will initially create a single point of liquidity \\nfor trading in British and German blue-chip issues. The London exchange \\nestimates that a pan-European stock exchange would group together \\ncompanies with a market capitalization of $5.5 trillion, compared \\nwith $8.7 trillion on the New York Stock Exchange. The Paris Bourse, \\nthe third largest of the European exchanges and the last major holdout \\ntoward a pan-European market, said that it had also invited officials \\nfrom exchanges in Zurich and Stockholm to attend the Nov. 27 meeting. \\nA spokeswoman said officials from the London Stock Exchange would \\nbe at the meeting. Also Thursday, the New York Mercantile Exchange \\nand the International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledged that they \\nwere considering a merger that would bring together the two biggest \\nenergy futures markets. Discussions began in July, and the exchanges \\nhave formed a working group to study a merger. They already cooperate \\nin the development of a system intended to coordinate after-hours \\nelectronic trading. \\n\\nIn his most candid remarks yet on the economy, European Central Bank \\nPresident Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing \\nin the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency _ or euro _ on \\nJan. 1. Despite an area-wide survey that suggested ``a moderation \\nin the pace of growth,'' Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue \\nto boost the economy. He pointed also to a gradual improvement in \\nlabor market conditions as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate \\ncuts toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate countries. \\nDuisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec. \\n22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the \\noutlook for inflation and the EU economy. The bank, which will set \\nmonetary policy for the currency bloc, has been under pressure from \\npoliticians to keep interest rates low to help boost growth and create \\njobs. While inflation is at its lowest levels in decades _ just 1 \\npercent in the euro-zone _ unemployment in the 11 nations remains \\nstubbornly high at 10.9 percent. \\n\\nPalm Pilot in one hand, cellular phone in the other, Jean-Marc Routiers, \\n26, was juggling business calls halfway between London and Paris. \\nWhen his phone went dead as the high-speed Eurostar train pulled into \\nthe underwater tunnel that links England to the Continent, the London-based \\nFrench banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself. \\n``I definitely describe myself as a European,'' he said in the fluent \\nEnglish he perfected working at an Australian bank. ``I may get sentimental \\nwhen they play the Marseillaise, but for all the practical things, \\nI see myself as a citizen of Europe. I like the lifestyle in France, \\nbut I don't make my living there.'' The year 1999 is the official \\nstart-up date of the euro, the common European currency that will \\nunite 11 countries monetarily. But throughout Europe, a different \\nkind of integration has already taken root. Routiers, who was spending \\na day in Paris to meet with his bank's French clients, is at the vanguard \\nof a new generation of Europeans who do not have to brace themselves \\nfor a shock in the new year. Mobile, fluent in several languages and \\naggressively non-nationalistic, they are already living the kind of \\nborderless, cosmopolitan existence that the single European currency \\nis supposed to advance. They do not share their parents' memories \\nof World War II or their parents' sense of national identity. ``People \\nworry when they hear talk of a common European defense policy because \\nit suggests that at the end of the day, we have one government,'' \\nsaid Kleon Papadopoulos, a Greek banker based in London. ``Countries \\nare afraid to lose their sovereignty, but I don't see it as a bad \\nthing. If a government is good, stable and efficient, who cares if \\nit is based in Berlin or Athens?'' Papadopoulos, 36, who studied business \\nin the United States and Britain, could serve as a model for the new \\nEuropeans. He works for a Swiss bank in London, speaks Greek, English \\nand French, and in the past year has traveled, among other places, \\nto Belgium, the United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. Like hundreds \\nof thousands of other Europeans, he chose London _ and its busy financial \\nmarkets _ as the best place to work. He said he does not feel as if \\nhe lives in England. He lives in London, the clubhouse of financial \\nEurope. And membership has its privileges. Papadopoulos lives in the \\nfashionable Knightsbridge area, drives a Porsche he bought in Brussels, \\nand works out at the fashionable gym of the Carleton Towers. ``I went \\nto the London School of Economics in 1984, and the only other `foreigners' \\nI met were from the Middle East,'' he says. ``Now friends and co-workers \\nare Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, even Russian. You feel \\nit everywhere. The streets are jammed with foreigners. Not tourists \\n_ people who live and work here.'' Baby-boomers in Europe often describe \\nthemselves as the 1968 generation, weaned on the protest and social \\nturmoil that convulsed European societies 30 years ago. Less dramatic \\nbut equally significant was a 1968 law guaranteeing freedom of movement \\nwithin what were then the six countries of the Common Market. A Frenchman \\ncould work in Holland, an Italian could work in Germany without a \\npermit. Back then some economists dourly predicted huge migrations, \\nparticularly of unskilled laborers moving from southern countries \\nto the more prosperous north. Actually, as huge industries like steel \\nshrank in the 1970s and '80s, so did the job opportunities for working-class \\nEuropeans. There are 15 countries within what is now the European \\nUnion, but only a small percentage of their citizens have moved to \\nother countries, according to estimates prepared by Eurostat. Those \\nwho do mostly find jobs in the service industry as waiters, maids \\nor garbage collectors. There are still legal barriers preventing most \\ndoctors, lawyers and academics from finding work in other countries. \\nSo far the European Union has been most profitably put to use by white-collar \\nbusiness executives who eagerly followed career opportunities across \\nnational borders, time zones and language barriers. Twenty-five years \\nago that kind of mobility was the preserve of a far smaller elite, \\nthe top executives of major companies or multinational corporations. \\nTechnology, from high-speed trains to the ever-evolving apparatus \\nof business _ lap-top computers, cell phones, fax machines _ has made \\nEuropean mobility accessible to mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs \\nand even students. Cable television, which allows Germans to watch \\nItalian game shows or Swedes to watch French news programs, has spread \\nthe Zeitgeist to the masses. This year Superga, an Italian brand of \\nsports clothes and shoes, opened a major advertising campaign with \\na series of magazine ads that show fashionable young people saucily \\ncavorting with European leaders _ a leggy young woman pushes her bicycle \\nup the steps of the Elysee Palace to greet President Jacques Chirac, \\na young man playfully sticks his tongue out the window of the plane \\nof the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. ``This kind of ad would \\nnot have been possible five or 10 years ago,'' said Aldo Cernuto, \\nexecutive creative director of the Milan office of Pirella Gottsche \\nLowe, an international advertising agency. ``Now European unification \\nis on the TV all the time; it has seeped into people's unconscious. \\nEven people who do not care about politics recognize the faces of \\na Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. Ten years ago, very few people did.'' \\nAccording to the European Union, Britain has twice as many EU citizens \\nas France, but it is not the country with the highest concentration \\nof residents from other European countries. According to estimates \\nbased on surveys prepared by Eurostat, nearly a third of the residents \\nof tiny Luxembourg, which has low unemployment and a high standard \\nof living, are from other European countries. Belgium, which has the \\nEuropean Commission and NATO headquarters, is second, with 5.4 percent. \\nParadoxically, perhaps, Britain, the one major European nation that \\nhas held off from joining the euro, is widely viewed as the nerve \\ncenter of the new cosmopolitanism, headquarters for the New Europeans \\n_ bankers and business executives drawn by London's financial district, \\na more flexible bureaucracy and the universality of the English language. \\nPerhaps just as surprisingly, London also serves as an example of \\nanother less obvious aspect of European cosmopolitanism _ the breakdown \\nof certain social barriers. Studying abroad was once a privilege reserved \\nto the sons and daughters of Europe's elite. Now the European Union \\nhas a 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that \\nthis year allowed 200,000 European university students _ 5 percent \\nof the EU's entire university population _ to study in other countries \\nwithin the Union for up to a year, free. In the last 20 years, business \\nschools in Europe have multiplied, and most offer U.S.-style MBA programs \\nthat teach an American approach to business. This too has allowed \\na measure of meritocracy to creep into European business. ``Juergen \\nSchrempp, the head of Daimler, started as a car mechanic,'' noted \\nStephen Szabo, a professor of European Affairs at the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School for International Studies in Washington. ``That \\nwould have been unthinkable in Germany 20 years ago.'' Social mobility, \\nmoreover, is fueled by movement. When people transfer to another country, \\nthey find it easier to shed the psychological or cultural trappings \\nof home. ``I could never have the kind of job I have had I stayed \\nin Paris,'' Routier explained. ``France is still very hierarchical. \\nBosses want to know where you went to school, what your father does. \\nIn London, none of that matters as long as you make money.'' Many \\nBritons still view their country as weighed down by heavy class distinctions. \\nFor example, Tony Smith, 36, editor of several Portuguese magazines \\nin Lisbon, seized an opportunity to study in Vienna 14 years ago, \\nand never looked back. He has lived all over Europe, and is fluent \\nin Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. His father, \\na car mechanic, had not traveled out of Britain until 1992. Smith \\nsaid he could never have succeeded as well had he stayed home. ``I \\ndidn't go to public schools or Oxbridge,'' he explained. ``I'm not \\nsaying its impossible, but it would have been much more difficult \\nin England.'' Yet Continental Europeans who flock to London find themselves \\nbypassing English society and joining a cosmopolitan world where birth \\nand breeding do not matter as much. Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose to work \\nin London to escape the sexism she encountered on the Continent. Mrs. \\nIliffe, who is Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and \\nItalian, and met her Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while both \\nwere attending the University of Bocconi business school in Milan \\nin 1995. Like his wife, Iliffe speaks four languages and has lived \\nand traveled all over the world. She works on the Eastern European \\ndesk of a British bank; he works for a major international consulting \\nfirm. Originally they planned to work in Italy, but Mrs. Iliffe said \\nthe prevailing attitude towards working women there made it impossible \\nfor her to find as good a job. ``I went to job interviews at Italian \\nbanks and they only asked me about my husband's job,'' she said with \\na grimace. ``And they made it clear that they were afraid I would \\nget pregnant and ask for maternity leave.'' Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, \\na professor at Insead, the prestigious international business school \\nin Fontainebleau, outside Paris, called Mrs. Iliffe's choices cherry-picking \\n_ choosing the best deal for herself. As he put it, ``If they cannot \\nfind what they want in one country, they can pick up and seek it elsewhere.'' \\nTwenty-five years ago, Haspeslagh was a pioneer when he did the same \\nthing. A Belgian who studied business at Harvard, he lives and teaches \\nin France and does consulting work all over Europe, from Sweden to \\nthe Czech Republic. The message on his cell phone is in three languages \\n_ French, Flemish and English. His students, a generation behind him, \\nsee nothing exceptional in his transnationalism. These Europeans form \\nan advance guard that is still relatively small in numbers, but experts \\nsay they carry a disproportionate influence on their societies. ``In \\nGermany, for example, it is the business people who are pushing ahead \\nwith change and pulling politicians along behind them kicking and \\nscreaming,'' Szabo said. ``They are looking at a larger market and \\nfeel the competitive pressures of globalization.

They are answering to an international \\none.'' \\n\\nChina made trading in the euro official Monday, announcing authorization \\nfor the European common currency's use in trade and financial dealings \\nstarting Jan. 1. The expected announcement from the central People's \\nBank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, carried \\nby the official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized the opening of \\neuro accounts. ``Financial institutions, enterprises and individuals \\nin China can accept and use the euro in economic, trade and financial \\nexchanges with 11 members of the European Union effective January \\n1, 1999,'' Xinhua reported. ``In addition, they can convert, use and \\nopen the euro accounts,'' it said. Chinese officials have said the \\ngovernment may convert a proportion of its dlrs 145 billion worth \\nof foreign exchange reserves into the euro after the currency's Jan. \\n1 debut. The 11 countries launching the common currency are Austria, \\nBelgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the \\nNetherlands, Spain and Portugal. \\n\\nTwo days before the new euro currency goes into effect for 11 European \\nUnion members, a growing number of Danes believe their country should \\ntake part, according to a poll published Tuesday. The survey by the \\nMegaphone polling institute said 54 percent of the 1,009 people surveyed \\nfavor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that. The remaining \\n10 percent were undecided. The poll, conducted Dec. 18-22, was broadcast \\nby TV2 channel. Denmark is one of four EU countries staying out of \\nthe monetary union for the time being. After voters in 1992 rejected \\nthe Maastricht treaty that established the system, Denmark won opt-out \\nclauses. The treaty then was approved. Danish voters traditionally \\nhave been lukewarm supporters of the EU. Although many politicians \\nsupport the unified currency, they have been wary about bringing the \\nissue to voters again. A poll published last October showed 46 percent \\nof Danes favored the single currency, while 44 percent were opposed. \\nIt would take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt the \\nnew currency. The government has said it has no plans to hold a referendum \\nbefore the year 2001. \\n\\nThe annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as \\ntheir shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the \\nEuropean Union's statistics agency reported Wednesday. The fall continued \\nthe steady decline of inflation in the euro-zone over the past year. \\nAnnual inflation stood at 1 percent in October and 1.6 percent in \\nNovember 1997, according to Eurostat's monthly report. In the 15 nation \\nEU as a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent in November compared to \\n1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8 percent in Japan. Germany, \\nFrance, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, \\nFinland, Ireland and Luxembourg are set to adopt the euro as a common \\ncurrency at midnight on New Year's Eve. The latest figures may hint \\nat trouble ahead for the euro-zone with significant increases over \\nthe year in Portugal and Ireland. With the European Central Bank setting \\na common interest rate for the whole bloc, some economists fear the \\nlow rate designed to boost core EU economies like France and Germany \\nmay bring overheating in smaller nations with faster growth. There \\nwas good news for Greece which was kept out of the euro-zone for failing \\nto meet economic conditions for joining, including low inflation. \\nIt's rate was 3.9 percent in November down from 5 percent a year before. \\nGreece hops to join the euro-zone in 2001. Denmark, Sweden and Britain \\ndecided to stay out of the euro for political reasons. Eurostat gave \\nthe following rates for November 1998, with November 1997 in brackets: \\nSweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, \\n0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, \\n1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 \\n(1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, \\n2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5). \\n\\nWim Duisenberg, the head of the new European Central Bank, said in \\nan interview published Wednesday that he won't step down after completing \\nhalf his term as earlier agreed. ``I had hoped you wouldn't ask me \\nthat question. The answer is no,'' Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, \\nwhich had asked him if he would step down after four years on the \\njob. Duisenberg was named this spring as head of the new European \\nCentral Bank, which will govern the policies of the euro, the new \\nsingle currency which goes into effect Jan. 1. France surprised its \\neuro partners by proposing its central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, \\nat the last minute for the job Duisenberg was expected to secure easily. \\nAlthough he was elected easily, Duisenberg agreed to step down after \\nfour years of his eight year term although he has since said no such \\n``gentleman's agreement'' exists. Duisenberg told Le Monde, a newspaper \\nthat fervently has backed the euro, that the the introduction of the \\nnew currency is the most ``significant'' step so far toward European \\nunification. However, he said that he would like to see further political \\nintegration, especially in the area of foreign tax and social policies. \\n\\nIn a surprise move, nations adopting the new European currency, the \\neuro, dropped key interest rates Thursday, effectively setting the \\nrate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1. Ten \\nof the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rate \\nto 3 percent. Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The coordinated \\nmove was a key step in preparing for economic union. Setting a common \\ninterest rates had been a particularly contentious issue as center-left \\ngovernments in Germany and France pressed for lower rates to help \\nboost growth and cut unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the \\neuro zone. European Central Bank chief, Wim Duisenberg, gave no hint \\nof the rate cuts during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday, instead \\nsuggesting that governments should reform rigid labor markets to create \\njobs. In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central \\nbankers cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent. Rates \\nbefore the cuts had varied throughout the future currency zone, from \\n3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria. The European Central \\nBank said in a statement from its Frankfurt headquarters that the \\nmove was decided during a meeting Tuesday of its the policy-making \\ngoverning council. The governing council comprises the 11 heads of \\nnational central banks plus a six-member directorate, including the \\nbank president Duisenberg. ``The joint reduction in interest rates \\nhas to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates \\nwith which the (bank) will start ... monetary union,'' the statement \\nsaid, adding the 3-percent rate would be maintained ``for the foreseeable \\nfuture.'' In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the \\nmove reflected the worsening outlook for European economies, and wasn't \\na capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine. \\n``It's not a dramatic step. It wasn't in response to political pressure,'' \\nTietmeyer said, referring to Germany's cut. ``The coordinated rate \\ncut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction \\nin financial market turbulence,'' he said. But Tietmeyer, head of \\nthe bank on which the ECB is modeled, promised that the rate cut does \\nnot signal the start of a volatile monetary policy. ``It's not a shift \\nfrom the Bundesbank's steady-hand policy,'' he said. Growth in Europe \\nhas been hit by the Asian and Russian economic crises and turbulence \\non international financial markets. Duisenberg has said growth in \\nthe euro area countries next year will be about 2.5 percent, lower \\nthan the 3 percent predicted earlier. \\n\\nEurope's dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when 11 \\nnations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro \\nand create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond \\nthe Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean. The euro's birth \\nis being hailed as a historic turning point in international finance \\nand is arguably the greatest single step in the drive to create a \\nunited Europe from the ruins of World War II. ``This Dec. 31, 1998, \\nwill be one of the great dates in the history of the 20th century,'' \\nFrench Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. \\n``It's the beginning of a new era.'' On what Europeans are calling \\n``E-day,'' economic and finance ministers from the 11 nations will \\nhuddle at European Union headquarters to agree to the rates at which \\nGerman marks, Italian lire and the rest are absorbed into euro. Strauss-Kahn \\nsaid the euro would likely be worth 6.56 to 6.57 French francs. \\n\", \"\\nLebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified a constitutional amendment \\nto clear the way for the election of the army's commander, Gen. Emile \\nLahoud, as president. Lahoud has received the backing of Syria, the \\nmain power broker in the country, making the election by Lebanon's \\npro-Syrian Parliament later this week just a formality. A total of \\n113 deputies voted for the amendment and four deputies against, including \\nthe general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a presidential aspirant. Eleven \\ndeputies were absent. Among those who were absent was Walid Jumblatt, \\na Cabinet minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest \\nthe choice of a military man even though Lahoud has wide public and \\npolitical support. The 128-member legislature is expected to meet \\nThursday to elect Lahoud after outgoing President Elias Hrawi signs \\nthe constitutional amendment. The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution \\nrevokes a ban on senior civil servants from running for the presidency. \\nThe new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office. \\nHrawi has served for nine years, including a three-year extension \\nin 1995 to his six-year term. Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep \\nalive a 55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, \\nthe prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite \\nMuslim. Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion \\nin the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited \\nwith rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the \\nreign of militias. Many hope he will copy his success with the military \\nin the government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public \\nfunds. But some fear of military dominance of public life. \\n\\nPrime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business tycoon who launched Lebanon's \\nmultibillion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of civil war, \\nsaid Monday he was bowing out as premier following a dispute with \\nthe new president. He accused President Emile Lahoud of violating \\nthe constitution and demanded that he acknowledge it before he could \\nreconsider his position. Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more \\npower as a new government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated \\nby the possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect \\nLebanon's economic recovery. ``I'm not a candidate,'' Hariri said \\nin a live interview with CNN. He demanded that Lahoud admit that he \\nacted unconstitutionally by allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize \\nhim to name a prime minister instead of naming one themselves. Such \\nan action ``might put the country in danger,'' Hariri warned. Asked \\nif there was a risk of renewed conflict in Lebanon over the alleged \\ntampering with the constitution, Hariri said: ``If the president continues \\nwith this, I don't know what will happen.'' But the dispute between \\nthe two leaders appears to be over who will have the upper hand in \\ngoverning the nation of 3.2 million. Lahoud, 62, is an army commander \\nwho wants to assert his authority at the start of his six-year presidential \\nterm. Hariri, 53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country \\nsince he became premier six years ago under former President Elias \\nHrawi. A brief meeting on Monday between the two did not help resolve \\nthe disagreements. Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker \\ncapacity since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday. Lahoud on Monday \\nset the stage for choosing a new prime minister when he scheduled \\na fresh round of consultations with Parliament for Tuesday and Wednesday. \\nIn a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to form \\nthe next government after a previous round of consultations. The offer \\ncame after the 128 legislators polled by the president gave Hariri \\na majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing he had received \\nin his previous three mandates since 1992. Hariri is credited with \\nrestoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. \\nHis globe-trotting travels to drum up political and economic support \\nwere sometimes instrumental in drawing international financial aid \\nand investment. But he was faulted for declining living standards \\nat home and a rise in corruption in government. Lahoud pledged in \\na tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. \\nThe general enjoys widespread popular backing after succeeding in \\nrebuilding an army fractured by civil war. Central bank officials \\non Monday tried to calm fears about a run on the Lebanese pound by \\nannouncing that the bank was ready to intervene with its foreign currency \\nreserves if necessary, the state-run National News Agency reported. \\nIt added that the money markets remained stable. \\n\\nThe commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president \\nafter winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon. \\n``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime Minister \\nRafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation \\nMonday that was headlined on the front-page of the leftist newspaper \\nAs-Safir. Lebanese media said the matter was settled Monday at a meeting \\nin Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President \\nHafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller neighbor. \\nAgriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said Tuesday \\nthat Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member Parliament \\nat an extraordinary session on Oct. 15. The election is a formality \\nsince other candidates have little chance now that Syria has thrown \\nits weight behind Gen. Lahoud. In another formality before the election, \\nthe Parliament will amend the constitution, which forbids senior public \\nservants from running for president. The new president must be sworn \\nin on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office at the end of his six-year \\nterm. The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a 55-year-old \\ntradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime minister \\na Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Agreement \\namong the three officials is essential for the smooth running of the \\ngovernment. Since Lahoud has a good relationship with Hariri and Speaker \\nNabih Berri, little change was expected in government policy. Lahoud's \\nnomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of the next head \\nof state. Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and \\nthe United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home \\nand has good relations with Syria. But the choice could not have been \\nsealed before a final say from Assad, who keeps 30,000 troops in this \\ncountry. His word is referred to in the Beirut media as ``the password.'' \\nLahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army commander \\nin 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 \\ncivil war, is credited with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese \\narmy and in ending the reign of militias. In Lebanon, the army commander \\nheads the air force, navy and the ground forces. Many hope he will \\ncopy his success with the military in government, which is plagued \\nby nepotism and waste of public funds. But some fear that a military \\nman in the nation's highest office could mean a return to the use \\nof intelligence services to track civilian life _ the case under Fouad \\nChehab, the only other army commander to become president, who ruled \\nfrom 1958 to 1964. ``The election of a military man is a threat to \\ndemocracy in Lebanon,'' Raymond Edde, a Christian politician living \\nin self-imposed exile in France, told the An-Nahar newspaper. \\n\\nPrime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business tycoon who launched Lebanon's \\nmultibillion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of civil war, \\nsaid Monday he was bowing out as premier following a dispute with \\nthe new president.

Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term \\non Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office. \\n\\nPrime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office \\nhave hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment \\nfrom new President Emile Lahoud. Hariri is still the front-runner \\nto form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted \\nsources as saying that Hariri was ``outraged'' that only 62 of the \\n128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a \\nmeeting with Lahoud Friday. According to the constitution, a president \\nmust begin his term by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet \\nthrough a decree issued after consulting with Parliament members. \\nA presidential decree was expected Friday but nothing came through \\nafter a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri. Hariri had even scheduled \\nFriday a traditional meeting between the prime minister-designate \\nand former prime ministers, but that was canceled. The state-run National \\nNews Agency said that while only 62 deputies told Lahoud they supported \\nHariri, the rest refused to divulge their choice or left it to the \\npresident to decide. A TV station owned by Hariri said he won the \\nbacking of at least 100 deputies. The delay reflects the tug-of-war \\namong the power brokers in the country. Under a formula aimed at preventing \\nthe recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war, power in Lebanon is shared \\nequally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister \\nand a Shiite Parliament speaker. While the Christian Lahoud may have \\nno objection to appointing the Sunni Hariri, it is possible that Parliament \\nSpeaker Nabih Berri's 19 Shiite supporters in the legislature are \\nholding out to emphasize their value. The leading An-Nahar and other \\nnewspapers said the delay could last for days. But in the end, it \\nis Hariri that is most likely to be renamed on the strength of his \\nrecord in office. Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, has almost single-handedly \\ncreated a multibillion dollar program to rebuild a country destroyed \\nby the civil war. He is also credited with stabilizing the currency \\nand restoring confidence in the postwar economy. But his government \\nunder former president Elias Hrawi were dogged by accusations of corruption. \\nHariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed three \\ntimes during the extended term of former President Elias Hrawi. He \\nhas remained in office as caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded \\nHrawi on Tuesday. Lahoud, a general who as army commander rebuilt \\nthe military from 1989 until his election by Parliament in October, \\nhas pledged in his inauguration speech Tuesday to clean up the corruption-plagued \\nadministration. \\n\\nPrime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from \\nLebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political \\ncrisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war. \\nSources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker \\ncapacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, \\nsaid Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new \\nCabinet. There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing \\nHariri as prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining \\ntactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership, the \\napparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's \\neconomic stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, \\n53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction \\nprogram, has been in power since 1992. A billionaire businessman who \\nmade his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring \\neconomic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. Lahoud, \\n62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to power with widespread \\npopular backing, pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up \\nthe graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made \\nhis name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. \\nPrevious disputes among government leaders have cost the Central Bank \\nhundreds of millions of dollars in its efforts to stabilize the Lebanese \\npound. Such political disputes in Lebanon in the past were solved \\nonly with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this \\ncountry. Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud had been \\nexpected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to \\nform the next government. The decree was to be issued after the president \\npolled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime \\nminister. But many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming \\nsupport to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president \\nto select a prime minister. The two leaders met Friday, but no presidential \\ndecree followed. The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition \\nof anonymity, said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because \\nhe did not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in \\nselecting the premier. The Hariri camp argues that the president can \\npoll Parliament members on their choice for prime minister but cannot \\naccept a mandate to name a person of his choice. The dispute, in fact, \\nappears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will \\nbe governed during Lahoud's six-year term. Toward the end of former \\nPresident Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually had \\na free hand in running the country. \\n\\nA Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized \\nthe Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said \\nhe will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive \\npost. Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he \\nand his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member \\nParliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23. Although \\na boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party will hardly spoil \\nthe chances of Gen. Emile Lahoud, it could embolden others to express \\ndiscontent at the choice and the process of his election. Lahoud is \\nvirtually assured of the job: the prime minister and the parliament \\nspeaker first approved Lahoud, who then won the all-important backing \\nof Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. ``Historically, we do \\nnot approve that a military man takes control of the country,'' Jumblatt \\ntold reporters after a meeting with outgoing President Elias Hrawi. \\nAlthough opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics is common \\namong anti-Syrian politicians, it is rare for somebody like Jumblatt \\nto openly speak against a decision personally cleared by Syrian President \\nHafez Assad who keeps 30,000 troops in Lebanon. Like Jumblatt, some \\nin Lebanon fear that a military man as president could mean intelligence \\nagents will track civilian life just as they did between 1958 and \\n1964 during the presidency of Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander \\nto become head of state. In nominating Lahoud, ``rules were not respected,'' \\nJumblatt said. ``Things were supposed to run in a more democratic \\nway,'' said Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought Christian forces \\nduring the 1975-90 civil war. The new president must be sworn in on \\nNov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office after a six-year term. Jumblatt \\nsaid ``there is adequate political diversity and competition in the \\ncountry,'' implying that choosing a military man for president was \\nunnecessary. Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr sought to calm fears \\nabout military intrusion. He told reporters that Lahoud will ``keep \\nthe army out of politics just as he kept politics out of the army.'' \\nLahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and political \\nsupport at home and has good relations with Syria. He gained public \\nadmiration for reuniting an army fractured by civil war and in ending \\nthe reign of militias. Many hope he will cleanse the government of \\nnepotism and wastage of public funds. Lahoud's nomination complies \\nwith a tradition that the president be a Maronite Christian, the prime \\nminister a Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. The \\ngovernment is run by the joint efforts of the three officials. Jumblatt \\nsaid his party will also boycott a Parliamentary session to amend \\nthe Constitution so that senior public servants can run for president. \\nCriticism of the nomination process also came from a meeting of Catholic \\nbishops on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the bishops welcomed the choice \\nof Lahoud, a fellow Catholic, a statement said. \\n\\nPrime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from \\nLebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political \\ncrisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war. \\nSources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker \\ncapacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, \\nsaid Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new \\nCabinet.

When there was no shot to take, he invented a new one. \\nWhen there was no one to pass to, he reconfigured the play until a \\nteammate was open. Larry Bird, in the Indiana countryside or inside \\nBoston Garden, was a luminous exception to the governing rule. That \\nis why, six years after his retirement from the National Basketball \\nAssociation, his name is again basketball's most prominent, beginning \\nwith his induction to the Hall of Fame before 7,000 Bird watchers \\nat the Civic Center here on Friday night. Deservedly enshrined as \\nforever exceptional, he again becomes Bird, the exception, the case \\nstudy for a contentious and potentially disastrous labor war. ``No, \\nnot really,'' Bird said, when I asked whether he is troubled by the \\nlikelihood of his legendary name soon representing a symbol of greed \\nto unsympathetic millions. ``There's always a player's name attached \\nto these things. I know at the time I was very happy about it.'' That \\nwould have been 1988, when the Celtics wanted to compensate Bird with \\na $4.9 million bonus to push through his back pain, go on as their \\nsavior. Three years later, in a contract arbitration involving the \\nKnicks' Patrick Ewing, the agent David Falk would contend that the \\nNBA conspired with the Celtics to circumvent the salary cap, in order \\nto satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I am sure, would agree that this \\nsalary cap is convoluted enough to give anyone a headache, so let's \\njust say it is a cap that does not exist when a team is negotiating \\nwith one of its own. The process of unsealing the cap to re-sign a \\nparticular player eventually became known as making use of the Larry \\nBird exception. And that is where we stand, as this onetime exception \\nhas become the very expensive rule the owners don't want to play by \\nanymore. ``I can understand both sides,'' said Bird, safely in the \\nmiddle, between Bird, the former exception, and Bird, the present \\nIndiana Pacers' coach. ``Without getting into the exception, I think \\nit's very important for players to stay in the same place.'' Important, \\nhe meant, for franchise stability and fan identification. ``You have \\na son who is 7 years old, he goes from 7 to 17 in the 10 years you've \\nplayed,'' Bird said. ``A lot of people in Boston told me that they \\nhad followed me, from the time they were very young to when they were \\nin college.'' The Bird years numbered only three Celtics championships, \\nbut he was the best player pro basketball's most famous team ever \\nhad. He and Magic Johnson created a basketball renaissance that began \\nduring a college title showdown in Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, \\nlike an infectious smile. They stood for the pass, for team play, \\nbut now their decade of selflessness has given way to one of selfishness. \\nThe NBA of Michael Jordan reached greater heights than anyone imagined \\nit could, but it is a league that now suffers from a sickness of the \\nsoul. ``If Larry and Magic hadn't done what they did, we might not \\nsurvive what we're about to go through,'' said Bill Fitch, Bird's \\nfirst Celtics coach, who, with Bill Walton, stood with him on the \\nnight that, he said, gave closure to his playing career. The owners, \\nas always, are exaggerating their misery, but this time, it is much \\neasier to not root for the players. The president of the union is \\nEwing, who one day commands players to boycott the world championships \\nbecause the NBA's corporate fingerprints are on them, then the next \\nday helps himself to some television commentary work for David Stern's \\nwomen's annex. Ewing leads the fight to protect the $100 million contracts \\nfor 21-year-olds who have achieved not a single playoff victory, linked \\nto the big payoffs for agents like his friend Falk. The battle is \\nwaged in the name of a salary cap that makes exceptions of the unexceptional, \\nrewards everyone as if they were Bird. ``I believe that in any field \\nthere has to be an allowance for the truly special ones,'' Walton \\nsaid. ``But that group is very small. When I was growing up in this \\nsport, the only players who got the recognition were the champions, \\nthe ones who always made you feel good about the game, about sports. \\nThat's how Larry and Magic played, always dreaming of the special \\nteam. It wasn't about hype, about money.'' That is not quite the case, \\nnor should it have been. Bird was a businessman's ball player from \\nthe day he arrived, with his flannel shirts and blue-collar ethic. \\nHe hired the late Bob Woolf, one of the original heavy-hitting agents, \\nand got himself a record rookie contract. Then he went out and turned \\na 29-victory catastrophe into a 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, \\nan honest exception to the rule. \\n\\nMore than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed \\ncontracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during \\nthe management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that \\nmay affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have \\nmajor ramifications on American sports-labor law. But neither the \\nplayers nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, \\nJohn Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds \\nin favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million \\nin salaries. NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the \\ndecision goes against management, they will seek to have it vacated \\nby appealing to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and then, if \\nnecessary, to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a process that \\ncould prevent the players from getting paid for several months. The \\nNBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season \\nbecause of the labor dispute. The league has other litigation pending \\nin U.S. District Court in Manhattan. If the players win the ruling, \\nthe NBA intends to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick. The motion \\nwas brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining \\nagreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction to hear the \\nmatter. ``If he rules in our favor, I think it emboldens the spirit \\nand the resolve of the players,'' said Billy Hunter, union executive \\ndirector. ``But we understand that won't end the lockout. It just \\nmeans they have to pay 200-some players. And there is still other \\nlitigation alive that may take a while to resolve. At most, it's a \\nhollow victory.'' Feerick will have taken the full 30 days to render \\nhis decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully. \\nThere is no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid. During the \\nNBA summer lockout of 1995, players who missed paychecks did not file \\na grievance. Neither did National Hockey League players who were locked \\nout for the first three months of the 1994-95 season. The union argued \\nthat owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses \\nabout non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player \\ncontracts. In support of its arguments, the union pointed to clauses \\nin a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding \\npayment during a lockout. The league is relying on the basic tenets \\nof labor law, which hold that employees not be paid during strikes \\nor lockouts. A ruling for the union would be significant for all future \\nnegotiations between players and owners. The deterrent factor of a \\nlockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement \\ndo not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to \\nreach a new agreement. If Feerick finds in favor of the players, there \\nwill be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts \\nto reach an agreement quickly. They would essentially be paid for \\nnot playing basketball. If Feerick finds in favor of the owners, the \\nreality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement \\nmore quickly. But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference \\ncall Friday talked openly about the entire season's being canceled \\nbefore the players would back away from their ultimate goals. ``I'm \\nnot at all concerned,'' Hunter said. ``There's been no demonstration \\nthat there's going to be a change in our resolve. After the players \\nsaw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA \\nowners, well, I had two players call me up and tell me, if need be, \\nthey'd be willing to hock everything they've got.'' Another significant \\ndevelopment may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the \\ndispute is settled, according to at least two player agents. ``I think \\nit would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's already some people \\ntalking about that,'' said Bill Strickland, a member of the union's \\nagents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee, \\nsaid he would explore the possibility that one client, Nets center \\nRony Seikaly, would sign with a professional team in Greece. ``We \\nwouldn't look to void his deal with the team,'' Kauffman said. ``But \\nwe would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until \\nhe could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy \\ncommissioner, said the league has approved the idea of players' earning \\na living elsewhere until the lockout is settled. Proposals exchanged \\nlast week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player \\nsalaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations \\nsince the lockout began July 1. But both sides have termed the figures \\nin each other's proposal as unacceptable, and it was unclear whether \\neither side was willing compromise. ``I don't think we should get \\ntoo carried away about the possibilities just yet,'' Granik said. \\n``When they explored the idea of a tax system, we were taking the \\nplayers at their word that they wanted to make some headway. But to \\ncall their first proposal meaningless is charitable. They proposed \\nsomething that has no impact. As it stands, that can't be the solution.'' \\nThe owners' goal is to slow the growth of player salaries in relation \\nto leaguewide revenue over the next three years, while the players \\nwant to keep earning as much as possible. \\n\\nIn a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association \\nand the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether \\nmore than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during \\nthe lockout. If the players win, the owners will be liable for about \\ndlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed \\nto appeal if they lose. The league already has sued the players over \\nFeerick's jurisdiction. ``If we win, I think it just emboldens the \\nspirit and resolve of the players,'' union director Billy Hunter said. \\n``But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's \\nno guarantee that it will end the lockout. ``It only means they have \\nto pay some 200 players, and they've indicated to us their intent \\nto file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in \\norder to avoid payment. ``So even if he does rule in our favor, at \\nmost it's a hollow victory. The players aren't going to get paid Nov. \\n15 in any circumstance,'' Hunter said. If the owners win, it will \\nremove the last wild card the players had been holding. The sides \\nhave not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union proposed a \\nsuperstar tax on the highest contracts. The league made a counterproposal \\nFriday, asking that the tax be imposed with a much lower threshold. \\nHunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon, \\nthen said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling. \\nIt's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the union \\nis holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee \\nin Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday. ``We've got to get a sense \\nof where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and \\nwhat they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence,'' \\nHunter said. The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout \\nwas imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they \\nwould not honor guaranteed deals. In a six-day hearing over the summer, \\nthe union argued that owners should have protected themselves from \\nbeing liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting \\nlockout language into the standard player contract. The Sacramento \\nKings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract \\nin 1994, and it was approved by the league. The union used the existence \\nof that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protected \\nthemselves similarly. Most players are due to receive their first \\npaychecks Nov. 15, although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them \\nto be paid over the summer. None has received a paycheck. The NBA \\nargued that a tenet of labor law allows employers to withhold pay \\nfrom employees during a lockout. The league also called former union \\ndirector Simon Gourdine to testify. He said it was his understanding \\nwhen he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would \\nnot be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose \\na lockout. \\n\\nAs labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball \\nAssociation and its players is weird even by sports standards. There \\nis a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season \\nwill be canceled. In this union battle it is the interests of the \\nbest paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the \\ndiscussion. And here it is some of the workers, not the management, \\nwho are considering trying to make the union disappear. The current \\narrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions. \\nLast year more players than ever before received the union minimum, \\nthen $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans. The number of \\nplayers making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class, \\nin NBA terms _ fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. \\nThis should not be a surprise. Sports is an entertainment business, \\nnot unlike movies. Big stars get millions, while most get union scale. \\nOver the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed. \\nThe most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its \\nown free agent for whatever it is willing to pay. When that was adopted, \\nit was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could \\npay. But it has not worked out that way. In the current negotiation, \\nthe league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 \\npercent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, \\nand says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players \\nwant, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises \\nfor veterans. The union says it is worried about that middle class, \\nbut seems determined to preserve the free market. The league got its \\nbroadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, to agree to pay \\nthis year's television fees whether or not there are any games to \\nbroadcast. (They will be paid back in later years, either through \\nreduced fees or extra games to show.) Owners hoped the players would \\nthink management was willing to wait them out, and come to terms with \\nonly a small part of the season canceled. But the union is acting \\nunhurried. It turned aside requests for negotiations this week, saying \\nthe players had to meet first. Then there is the issue of union suicide, \\na tactic that was rejected by the players in 1995. The idea is that \\nif the players had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws \\nfor the owners to collude. The sky would be the limit. That tactic \\nmight fail. The courts could reject a union decertification vote as \\na sham, and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel \\nfree to offer less than the old union minimum. But if the players \\ngo that route, it could be a long time before real negotiations get \\ngoing. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warned the owners \\nthis week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's popularity. \\nThat was what all the seers said four years ago, when baseball's World \\nSeries was canceled by labor troubles. But fan memories are relatively \\nshort, and now baseball seems more popular than ever. With that in \\nmind, both owners and players may choose to battle on for months. \\n\\nIn a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work stoppage \\nin National Basketball Association history, the league Monday announced \\nthe cancellation of all 114 preseason games. Citing stalled negotiations \\nwith the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, \\nleague officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel \\nthe first week of regular season games. While the decision had been \\nexpected for 10 days, it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the \\nowners and players will probably be willing to cancel at least part \\nof the regular season in order to settle their labor dispute. Both \\nsides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated \\ntraining camps and sign over 200 free agents to new contracts. Privately, \\nofficials on both sides do not believe the season will start as scheduled \\non Nov. 3 or even before December. Unlike Major League Baseball, the \\nNational Football League and the National Hockey League, the NBA has \\nnever lost a regular-season game to labor strife. ``Since we're not \\neven negotiating, you have to conclude it's very likely that we're \\ngoing miss some part of the regular season,'' deputy commissioner \\nRuss Granik said Monday night. ``We'll try and defer any decisions \\nuntil the last minute, but right now it does not look good.'' The \\ntwo sides will meet on Thursday _ their first official bargaining \\nsession since Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern and a group of owners \\nwalked out of a meeting after dismissing the merits of a new proposal \\nfrom the players. Neither Granik nor players association executive \\ndirector Billy Hunter sounded as if this week's meeting would go a \\nlong way toward the signing of a new agreement _ the precursor to \\nplaying again. ``I don't think you have any choice but to miss games \\nat this point,'' Hunter said. ``In fact, I think the they've intended \\nit all along. They've locked us out, they've refused to negotiate \\nand they've given us a proposal that's ludicrous.'' Not only are both \\nsides still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is \\ndue before Oct. 18 - the Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will \\nrule whether or not more than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed \\ncontracts should be paid during the lockout _ but the owners and players \\nalso are making time to win public opinion before they test their \\nfans' loyalties by canceling games. Monday in 11 cities throughout \\nthe country, the players are holding make-shift press conferences \\nat training-camp venues, NBA arenas and gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, \\nthe union president, and several teammates will speak at SUNY-Purchase \\nin Purchase, N.Y., where the Knicks train during the season. With \\ntraining camp originally scheduled to open on Oct. 6, the message \\nfrom the players is clear: if the owners would call an end to the \\nlockout, we would be ready to play today. About 100 players are expected \\nto attend, speak and sign autographs for fans afterward. ``I wish \\nthey would put their energies into trying to negotiate a deal rather \\nthan the various other things that they've been doing,'' Granik said. \\nThe dispute is essentially over how the owners and players will judiciously \\ndivvy up $2 billion in income. It began last year with the contention \\nby the owners that their employees were receiving more than their \\nfair share of the pot. The owners were allowed to terminate the current \\nagreement because of a clause that enabled them to do so after player \\nsalaries reached 53.8 percent of total basketball-related income. \\nThe owners say that figure is currently hovering around 57.1 percent. \\nThough many economic issues need to be resolved, the main point of \\ncontention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared \\na lockout on July 1 has been a clause which allows teams to pay their \\nown free agents whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rules \\ngoverning the NBA's 29 teams. Called the Larry Bird exception, it \\nwas created to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re-sign \\nwith the Celtics near the end of his career. Michael Jordan exercised \\nthe clause the last two years with the Chicago Bulls, earning more \\nthan $30 million per season _ figures more than $5 million more what \\na team is allowed to spend on all its players. But with exorbitant \\nsalaries paid to several unproven stars over the last few years and \\n$100 million deals sprouting up routinely, the owners are determined \\nto swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a \\nrestricted salary cap _ a hard cap _ and putting a ceiling on how \\nmuch one player could earn. ``Last year, the players received about \\n$1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals \\nthat are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the \\nnext four years,'' Granik said in a prepared statement. ``Our proposals \\nwould result in an average player salary of more than $3.1 million \\nand a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of $750,000. Unfortunately, \\nthe union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration \\nto what we have offered.'' Hunter labeled those claims as optimistic \\nprojections, and shot down a number of new proposals presented to \\nthe players on Sept. 25. ``If they had left the current deal in place, \\nwe would have gotten much of that anyway,'' he added. ``All we're \\nsaying is, we're not in position to accept a hard cap.'' Monday's \\ndecision to cancel the preseason came less than two weeks after the \\nNBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled the first week \\nof exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated \\nthat losing the exhibition season would cost the league between $35 \\nmillion and $40 million. Decisions about the cancellations of regular \\nseason games are expected to be made next week, he added. A league \\nofficial said the games would be canceled in blocks of one or two \\nweeks, depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations. Thursday's \\nbargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the \\nseason on time. ``Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, but I have \\nno reason to believe they will on Thursday,'' Granik said. Added Hunter: \\n``Of course they don't expect much to get done. When Russ and David \\ndecide the negotiations are going to be real and substantive, then \\nsomething will happen. What they're banking on now is that the players \\nare going to miss paychecks and cave in November. It's as if they've \\ningested something that has to pass. And once it passes, then they'll \\nnegotiate.'' \\n\\nPatrick Ewing did not want to sound like a striking longshoreman demanding \\nhealth benefits. ``I'm not going to try and put it in dollars and \\ncents.'' But Ewing, president of the National Basketball Association \\nPlayers Association, played the public-relations game Tuesday by expounding \\non the themes of labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted \\nproposals. On the day when training camps were scheduled to begin, \\nplayers from across the country held news conferences in 14 NBA cities \\nto proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season. ``We \\nwant to show the public that we, as players, want to play,'' said \\nEwing, who was flanked by five teammates. ``Today is supposed to be \\nthe start of training camp. We want to practice and we want the season \\nto start. But unfortunately, the owners have locked us out and the \\nseason has been postponed.'' The owners and players are scheduled \\nhold their first bargaining session since Aug. 6 on Thursday in Manhattan. \\nNeither side is predicting progress toward signing a new collective \\nbargaining agreement and beginning the season as scheduled on Nov. \\n3. The league canceled the entire 114-game preseason on Monday. Next \\nweek, it will consider canceling the first-ever regular season games \\nin league history. With wide philosophical differences on how $2 billion \\nannual income should be distributed, both sides have privately said \\nthey don't expect to play a regular season game before December. Billy \\nHunter, the union's executive director, offered a glimmer of hope. \\nHe spoke optimistically about the potential for a quick resolution. \\nStanding a few feet away from Ewing, he said, ``I hope the owners \\nand commissioner have gotten the message: that we're serious about \\na deal. I'm prepared to make a quantum leap. I don't think we're that \\nfar off. I think there's a lot jockeying, a lot of rhetoric and a \\nlot of games being played. But if and when the owners decide they \\nwant a deal, then they'll get one.'' But soon after, he began lambasting \\nthe owners' latest proposal, which includes the eventual phasing out \\nof the Larry Bird exception _ the clause that enables free agents \\nto earn unlimited salaries from their current teams. That clause represents \\nthe major rift in negotiations. Owners would like to implement a restrictive \\nsalary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player \\ncan earn. ``I don't know if this is going to come to a speedy resolution,'' \\nEwing said. ``They're entrenched with what they want, which is a hard \\ncap. And we feel with a hard cap, we as players, cannot survive. We \\nwould have to be stupid and ignorant to accept that deal.'' Said Hunter, \\n``If you go for their proposal, it's just a joke. It's a step backwards. \\nI cannot understand it. If the intent was to reach an agreement at \\nthis late stage or to negotiate in earnest, this was the wrong way \\nto go about it.'' League officials did not respond to the players' \\ncomments. ``All we want is our fair share and we feel like they're \\ntrying to take that away from us,'' Ewing said. `There's a perception \\nthat we're on strike. It's the other way around. We've been locked \\nout.'' Besides Ewing, the other Knicks included former union president \\nBuck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston \\nand John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed up briefly. When the media \\nhorde closed in, however, the third-year forward went to look for \\nhis late-arriving teammates inside the practice facility. He was stopped \\nat the gym door, which was locked. ``They locked us out,'' said Rockets \\nforward Mario Elie. ``Everybody's got to get that corrected. It's \\nnot on us. They're the ones that closed us down.'' The stalemate has \\nelicited talks of possibly bringing in a mediator in the coming weeks, \\nas Major League Baseball did in 1994 to help solve its labor dispute. \\nBut the players are convinced commissioner David Stern and the owners \\nare set on testing their resolve before any genuine headway can be \\nmade in negotiations. That means missing paychecks in November, something \\nEwing said the players are prepared to do. Both sides are still awaiting \\nthe outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct. 18. \\nFordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more \\nthan 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed contracts should \\nbe paid during the lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage \\nto one side. But if the players lose the arbitration, more than 400 \\nathletes _ many with extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial \\nobligations _ will have their allegiances instantly tested. ``It's \\nlike they want to see how strong we are,'' Ewing said. ``Based on \\nthe proposals we've received, we're very strong.'' ``So far, it seems \\nas though the NBA is dug in on their position,'' Buck Williams said. \\n``I don't think they're too concerned at this point about making a \\ndeal. He added, ``We're about as far apart as the Grand Canyon right \\nnow.'' \\n\\nThe first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing \\nsides of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute came \\nand went Thursday without a hint of a settlement. Still, a five-hour \\nmeeting that was described as cordial by the league and ``almost like \\ntwo bulls letting off a little steam'' by the players association \\nproduced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday. Barring a \\nmajor compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full \\nseason and prevent the league from losing its first regular-season \\ngames to labor strife in November. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, \\nsaid the league would wait until after next week's meeting before \\ndeciding to cancel regular-season games. He also discussed the possibility \\nof a significantly shortened season. ``We haven't made a determination \\nthat you need this exact number of games in order to have a representative \\nseason,'' Granik said. ``But we recognize that beyond a certain point \\nwe can't possibly sell to our fans that we're having an NBA season. \\n``Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. \\nWe have a few months before we have to face that decision.'' Perhaps \\nthe only progress involved Thursday in the conference room of a midtown \\nManhattan hotel was a question-and-answer session over the league's \\nlatest proposal to the players. Patrick Ewing, the union president, \\nand vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the \\nmeeting with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union \\nlawyers. No owners were present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern \\nand the league's lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies \\nof a two-week-old proposal to the players. At one point before the \\ntwo parties broke for lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voices \\nand accused each other of handling their constituencies poorly, a \\nparticipant in the meeting said. But the two were seen shaking hands \\nand laughing after the meeting concluded shortly after 3 p.m. ``There \\nwas some venting from both sides,'' Hunter said. ``We've been placid \\nand very respectful. Today, we took the coats off and we were inclined \\nto take the gloves off a little bit. Having done that, I think it \\nkind of loosened up both sides.'' Hunter added: ``Did anybody blink \\ntoday? They're sort of look at us for any kind of nuance they can \\nfind during the course of negotiations that might, in some way or \\nanother, give some indication that while we're mouthing one thing \\nwe might be open to something else. We're looking at their body language, \\ntoo. I don't think that they're ready to make a deal.'' The last formal \\nmeeting between both sides on Aug. 6 ended when Stern and the owners \\nabruptly marched out after they had received a proposal from the players. \\n\\nDespite modest encouragement over a new proposal delivered by the \\nplayers to the owners, the National Basketball Association Tuesday \\ncanceled the first two weeks of the regular season, the first time \\nin the league's 51-year history that it will lose games to a labor \\ndispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the \\ncancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded \\nat a Manhattan hotel. The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. \\n3 and Nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation \\nof a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners \\nsaid they would respond to by Friday. ``We tried our best today to \\ntry to do what was possible to salvage the season,'' said Alonzo Mourning, \\nthe Miami Heat center. ``Unfortunately, it didn't work out.'' After \\n35,001 games without a blemish, the NBA now joins the National Hockey \\nLeague, the National Football League and Major League Baseball in \\nhaving lost games to a labor dispute. Taking into account that a three- \\nto four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent \\nsignings before the season starts, the league said it would decide \\nin two weeks whether to make further cancellations. ``I'm very sad \\nand disappointed,'' said the NBA commissioner, David Stern. ``I consider \\nit to be a collective failure, but I honestly don't know what else \\nwe could have done. I do things that I like to think are in the best \\ninterests of the game. And I believe this is.'' The decision came \\nafter what both sides agreed were the most substantive talks since \\nthe owners imposed a lockout on the player July 1. Seventeen players, \\nincluding union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch \\nRichmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended \\nthe meeting along with Stern, Granik and five members of the ownership \\ncommittee _ Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners \\nAbe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander \\nof Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix. The talks featured what \\nthe players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the \\nowners that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing \\nthe revenue pendulum back toward the owners. The dispute involves \\nthe distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income. \\nThe main sticking point has been the owners' insistence on a salary \\ncap without exceptions, the implementation of which they believe would \\nbring player salaries' in line with revenue growth. While the players \\ndid not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception _ a clause \\nthat allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re-signing \\nwith his current team _ they did address the exception in their taxation \\nproposal. The main points were as follows: _ A 50 percent tax would \\nbe imposed on salary earned above $18 million, a clause that would \\naffect only a few players who exercised their Bird rights. For example, \\nif a player made $20 million, the team would be forced to put $1 million \\ninto a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams. \\n``There could be provisions made for some players,'' said Jeffrey \\nKessler, the chief outside counsel for the union. ``We don't want \\nto do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting Michael Jordan \\nback. And I think the league feels the same way.'' The proposal is \\nsimilar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in 1995 during negotiations, \\nbut it would not be nearly as liberal. _ A salary cap credit would \\ngo into effect if the league pays out more than 63 percent of revenues \\nin salary. Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap \\nthe next year. If the figure was $29 million over the salary cap, \\nthen the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $1 million less than \\nthe previous season. But the players would have an assurance that \\nthe salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit goes \\ninto effect. _ Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction \\nof annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts. \\nPlayers would either get raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth \\nin league revenues. The union said this clearly addresses the league's \\ndesire to bring salaries in line with revenues. Since the owners re-opened \\nthe current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward \\nsalaries, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially \\nfor the owners to agree to such a proposal. _ Teams would get a right \\nof first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming \\nrookies, meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the \\nsame team for the first four years of his deal. Currently, the rookie \\nscale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to \\nexercise his Bird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett \\nparlayed into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. \\n_ Finally, the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance. \\nDetails of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions \\ntook place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drugs, a provision \\nthe owners included in their last proposal. In return for the concessions, \\nthe players want an increase in the minimum salary _ currently $272,500 \\n_ and creation of an average salary exception. This would allow every \\nteam above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year \\nfor the average salary _ currently $2.6 million. ``We're buoyed by \\nthe fact for the first time they've decided to submit a counterproposal,'' \\nthe union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. ``I don't know \\nif I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers \\nin the eye and say we made a valiant effort.'' Asked if the players \\nwould finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games, \\nHunter added: ``It's not about us blinking. We want to reach an agreement. \\nWe're tired of the rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing. Our \\nposition all along has been we don't want to accept a bad deal.'' \\nGranik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month \\nand that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason \\ngames. He estimated the losses into the ``hundreds of millions of \\ndollars.'' ``I think we have serious concern whether a tax system \\ncan address the kind of needs we have economically,'' he added. ``But \\nthere's some possibility.'' Added Stern, ``We owe it to the fans to \\ngo back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve \\nthe result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're going to \\nspend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response.'' \\nThough the decision to cancel games was not surprising, it did represent \\na major shift in prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered \\nout a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole \\nnotion of not missing games and preserving the NBA's perfect record. \\nTuesday, they could not come to such an accord. ``I'd like to think \\nthese our the last games we have to cancel,'' Granik said. ``But unless \\nthis or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, \\nI think that is certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy.'' \\n\\nIn a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association \\nand the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether \\nmore than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during \\nthe lockout. If the players win, the owners will be liable for about \\ndlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed \\nto appeal if they lose. The league already has sued the players over \\nFeerick's jurisdiction. ``If we win, I think it just emboldens the \\nspirit and resolve of the players,'' union director Billy Hunter said. \\n``But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's \\nno guarantee that it will end the lockout. ``It only means they have \\nto pay some 200 players, and they've indicated to us their intent \\nto file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in \\norder to avoid payment. ``So even if he does rule in our favor, at \\nmost it's a hollow victory. The players aren't going to get paid Nov. \\n15 in any circumstance,'' Hunter said. If the owners win, it will \\nremove the last wild card the players had been holding. The sides \\nhave not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union proposed a \\nsuperstar tax on the highest contracts. The league made a counterproposal \\nFriday, asking that the tax be imposed with a much lower threshold. \\nHunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon, \\nthen said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling. \\nIt's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the union \\nis holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee \\nin Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday. ``We've got to get a sense \\nof where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and \\nwhat they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence,'' \\nHunter said. The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout \\nwas imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they \\nwould not honor guaranteed deals. In a six-day hearing over the summer, \\nthe union argued that owners should have protected themselves from \\nbeing liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting \\nlockout language into the standard player contract. The Sacramento \\nKings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract \\nin 1994, and it was approved by the league. The union used the existence \\nof that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protected \\nthemselves similarly. Most players are due to receive their first \\npaychecks Nov. 15, although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them \\nto be paid over the summer. None has received a paycheck. The NBA \\nargued that a tenet of labor law allows employers to withhold pay \\nfrom employees during a lockout. The league also called former union \\ndirector Simon Gourdine to testify, but Feerick upheld union objections \\nand prohibited Gourdine from saying whether it was his understanding \\nwhen he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would \\nnot be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose \\na lockout. \\n\\nThe National Basketball Association, embroiled in a labor dispute \\nwith its players, Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the 1998-99 \\nseason. It is the first time in the league's 51-year history that \\nit will lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, \\nRuss Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half \\nhours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel. The decision to \\ncancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the players \\nassociation proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of \\na hard salary cap, a proposal the owners said they would respond to \\nby Friday. ``We tried our best today to try to do what was possible \\nto salvage the season,'' said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center. \\n``Unfortunately, it didn't work out.'' After 35,001 games without \\na blemish, the NBA now joins the National Hockey League, the National \\nFootball League and Major League Baseball in having lost games to \\na labor dispute. Taking into account that a three- to four-week period \\nwould be needed for training camp and free-agent signings before the \\nseason starts, the league said it would decide in two weeks whether \\nto make further cancellations. ``I'm very sad and disappointed,'' \\nsaid the NBA commissioner, David Stern. ``I consider it to be a collective \\nfailure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I \\ndo things that I like to think are in the best interests of the game. \\nAnd I believe this is.'' The decision came after what both sides agreed \\nwere the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout \\non the player July 1. Seventeen players, including union president \\nPatrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe \\nMutombo and Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik \\nand five members of the ownership committee _ Madison Square Garden \\npresident Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon \\nGund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of \\nPhoenix. The talks featured what the players association implied were \\na bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate \\nthe league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the \\nowners. The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2 \\nbillion in league-wide income. The main sticking point has been the \\nowners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the implementation \\nof which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue \\ngrowth. While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry \\nBird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount \\nof money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did address \\nthe exception in their taxation proposal. The main points were as \\nfollows: _ A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above \\n$18 million, a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised \\ntheir Bird rights. For example, if a player made $20 million, the \\nteam would be forced to put $1 million into a fund that would most \\nlikely be distributed to low-revenue teams. ``There could be provisions \\nmade for some players,'' said Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel \\nfor the union. ``We don't want to do anything that would encourage \\nChicago from getting Michael Jordan back. And I think the league feels \\nthe same way.'' The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed \\nby the union in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly \\nas liberal. _ A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league \\npays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary. Whatever figure \\nover that number reduces the salary cap the next year. If the figure \\nwas $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work \\nwith a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season. But the \\nplayers would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at \\nleast $2 million before the credit goes into effect. _ Also, if the \\n63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raises \\nwould take effect for multi-year contracts. Players would either get \\nraises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues. The \\nunion said this clearly addresses the league's desire to bring salaries \\nin line with revenues. Since the owners re-opened the current agreement \\nbecause 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries, the 63-percent \\nfigure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners \\nto agree to such a proposal. _ Teams would get a right of first refusal \\non free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, meaning \\na player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the \\nfirst four years of his deal. Currently, the rookie scale is three \\nyears and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his \\nBird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into \\nan astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. _ Finally, \\nthe players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance.

Kuchma urged the economists to come up with recommendations \\nbefore a national meeting of economists in November, the Interfax \\nnews agency reported. Ukraine has suffered economic problems since \\nthe 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and it has been especially hard \\nhit by the financial crisis in neighboring Russia, its main trading \\npartner. The Russian crisis has hurt bilateral trade, caused the Ukrainian \\ncurrency to fall and led to a withdrawal of investors from Ukraine. \\nIn recent months, Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms by \\ndecree, prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the first \\ninstallment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many reforms, \\nhowever, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko \\nwas in Washington this week for consultations with IMF officials. \\nYushchenko has warned that the bank would not spend its dwindling \\nreserves to support the hryvna currency, but has avoided comments \\non the currency in recent days. Kuchma met Friday with Yushchenko, \\nPrime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior officials to \\ndiscuss ways to stabilize the hryvna. The government's press service \\nsaid they focused on possible ways to keep the hryvna under 3.5 to \\nthe U.S. dollar through the end of the year. The hryvna has been trading \\nat 3.4 to the dollar in recent days but trading has been limited. \\nThere are wide expectations in Ukraine that the hryvna will fall even \\nfurther, and Ukrainians have been stocking up on food, clothing and \\nhousehold goods to save their fast-devaluing money. \\n\\nThe United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within \\nthe new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said \\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia \\nabout the dangers of an anti-Western policy. In her first comprehensive \\nreview of U.S.-Russian relations since Primakov was confirmed as prime \\nminister last month, Albright said Washington was ``deeply concerned'' \\nabout Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would \\nsoon abate. ``We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing \\nnew money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and \\nrestoring state management of parts of the economy,'' she told the \\nU.S.-Russia Business Council in Chicago. ``We can only wonder if some \\nmembers of Primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of the \\nglobal economy.'' While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when \\nhe was foreign minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key \\nissues with Washington, she had harsh words of warning for him. ``Our \\ninitial reaction to some of the direction he's going in has not been \\nparticularly positive,'' she said, adding, ``The question now is whether \\nthat cooperation can continue.'' The United States must keep up its \\naid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy \\nand student exchanges as well as arms control, Albright said. Washington \\ndoes not favor more direct aid. ``More big bailouts are not by themselves \\ngoing to restore investor confidence in Russia,'' she said. ``In the \\nlong run, the gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be \\nmet not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment.'' Albright \\nsharply criticized as self-defeating the ``many voices in Russia who \\nwant to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction with America and \\nour allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition \\nand defiance for its own stake.'' Russia could not stand alone in \\nthe world, she said, and the United States' ability ``to help Russians \\nhelp themselves will go from being merely very, very difficult to \\nbeing absolutely impossible.'' At the same time, she said, Washington \\nwould not ``assume the worst, for there are still plenty of people \\nin Russia who will fight against turning back the clock.'' And she \\nurged the world _ and American critics _ to ``be patient with the \\nworkings of the democratic process in Russia'' and ``not start each \\nday by taking a census of reformers in the Kremlin,'' a census that \\nAmerican officials themselves promoted before President Boris Yeltsin \\ndismissed the previous government. While Moscow may continue to oppose \\nany NATO use of force against Serbian forces in the southern province \\nof Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepared to act regardless. \\n\\nWall Street extended a global stock selloff Thursday with the Dow \\nindustrials tumbling more than 200 points for a second straight day. \\nThe Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 237.90 points on Wednesday, \\nfell an additional 210.09, or by 2.7 percent, to close at 7,632.53. \\nBroader market indicators also sank sharply in heavy trading. Bank \\nand technology stocks were particularly hard hit. The selling spree, \\namid worries about shrinking corporate profits and fears of new financial \\ncrises, left the Dow 18.3 percent, or more than 1,700 points, below \\nthe all-time high of 9,337.97 reached on July 17. It was getting closer \\nto the low of 7,400 that was reached during trading Sept. 1, before \\nWall Street's best-known indicator began a comeback bid that brought \\nit above 8,100 as recently as Monday. The Dow's 12.4 percent slide \\nin the third quarter, which ended Wednesday, was its worst quarterly \\nperformance in eight years. It now is 3.5 percent below where it began \\nthis year. Stock prices earlier plunged in Asia, with Tokyo shares \\nfalling 1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and shares were falling \\nsharply in Europe, where Germany's central bank left interest rates \\nunchanged. Blue chips in London sank 3.1 percent to close at new lows \\nfor the year, while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed down \\n5.5 percent and the main indicator in Paris was off 5 percent. The \\nselloff in stocks has sent a flood of money into U.S. Treasury securities, \\na traditional haven in times of uncertainty. Yields on 30-year Treasury \\nbonds fell further below 5 percent Thursday, reaching levels unseen \\nfor long-term government bonds since 1967. Traders were alarmed to \\nsee prices on the New York Stock Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on \\nWednesday, even though the Federal Reserve had lowered a key interest \\nrate one-quarter percentage point on Tuesday. Some traders were disappointed \\nthat the cut was not deeper amid fears a go-slow approach would not \\ndo enough to counter the economic crises that have swept through Asia \\nand Russia and are threatening Latin America. ``The smaller-than-expected \\nlowering of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve has a chain \\nreaction,'' said Lee Won-ho, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. \\nin Seoul, South Korea, where the main stock index fell by 1.5 percent. \\n``It is affecting Wall Street, the Japanese market, ours and others.'' \\nThe managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, \\non Thursday said the Fed made the right decision in cutting rates \\nand that global powers now must push for stronger growth to offset \\nsteep recessions in Asia and Russia. Asked why stock markets, particularly \\nin the United States, have reacted so negatively to the Fed rate cut, \\nCamdessus said he believed confidence will soon be restored, especially \\nif financial leaders show resolve in their discussions over the next \\nweek. There also are worries about where the next financial market \\ncrisis may erupt after last week's dlrs 3.6 billion private bailout \\nof Long-Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Connecticut. In addition, \\ninvestors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall Street could signal \\na possible slowdown in economic growth _ a bad omen for the many foreign \\ncompanies dependent on exports to the huge U.S. market. ``There's \\na psychological impact overall, but there's also a direct impact on \\ncompanies like Sony and TDK which derive a high percentage of their \\nearnings from overseas markets,'' said Pelham Smithers, a stock strategist \\nin Tokyo at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. A new survey in Japan \\nsaid confidence among small- and medium-sized businesses about the \\neconomy plunged to its worst level since the Bank of Japan began the \\nquarterly samplings in 1967. \\n\\nIf the Communist Party has its way _ and it has been planning for \\nmonths _ millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday \\nfor some of the biggest demonstrations in years. But now that Communists \\nor politicians with the Communist stamp of approval are running the \\ncountry and its economy the question is what the marchers will be \\ndemonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers \\nwere easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seems but a shadow of \\nhimself today, and his advisers are gone. The Communists, who have \\nundergone a sort of resurgence by playing on the discontent, are working \\nhard to cast themselves as outsiders in the government that they help \\nrun _ and to keep the focus of the protests on Wednesday on Yeltsin \\nand his policies. Even that strategy may backfire, however, because \\ndiscontent over Yeltsin does not necessarily translate into support \\nfor his predecessors. An adviser to the Communist Party leader, Gennadi \\nZyuganov, made headlines not long ago when he called the new government \\nbourgeois. The characterization was striking, because the new prime \\nminister, Yevgeny Primakov, was one of Zyuganov's top choices for \\nthe post. The deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, Yuri \\nMaslyukov, is a Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan, the \\ninfamous central-planning program that helped bring the Soviet Union \\nto ruin. ``We don't have slogans that are aimed against the government,'' \\nthe first secretary of the Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander \\nKuvayev, said in a recent interview. ``All the slogans are aimed against \\nthe president and the economic course of the country. Only the president \\ncan fully be blamed for the course that has brought the country to \\nthis situation.'' Anger over Russia's fate, and their own, is drawing \\nsome Russians back to Soviet-style slogans and old-style hostility \\ntoward capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya \\nRossiya devoted most of its front page on Thursday to what it said \\nwere the results of a contest among readers for protest slogans. The \\nentries ranged from catchy to kitschy, from, ``Legislator, official, \\nbanker _ study the Constitution; the exam is Oct. 7,'' to, `` Imperialist! \\nHelp Russia return the exported capital, and we will pay the debts \\nat once.'' Russia has seen nothing approaching this sort of economic \\nchaos and despair since 1993, when hyperinflation swept the economy. \\nThere is no real way of knowing whether the latest travails will produce \\nhuge and ugly crowds or small, peaceful ones. A deputy editor and \\npolitical analyst at a newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said the situation \\nwas not unlike that of 1993, when Yeltsin sought, and won, a popular \\nmandate in a referendum. He used it to dissolve the Communist-dominated \\nParliament and increase his own power. That led to an autumn showdown, \\nthe shelling of Parliament by tanks and the total defeat, for the \\ntime being, of Yeltsin's legislative opponents. ``You can interpret \\nthis demonstration as a Communist mandate, but I don't think they \\nwill act like Yeltsin,'' Ms. Lipman said. ``Support for the Communists \\nis at its smallest level, maybe 20 percent.'' In a survey of 1,714 \\npeople that was released last week the All-Russian Public Opinion \\nCenter said that nearly half the population supported the idea of \\ndemonstrations against Yeltsin, but that barely one-tenth were likely \\nto participate in any way. ``Nobody is interested in any sort of struggle,'' \\nYuri Levada, who heads the center, said in an interview. ``This is \\nmainly a general expression of a great wave of distrust of authorities, \\nmainly the president. He's the great scapegoat for all our sins.'' \\nThere seems to be little enthusiasm for demonstrations of any sort. \\nOnly a few thousand people turned out Sunday for the fifth anniversary \\nof the shelling of Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph over \\nthe Communists. The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent \\nRussian Unions, a leftist organization that says it is the main sponsor \\nof the protests, predict that 9 million Russians will participate \\non Wednesday. The government has vowed to keep order without resorting \\nto force. But it is concerned enough that it has summoned 11,000 police \\nofficers to patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troops to intervene if \\nviolence erupts. Protests since 1993 have generally been tepid, a \\ndeep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, more or less \\npractice runs, hinted at similarly dampened marches this year. \\n\\nUkraine's parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid \\nKuchma's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for \\nsavings lost in banks. Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised \\nversion of the decree and debate it later in the month. They must \\nconsider the decree by Oct. 10, or else it automatically takes effect \\nunder the constitution. Leftist factions, which voted against the \\nproposed legislation, said it would not fully guarantee the return \\nof savings lost during the financial instability that has recently \\nhit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated \\nmoney in a special National Bank account and repay people in case \\nthe bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent. \\nAlthough the decree provided for compensation of deposits amounting \\nonly to 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 at the current exchange rate), its authors \\nsaid it would cover more than 90 percent of Ukrainians who keep their \\nmoney in banks. The measure was meant to prevent mass withdrawals \\nof deposits that most Ukrainian banks have already experienced as \\npeople, scared by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil \\nin neighboring Russia, started to stock up on food, clothing and household \\ngoods. Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn \\nat least 10 percent of the 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they \\ndeposited in banks. \\n\\nPrime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that the economic crisis \\nwould not bring an end to the government's program of privatizing \\nstate property. ``Privatization will be accomplished for growth of \\nproduction, growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness \\nthrough renewal of major funds,'' Primakov said during a meeting of \\nWestern businessmen. ``We shall conduct privatization so that it serves \\nthe interests of the people, the state, and business,'' he said, according \\nto the ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassured the businessmen, \\nmembers of the prime minister's consultive council on foreign investment \\nin Russia, that the government had no plans to ban the circulation \\nof U.S. dollars in Russia. But, he said, the government would take \\nsteps to staunch the flow of dollars from Russia. Responding to media \\nreports of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians \\nfrom buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, Primakov said \\nthe reports ``absolutely do not correspond to reality,'' ITAR-Tass \\nquoted him as saying. He said there was no need to regulate the influx \\nof dollars into Russia, but the government should take steps to prevent \\nwhat he called ``the dollar drain.'' Russian companies stashed about \\ndlrs 2.5 billion outside the country in September alone, the Interfax \\nnews agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figures. Primakov \\nsaid foreign investors are ``the force'' that will help Russia to \\nminimize its losses from the current economic crisis. ``We are very \\nmuch interested in foreign investments, especially in ones that go \\ninto the real production sector,'' Primakov said, according to Interfax. \\n``We need a continuous dialogue with foreign investors, without whom \\nit will be difficult for us to overcome the current difficulties.'' \\nHe said Russia wanted long-term investments. ``Foreign capital has \\nbeen coming to the country via short-term operations,'' Primakov said. \\nThis, he said, ``is not to our liking or yours.'' Viktor Gerashchenko, \\nthe central bank chairman, said on Friday that the government must \\nact to stem the flow of dollars from Russia. Gerashchenko and Finance \\nMinister Mikhail Zadornov were in Washington Saturday for the annual \\nmeeting of the International Monetary Fund, where they plan to spell \\nout the measures Russia is taking to bail out its finance system. \\nRussia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion installment \\nof a loan that was approved in July, a month before the country's \\neconomy crashed and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign \\nloans. IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to \\ncome up with a sound economic program before the installment is given, \\nand have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money \\nsupply by printing rubles are not acceptable. \\n\\nRussia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the \\nnation Thursday. After two weeks of deliberations he announced that \\nhe still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis. \\n``I want to repeat once more _ there is no program,'' Prime Minister \\nYevgeny Primakov said. ``It has yet to be worked out.'' In most nations \\nsuch a statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov was seeking to \\ncalm an anxious public that was worried that the Kremlin's cure could \\nbe worse than the disease. It is not as if Russians do not have something \\nto be concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened a meeting of top \\naides to try to hammer out a strategy for overcoming the economic \\nwoes. A main item on the agenda was the plan drafted by Yuri Maslyukov, \\na Communist and the government's senior policy maker on economic issues. \\nIt did not take long for Maslyukov's plan to hit the street. A newspaper, \\nKommersant Daily, published it in full Thursday morning. Not surprisingly \\nMaslyukov's plan calls for a greater state role in the economy, including \\ncontrols on hard currency. A new State Bank for Reconstruction and \\nDevelopment would be established using the ``nationalized assets'' \\nof failed commercial banks. Wages and pensions would be paid in two \\nmonths, and the minimum wage would be indexed to inflation. There \\nwould be huge tax cuts, a combination that suggested that the government \\nwas committed to printing additional money. The exchange rate of the \\nruble would be set by the central bank, based on changes in inflation \\nand the balance of payments. Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians \\nwould be able to buy dollars at exchanges through the country. It \\nstipulates that hard currency could enter the country only with special \\nauthorization. Exporters would be required to sell most of their hard \\ncurrency reserves. That is an allusion to currency controls that sent \\nshock waves through the Russian public. Russians have come to treat \\nthe dollar as a second currency, and many people have squirreled away \\ndollars as a hedge against inflation. ``It is an obvious stupidity,'' \\nOtto Latsis, a commentator with the newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. \\n``People won't give their dollars away. They will go to the black \\nmarket if they need to.'' Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister \\nwho favors free markets, said the plan was a ``war against the dollar'' \\nand predicted that it would lead to a shortage of imports. As the \\ncriticism grew, Primakov rushed to distance himself from the talk \\nof currency controls. ``The rumors of the state's becoming a monopolist \\non the inflow of hard currency into the country is nonsense,'' he \\nsaid, asserting that the document published by Kommersant Daily was \\njust one of six possible plans. Primakov may be opposed to wildly \\nunpopular currency controls. He may be worried that the plan would \\nwould set off the panic buying of dollars, further depressing the \\nruble. Or he may simply be trying to keep his distance from Maslyukov's \\nplan while Russia tries to wrangle its next disbursement, $4.3 billion, \\nfrom the International Monetary Fund. The particulars could be modified, \\nbut many people following the maneuvering say they believe that it \\nrepresents the basic thrust of the government's thinking. Primakov \\nhas called for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money \\nsupply, two themes of Maslyukov's plan. The plan also has many similarities \\nwith the plan presented to the government by Gorbachev-era advisers. \\n``We think it is close to being a final document,'' said the United \\nFinancial Group, a Russian investment business. It is unclear how \\nlong Primakov can carry on without spelling out a detailed strategy. \\nThe ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, has argued that the IMF should \\nnot provide further aid until Primakov has taken tough measures to \\nbuild a free market. Primakov has, however, sought to turn that logic \\non its head, arguing that his government's economic strategy will \\ndepend on the fund's willingness to provide aid. His aim appears to \\nbe to pressure the fund by implying that it will be the fund's fault \\nif Russia is forced to default on its loans or take draconian measures \\nat home. Or as Primakov put it Thursday, without the fund's money, \\nRussia will have to impose ``unpopular measures.'' \\n\\nWhen the world's finance ministers and central bankers gathered last \\nyear in Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other for containing \\n_ at least for the moment _ a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. \\nIn a year's time, many predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles \\nin Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 \\n_ a rough bump in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity. \\nTalk about bad market calls. Twelve months later, as the same financial \\nmandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide through \\nendless receptions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary \\nFund and the World Bank, just about everything that could have gone \\nwrong in the world economy has: the worst downturn in Japan since \\nWorld War II, economic meltdown in Russia, a depression in Indonesia \\nthat is plunging 100 million people below the poverty line, and deep \\nfears over what happens next in Latin America. What makes this year's \\nIMF meeting most remarkable, though, is that the harshest criticisms \\nare directed at the monetary fund itself, and, by extension, at the \\nU.S. Treasury, which is viewed as the power behind the IMF. This year, \\nin place of confident predictions, there are mutual recriminations. \\nArguments are breaking out over whether the true culprits were crony \\ncapitalists and weakened leaders like Russian President Boris Yeltsin, \\nor huge investors who poured money into the world's emerging markets \\nwith reckless abandon in the mid-1990s and panicked in the past twelve \\nmonths. Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billions \\nof dollars have fled from economies on four continents _ seeking the \\nsafest havens possible, often in the United States _ and the money \\nis not returning anytime soon. And the subtext of every seminar on \\ncapital flows and every conclave of nervous ministers will be some \\npainfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? Or is the world headed \\nfor a global recession? Fifty-three years ago the IMF was created \\nafter the Bretton Woods conference which sought to stabilize the world \\neconomy and secure the peace after World War II. Now it is under attack \\nfrom all sides, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by \\nmisjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in \\nsome of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta, Indonesia, \\nto Moscow. For the first time, there are disturbing questions about \\nwhether the institution itself is still capable, financially or politically, \\nof containing the kind of economic contagion that caught the world \\nunaware. Once, the IMF's critics were largely found in Africa and \\nSouth Asia, were the fund was often viewed as arrogant; today they \\ninclude Wall Street's biggest players and top officials in the most \\npowerful economies of Asia and Europe. Only a few _ including former \\nSecretary of State George Schultz and members of Congress who are \\nincreasingly suspicious of all international institutions _ are talking \\nabout scrapping the IMF altogether. But almost everyone is talking \\nabout creating a ``new financial architecture'' that can do what the \\nold one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires before they leap \\naround the globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair \\nand other leaders, after months of silence, have edged into the debate, \\nin some cases wresting the issue for the first time from their finance \\nministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, is that \\n15 months of financial turmoil are now threatening political stability. \\nSuch concerns have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled mass \\nof worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions. The Japanese, \\nthe French, the Southeast Asians are all arriving in Washington with \\ndifferent diagnoses of what went wrong, and different solutions about \\nhow to set it right. The United States has its own set of plans, a \\nmix of suggestions to force more disclosure of financial data in countries \\naround the world and to impose more American-style financial standards \\nand regulation. Meanwhile, an ideological argument is breaking out \\nover whether the world should slow down a long march toward more free \\nand open markets _ a strategy pressed by the Clinton administration \\nfor the past six years. Others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding \\nthe hospital while the patients are still on the operating tables. \\n``Last year the standard answer that all of us were given came down \\nto this: `We have the IMF and the World Bank, and they know best,''' \\nIndonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said over breakfast in Washington \\nthe other day, reflecting on how the crisis turned 30 years of astounding \\ngrowth in his country into an overnight depression. ``Then they said \\neverything that went wrong was our fault,'' he said. ``But now, now \\nI think people know that much of the problem came from the outside, \\nand we need something better.'' And the IMF itself is beginning to \\nfight back, an awkward role for an institution dominated by Ph.D. \\neconomists who are unaccustomed to being openly challenged. ``Every \\nplace you turn you read the same story, that we came in, that we made \\nthings worse,'' said Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director \\nof the fund, who was born in Northern Rhodesia _ now Zambia _ and \\nbecame chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's economics \\ndepartment before taking a job that has now put him in the center \\nof the financial storm. ``We frequently get the blame, some of it \\nwell-deserved,'' he said. ``But it is politically convenient for governments \\naround the world to cry, `The IMF made us do it,' and pin their mistakes \\non us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd \\nlike to be effective.'' MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS \\nOn a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top official, \\nslipped into Jakarta to the private residence of President Suharto \\nand sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off, line by line, the \\nhuge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in return for tens \\nof billions of dollars in emergency aid. Two previous deals had collapsed \\nwhen Suharto ignored the fund's conditions, so Camdessus insisted \\nthat he strike a deal directly with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving \\nleader. It was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power \\npolitics: Suharto rose as a general in central Java, and Camdessus \\nhad detonated mines in Algeria for the French army before entering \\nthe French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central \\nbank. ``It was all there,'' a senior IMF official recalled. ``He was \\ntold he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove \\nmonopoly, all the distribution monopolies.'' At one point, Camdessus \\nlooked at the impassive Suharto and said, ``You see what this means \\nfor your family,'' a reference to their vast investments in the country's \\nkey industries. ``He said, `I called in my children, and they all \\nunderstand.''' But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to \\nsymbolize the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and \\nreckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical \\nreform, and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social \\ncosts of its actions. Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement. \\nIt was, one of his former Cabinet members said, ``a delaying move \\nthat was obvious to everyone except Camdessus.'' Perhaps one reason \\nwhy the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is \\nalmost entirely composed of Ph.D. economists. There are few officials \\nwith deep experience in international politics, much less the complexities \\nof Javanese culture that were at work in Indonesia. Historically, \\nexperts in politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations, \\ndevelopment experts to the World Bank, and economists to the IMF _ \\ncreating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one. As a result, the \\nfund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if \\nits demands were met and all Indonesia's state monopolies were quickly \\ndissolved. While that system lined the pockets of the Suhartos and \\ntheir friends, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staples \\nto a country that stretches for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands. \\nTo help balance the budget, the fund demanded a quick end to expensive \\nsubsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low. \\nBut that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked \\nthe crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots \\nthat continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians lose their jobs. \\nThe IMF _ unintentionally, its officials insist _ also sped Suharto's \\nresignation, insisting on the elimination of ``crony capitalism,'' \\ncode words for removing the Suharto family from the center of the \\neconomy. Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's salvation, if \\nthe new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic Chinese \\nminority _ whose money is desperately needed to save the country's \\nfast-shrinking economy. ``It is worth noting,'' Fischer said this \\nweek, ``that our programs in Asia _ in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand \\n_ only took hold after there was a change in government.'' Nonetheless, \\nthe Indonesia experience has revived the argument that the IMF is \\nso focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on preventing capital \\nflight and freeing up markets, that it is blind to the social costs \\nof its actions. Among the toughest critics has been its sister institution, \\nthe World Bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty. ``You've \\nseen the tension almost every day,'' one senior World Bank official \\nsaid recently. The bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent \\nmonths to differentiate its role from that of the fund, and to announce \\na tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic \\nchaos. Even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined the argument, \\nwarning in a speech at Harvard recently that ``if globalization is \\nto succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must deliver \\nrights no less than riches. It must be harnessed to the cause not \\nof capital alone, but of development and prosperity for the poorest \\nof the world.'' IMF officials say they are changing strategies when \\nthey see they are exacting too great a social cost. ``It's a very \\ndifficult formula to get exactly right,'' Fischer said in August, \\nas Russia was teetering and the IMF was sending in $4.8 billion in \\naid that was rapidly wasted. ``You need enough discipline to send \\nthe right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing. \\nBut you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than \\nthey otherwise would.'' In recent months, he noted, the IMF has allowed \\nmore spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods \\nin Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere. ``There is a new flexibility at \\nthe IMF'' a senior Indonesian official concluded recently. ``It is \\na lot better.'' A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration \\nadmits that the IMF has many failings, many of them on display this \\nyear. But it insists that the world has gone through global financial \\ncrises without an IMF once before in this century _ and the result \\nwas the 1930s. ``I have no doubt the situation over the past year \\nwould have been much worse _ with greater devaluations, more defaults, \\nmore contagion, and greater trade dislocations _ without the program \\nagreed with the IMF and the finance it has provided,'' Deputy Treasury \\nSecretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans \\nand some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though the Senate has overwhelmingly \\napproved an $18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight \\nnew crises, the House defeated that measure two weeks ago. The fund's \\nlast hope of getting the money, which will free up nearly $100 billion \\nin contributions from other nations waiting for the United States \\nto act, will come when the House and Senate try to resolve their budget \\ndifferences in a conference committee in the next 10 days. A rejection, \\nTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send a message around \\nthe world that the United States is turning its back on the one institution \\ncharged with restoring economic stability. Everywhere else in the \\nworld, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one of the \\nbiggest problems with the IMF is that, contrary to the view of Congress, \\nit acts as the U.S. Treasury's lap dog. Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, \\nand the response is the same: The IMF never ventures far without looking \\nback for the approving nod of its master. When the United States weighs \\nin, however, is when the IMF is called on to rescue a country in deep \\ntrouble. Only then does the IMF _ and the U.S. Treasury _ have the \\nleverage to extract commitments in return for billions in aid. In \\ntheory, the U.S. influence is limited: It has an 18.5 percent vote \\nin the fund. Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent \\neach. But in practice the United States usually gets its way, exercising \\nits influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Fischer \\nand Summers. The two met when Fischer was on the MIT faculty and Summers \\nwas a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a \\ncolleague at MIT. Each served as chief economist of the World Bank. \\nIt was Summers who was instrumental in placing Fischer in the fund's \\nno. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly. ``It's usually a warm \\nrelationship,'' Fischer said this summer. ``Remember, this is a job \\nwhere you cannot turn to outsiders for advice _ you can't call the \\nchief economist at a Wall Street firm, or even many of your academic \\nfriends, because so many of the issues are confidential.'' The Treasury's \\nrelations with Camdessus are often more strained as he plays the role \\nof world diplomat, traveling the globe and trying to coax along political \\nleaders. The tensions were obvious from the start of the Asia crisis. \\nThe fund made little secret of its displeasure that the United States \\nwas not offering direct aid to Thailand, a major U.S. ally, as a sign \\nof support and confidence. Mindful of the backlash in Congress when \\nMexico was bailed out with U.S. money, that was the last thing the \\nTreasury planned to do. Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not \\nforcing the Thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough \\nor disclose their true financial picture. Within the U.S. government \\nthere was other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt \\nthe United States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when \\nthe Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their \\nown budgets. There were other conflicts. When Japan used the last \\nIMF meeting to propose setting up a $100 billion ``Asia Fund'' _ one \\nthat would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid \\nunder much more relaxed conditions than the IMF does. Rubin called \\nup Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese \\nproposal would undercut the IMF's authority. ``We've just had a dispute \\nwith Michel,'' Rubin reported to his aides as he returned to his orange \\njuice and croissant. One of them shot back: ``And it's only 8 a.m.'' \\nCamdessus backed down at Rubin's insistence and walked away from money \\nthat Asia could have used. Japan says it will be back with a similar \\nproposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund. Camdessus \\nhas also rankled U.S. officials with statements that amounted to cheerleading \\nto reassure the markets _ sometimes in the face of the facts. In June, \\nwith Russia on its way to collapse, Camdessus declared that ``contrary \\nto what markets and commentators are imagining'' about the slow collapse \\nof Russia's economy, ``this is not a crisis. This is not a major development.'' \\nThe bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of how \\nWashington muscles into the IMF's turf as soon as major U.S. strategic \\ninterests are involved. Last Christmas, as South Korea slipped within \\ndays of running out of hard currency to pay its debts in December, \\nit sent a secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. \\n``I didn't bother going to the IMF,'' Kim recalled recently. ``I called \\nSummers' office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington \\nand went directly there. I knew that was how this would get done.'' \\nWithin days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most experienced \\nveteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post as undersecretary \\nfor international affairs this month, to shadow the IMF staff's negotiations \\nwith the government in Seoul. Fischer was displeased. ``To make a \\nnegotiation effective, it has to be clear who has the authority to \\ndo the negotiating,'' he said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern was repeated \\nthis summer, when the United States raced to put together a $17 billion \\npackage for Russia. The IMF's staff in Moscow declared that Russia \\nneeded no money at all _ it just needed to enact policies that would \\nrestore confidence in investors. The Americans and Germans came to \\na different conclusion. Soon after, U.S. officials gathered in the \\nWhite House situation room to consider what might happen to Russia \\nif the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push \\nthe IMF to come up with emergency money. So the fund began assembling \\na last-ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform \\nplans for seven years. Camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning \\nwhether the IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia. ``We had \\nto pull Michel along,'' a senior Treasury official recalled. As it \\nturned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while the approach championed \\nby Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment \\nof that payment _ $4.8 billion _ was wasted, propping up the currency \\nlong enough, in the words of one IMF official, ``to let the oligarchs \\nget their money out of the country.'' Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments, \\nlet the ruble devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and \\nfired virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a \\ncollapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its \\naid program. Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there are recriminations \\nover ``who lost Russia.'' Publicly, Fischer argues that ``there are \\nno apologies owed for what we attempted in Russia.'' But some IMF \\nofficials complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod \\nover them, striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian \\nparliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitments. \\nSummers responds that the United States ``took a calculated risk'' \\nbecause ``it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not succeed.'' \\nThe Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic contagion, \\nwith investors fleeing Latin America, and triggering huge losses in \\nhedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich, Conn., investment \\nfirm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street powerhouses whose money \\nit had invested. ``Russia was a turning point,'' said Robert Hormats, \\nthe vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``It made the world \\nrealize that some countries can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury \\nintercede. And that changed the perception of risk.'' Now, as the \\ncountries meet to face a future that the IMF has warned could be very \\nbleak, they need to reverse those perceptions, or watch countries \\nslowly starve for lack of capital. The emerging markets are calling \\nfor controls on short term investments. The French want a stronger \\nIMF. The Americans say the answer is more disclosure, so that investors \\nare better warned, and tougher regulation. ``These are usually nice, \\nquiet meetings; everyone very polite,'' a top U.S. official said earlier \\nthis week. ``Not this year.'' \\n\\nPresident Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit \\nRussians from buying foreign currencies, believing the move would \\nbe like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman \\nsaid Friday. ``The president clearly understands that such a ban would \\nbe a clear violation of our rights ... that would mean a return to \\nthe Iron Curtain in everyday life,'' said presidential spokesman Dmitry \\nYakushin. The remarks came after media reports of a government economic \\nplan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars \\nand other foreign currencies, and institute other strict economic \\ncontrols, rolling back seven years of reforms. Though government officials \\nsay such a plan is only one of six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny \\nPrimakov warned Thursday that he might be forced to take ``unpopular'' \\nmeasures to rescue the Russian economy if it does not receive the \\nnext installment in a dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the International \\nMonetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance \\nMinister Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations \\nwith the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials \\nhave said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound \\neconomic program before the loan is given, and have made it clear \\nthat currency controls and boosting the money supply by printing rubles \\nare not acceptable. But Primakov said that the country's plan would \\nbe dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around. No short-term \\neconomic plan will be known for another three weeks, long after the \\nIMF is set to make its decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister \\nVadim Gustov. A draft version of the government's fourth-quarter budget \\nwould rely heavily on the IMF loan, the Kommersant newspaper said. \\nWithout the loan, the government would have to engage in major deficit \\nspending. Calls for Soviet-style controls _ part of the plan drafted \\nby First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked to the press \\n_ have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet. The plan drew \\nheavy criticism from Zadornov, and Gerashchenko called the idea of \\nbanning foreign currency sales ``a mad idea.'' Meanwhile, Russia's \\nstock market dropped by 5 percent to 38.8 Friday, but trading was \\nso light the downward move meant little. The stock market has continued \\nto fall since the crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection was down \\nin September, the result of the collapse in Russia's banking system, \\nsaid Alexander Pochinok, head of the government's finance and credit \\ndepartment. Revenues totaled 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), \\n700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less than expected. The government \\nwants to reverse this trend by raising taxes for oil and gas companies, \\nbut the idea is expected to meet sharp resistance in the lower house \\nof Russia's parliament, which wants to cut tax rates, Pochinok said. \\n\\nIn a season of crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, \\nfailing cropsand rotating governments, maybe it is not the ultimate \\ninsult. But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regards \\na well-written letter as a labor of love, is buckling a little this \\nweek, because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk. \\nThe Post Office is broke. In 60 of the country's 89 statelike regions, \\nmore than 1,000 mail cars have been sidetracked, many stuffed with \\nup to 18 tons of letters, newspapers and parcels. The state Railway \\nMinistry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good \\non some 210 million rubles in old bills _ about $13 million in today's \\ndollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, which \\namounts to one of every four or five letters, was also suspended at \\none of Moscow's major airports until this week, when the Post Office \\ncoughed up 5 million rubles for old bills. A second airport is still \\ndemanding 3 million rubles for past-due debts. So much mail is backed \\nup that post offices in Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting \\nout-of-town mail, except for areas that can be easily reached by truck. \\nDelivery schedules have fallen weeks, and perhaps months, behind. \\n``The situation is really extraordinary,'' said Vladimir Sherekhov, \\nthe deputy chief of mail service administration in the government's \\nCommunications Committee. ``We've never had anything like this before.'' \\nMaybe the Post Office has been lucky. Extraordinary is the rule elsewhere \\nin Russia. Until Friday, the lower house of Parliament was preparing \\nto sue the government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper \\nand copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown offices. \\nIt turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds by cutting \\nshort their recess and returning to address the nation's economic \\ncrisis. Earlier in the week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping \\nroutes may close next month because half the nation's icebreakers \\nare in disrepair and there is no money to fix them. The oldest of \\nthe ships is so ancient that its nickname is Granny. Such anecdotal \\nevidence that Russia is losing its wheels, like one of its old, ill-maintained \\nVolga sedans, is everywhere. But oddly, real signs of public distress \\nare not particularly common, perhaps because the system rarely seems \\nto shed a part as big as a postal system. If the U.S. Postal Service \\nis increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills, the \\nRussian Post Office still holds a special place in the national conversation. \\nRussians still write letters to each other, frequently and fervently, \\nand many in remote regions get their news through the mail. Millions \\nuse the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives \\nand friends in faraway areas, an especially vital service in winter. \\nAnd in the last few years, the Post Office has become a vehicle for \\na growing mail-order trade in books, clothes and other catalog items \\nnot readily available outside big cities. Exactly why all this has \\nrumbled to a halt is in some dispute. What is clear is that the Post \\nOffice and the Railway Ministry both suffer from what ails every Russian \\nventure, private and public alike: Nobody pays his bills. The state \\nRailway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers \\nwho believe the railroads are honor-bound to carry freight whether \\nthey are paid or not. The government has specified nearly 40 categories \\nof freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing. Among \\nthe biggest deadbeats are the ``power ministries'' _ the military \\nand interior departments _ which did not pay during Soviet times and \\nfeel little need to pay now. ``It's a psychology formed during the \\nsocialist period,'' said Tatiana Pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman \\nfor the ministry, ``and the same situation exists with the Post Office. \\nWe've been in dispute for a very long time. Always we try to understand \\ntheir differences. But we can't carry cargo for free.'' No kidding, \\nsays the Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million rubles by government \\nagencies, and is barred from raising rates even though freight costs \\nare outstripping revenues. Moreover, the Post Office is also required \\nby the government to carry some forms of mail, such as pension checks, \\nat reduced rates. Officials at the state Communications Department \\nsay they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions: \\na struggle to dominate the thriving mail-order business. ``Here's \\ncompetition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels, \\nand I think decisions made by the railroads are mainly explained by \\nthis competition,'' Sherekhov said. ``They blame us for carrying some \\ncommercial cargoes instead of mail.'' The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, \\nMs. Pashkova, said such ``commercial cargoes'' are indeed a problem, \\nbut only because the railroads know that the Post Office has already \\ngotten cash to transport the packages. The railroads are still waiting \\nfor their share of that money, she said. In the meantime, the situation \\nhas come to a boil. In late September the railroads cut mail service \\nin and out of Moscow, effectively decapitating the postal system and \\nforcing officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and \\nout of the city. Hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged \\nsome local yards to the point where moving cars into position for \\nunloading has become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars were \\nawaiting service at one yard. And customers are getting angry. ``We've \\ngotten all kinds of complaints,'' said Viktor Salikov, a deputy in \\nthe Communications Department's mail shipping center. ``People are \\neven coming to us, searching for mail that was sent weeks ago.'' \\n\", \"\\nMicrosoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two \\nbusiness school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in \\nthe antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week. But judging from \\nan advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 states \\nthat are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments \\nin the book as well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends that \\nits industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer \\nbrowser are a single integrated product. In its suit, the government \\nasserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled \\ntogether to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications \\nCorp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World \\nWide Web. In ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and \\nIts Battle with Microsoft,'' the authors, Michael A. Cusumano of the \\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management \\nand David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft \\nexecutive as saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's \\nbrowser was it integrated with Windows. Microsoft hurried its first \\nbrowser offerings into the market, the book says, in its race to catch \\nup with Netscape, then took a more ambitious approach with Internet \\nExplorer 3.0, which was introduced in August 1996. In that version \\nit changed its software design to use programming modules, or components, \\nthat could be put together and rearragned like building blocks. In \\nthe book, Ben Slivka, a Microsoft general manager, is quoted as saying, \\n``IE 3.0 was the key thing because we did the componentized browser,'' \\nHe added, ``We really made Internet Explorer part of the Windows platform.'' \\nThe timing could be legally significant because in its suit the government \\ncites as evidence requests before August 1996 by personal computer \\nmakers that wanted to load Netscape's browser on their machines instead \\nof Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied the requests, insisting its \\nbrowers and Windows were a single, integrated product. Microsoft's \\nlegal team obtained an early manuscript of the new book last month, \\nby issuing a subpoena to a Netscape executive who was given a confidential \\ncopy by the authors to review. Microsoft has also sought the transcripts \\nof 44 current and former Netscape employees interviewed by the authors. \\nA federal judge in Boston last week denied Microsoft access to that \\nresearch materials, but the company may appeal the ruling. The new \\nbook, published by the Free Press imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster, \\nis being hurried into print so it can be shipped within days of the \\nstart of the Microsoft trial on Oct. 19. But already, a few quotes \\nfrom Netscape executives have leaked out. The authors decided to send \\nthe complete manuscript to The New York Times and three other news \\norganizations Monday, so that the material could be read in context. \\nMicrosoft intends to use material from the book as evidence that Netscape's \\ntroubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather than from any \\nalleged predatory practices by Microsoft. The book does detail where \\nNetscape stumbled, shifting its strategy too often and running into \\nobstacles in its software development efforts. In private antitrust \\nsuits, the argument that the competitor was his own worst enemy is \\nan established defense. But legal experts say that defense may well \\nbe far less effective in a federal case in which the government is \\nseeking court-mandated changes in Microsoft's business practices rather \\nthan the monetary damages that are the goal of plaintiffs in private \\ncases. ``It seems to me that this debate over Netscape's mistakes \\nis a total sideshow,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official \\nin the Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now at the \\nBrookings Institution. ``But Microsoft has a big legal team, and it \\nseems they are working on every defense they can find.'' The book \\nquotes a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, as saying the company \\nbungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from \\nAmerica Online Inc. But that was a second-chance to do a deal with \\nAmerica Online, the leading online service. The government's case \\nfocuses on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose \\nInternet Explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft \\nagreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main \\nWindows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing. For a \\nbook entitled ``Competing on Internet Time,'' it is intriguing that \\none of its central themes is that Netcape got too wedded to the notion \\nthat the Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, \\nby contrast, stuck to its three-year planning horizon that enabled \\nthe company, the authors write, to ``mesh its short-run tactical plans \\nwith a broader strategic view of how to win the war.'' The book quotes \\nSteve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, as saying, ``The fact of the \\nmatter is that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three \\nmonths. The organization also can't. You can ship products quickly. \\nBut you can't say, `Oh, we have a radically new strategy' every three \\nmonths.'' \\n\\nFollowing is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, \\nas passed by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which federal \\nantitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times \\n_ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison \\nterms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted \\nof violating it. In the case of Microsoft, the government has invoked \\nthe Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's \\nbusiness practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties. \\nAn Act to Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and \\nMonopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of \\ntrust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce \\namong the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared \\nto be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage \\nin any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a \\nmisdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine \\nnot exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding \\none year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. \\nSection 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, \\nor combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize \\nany part of the trade of commerce among the several States, or with \\nforeign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on \\nconviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand \\ndollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said \\npunishments, in the discretion of the court. \\n\\nIn the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon \\nValley. The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity \\nfor entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on the \\npersonal computer software business. Leading the challenge was Netscape \\nCommunications Corp., whose software for browsing the World Wide Web \\nhad ignited the Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke \\nboldly of attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery from the \\nmovie ``Star Wars,'' referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and \\nNetscape as the leader of a rebel alliance. Microsoft answered with \\na vengeance. It dispatched hundreds of programmers to work on a competing \\nbrowser and poured many millions of dollars into marketing it. It \\nprodded computer makers and others to distribute its browser, folded \\nthe browser into its industry-dominant Windows operating system and \\ngave the browser away free _ a campaign intended to ``cut off their \\nair supply,'' as a senior Microsoft executive described it. But not \\nonly competitors like Netscape have encountered Microsoft's force. \\nMicrosoft's partners, its corporate customers and professional investors \\nwho finance new ventures have all collided with it. A close look at \\nMicrosoft's no-holds-barred push into the Internet software business \\noffers a window into the ways the company uses its market muscle to \\ninfluence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry. \\nSome of the cases recounted here figure prominently in the suit brought \\nby the Justice Department and 20 states, scheduled to go to trial \\nthis month, charging that Microsoft at times went too far _ and violated \\nantitrust laws. Regardless of the legal outcome, previously unreported \\ndetails about incidents in the suit and the other examples provide \\na more complete picture of Microsoft in action. _ When Compaq Computer \\nCorp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's \\non its personal computers, Microsoft threatened to stop selling its \\nWindows operating system to Compaq. The company quickly changed its \\nmind. _ After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft with its early \\nbrowser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away its \\nbrowser free. The timing came as a rude surprise to its partner Spyglass. \\nThe company lost most of its revenues almost overnight, as the technology, \\nwhich it had also been licensing to companies besides Microsoft, suddenly \\nbecame available free. _ When America Online Inc., which competes \\nfiercely with Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions, \\nwent shopping for browser technology, Microsoft made an offer that \\nwas too good to pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser \\nas the main one for its millions of subscribers, Microsoft would give \\nAmerica Online prime placement on the desktop screen of all personal \\ncomputers using Windows. _ When Intel Corp. began developing its own \\nInternet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, the leading maker \\nof the microprocessors that serve as the electronic brains on most \\npersonal computers running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided \\nthat its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with Microsoft took priority. \\n_ Microsoft's reach in computing has become so pervasive that nearly \\nevery year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately \\nwith a team of top Microsoft executives to learn about the company's \\nplans. The goal, one venture investor observed, was to ``stay out \\nof the way of the steamroller.'' Microsoft adamantly denies that it \\nhas broken any laws in these or similar situations. The company plays \\nthe game of business hard, and its executives acknowledge that without \\napology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer and partners may be \\nirritated occasionally. But the company insists its actions are guided \\nby its main corporate goal of bringing new technology inexpensively \\nand conveniently to the millions of people who use its software. Most \\npeople in the computer industry say that living in Microsoft's world \\nmeans routinely making accommodations to it. Microsoft's power emanates \\nfrom its near-monopoly on the market for personal computer operating \\nsystems, the master control programs that run computers. ``Because \\nit owns the operating system, Microsoft is the essential utility of \\nthe information age,'' said James Moore, president of Geopartners \\nResearch Inc., a technology consulting firm. ``It acts as a kind of \\ngatekeeper to the pipeline of computing innovation, sitting there \\nand deciding whether to help some innovation or slow it down.'' For \\nmonths, Microsoft and Netscape had talked on and off, circling each \\nother warily. But the event that would define them as unflinching \\nrivals was a meeting on June 21, 1995, in a second-floor conference \\nroom at Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, \\naccording to the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, \\nwas the high-tech equivalent of the storied gatherings in smoke-filled \\nrailroad cars that inspired passage of the nation's antitrust laws \\na century ago. On that day, they say, Microsoft made Netscape an illegal \\noffer to divvy up the market for Internet browsing software, a collusion \\npact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft replies that the prosecutors \\nare misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and \\nthat the company has never tried to divide the browser market. Bill \\nGates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, did not attend \\nthe Mountain View gathering, but he consulted by telephone with the \\nMicrosoft team. Two people who did attend that June meeting have been \\nnamed as witnesses in the trial scheduled to begin next week: Netscape \\npresident James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager \\nof new technology. In the trial, the government will contend that \\nMicrosoft presented Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, according \\nto people who have been questioned in the federal investigation. Relying \\nheavily on notes taken in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president \\nMarc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale, prosecutors are \\nexpected to assert that the Microsoft proposal had several elements, \\nboth incentives and requirements. Microsoft, according to the people \\nquestioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15 \\nto 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune \\nMicrosoft's operating systems so that Netscape's software would run \\nbetter on Windows. In return, the people say, Netscape would give \\nMicrosoft a seat on its board, license its technology to Microsoft, \\ngive Microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts \\nand not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating \\nsystem, Windows 95, which was shipped two months after the June 1995 \\nmeeting. And Microsoft, the people added, did what it has always denied \\nit does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business \\nnegotiations, by offering Netscape preferential access to the Windows \\n``application program interfaces,'' or APIs, the links that enable \\nother companies' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating \\nsystem. By turning down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have \\nthat preferred access to Microsoft technology _ a threat that Microsoft \\nfiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, \\ntold a colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 was \\n``the damnedest meeting I've ever attended in 35 years in business.'' \\nHad Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's \\nmoney and its endorsement. Netscape would have also been free to sell \\nits browser for use in earlier versions of Windows and for use on \\nother operating systems like Apple's Macintosh and Unix, a powerful \\nsystem used mainly in corporations and research labs. ``But if we \\nhad licensed our technology to Microsoft and stepped aside, the best \\nwe could have hoped for was becoming a company with sales of $100 \\nmillion or so and hoping to be bought out by Microsoft,'' said Clark, \\na former computer scientist at Stanford University who founded Silicon \\nGraphics Inc., a computer graphics pioneer, before starting Netscape. \\n``We didn't start Netscape for that.'' For any company, a meeting \\nwith Microsoft is often a charged affair. Every computing device from \\nkeyboards to disk drives, and every software program from games to \\nbrowsers, must mesh smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system. \\nThis is necessary to make computers reliable and easier to use, but \\nit also gives Microsoft its role as the industry's gatekeeper. And \\nsince Microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond \\nthe operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy position \\nof requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against \\nit. And in the software industry, where every program is rendered \\nin the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition \\nand cooperation are often blurred. The talk about that line at the \\nMicrosoft-Netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating \\nsystem _ the ``platform,'' in computer terms _ and the application \\nprograms, sometimes called ``solutions,'' that run on top of the operating \\nsystem. The government suit states that in sworn testimony, Chris \\nJones, a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting, ``admitted that \\nMicrosoft `absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete.'' \\nMicrosoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, as evidence mainly \\nof the company's clarifying its position. If Netscape stayed on the \\napplications or solutions side of the operating system, the two companies \\ncould be partners, Microsoft said. But if Netscape tried to become \\na player in the platform space, they would compete. Microsoft released \\nportions of the Jones deposition in September as evidence that the \\ngovernment had quoted the Microsoft manager out of context. Q. Do \\nyou recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of \\nMicrosoft who was participating to be able to persuade or influence \\nNetscape not to compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade in the \\nsense of force or persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have \\na great business relationship together. Later in the deposition, a \\nJustice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any of the Microsoft \\nexecutives intended to suggest that ``there would be any consequences \\nto Netscape or its business if Netscape chose to go in the platform \\ndirection you've described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction.'' \\nJones replied: ``The conversation was something like the following: \\n`We're in the platform business. We're going to invest heavily in \\nthis part of the platform because we feel it's critical to our technologies. \\nThat's a done deal.' And we're asking them: `What is your business? \\nIs your business platforms or solutions? If it's platforms, we're \\nin the platforms business. We're competing.''' Microsoft portrays \\nsuch comments as innocuous statements of fact. But to Netscape, the \\nsame remarks could be taken as a warning, if not a threat. This is \\nbecause Internet browsing software had the potential to become an \\nalternative platform to the Windows operating system. The browser, \\nsitting on top of the operating system, could supplant Windows as \\nthe main desktop screen on users' machines and the main layer of programming \\nfor starting other software applications. In addition, Netscape's \\nbrowser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running \\nJava, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems \\nInc., a Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform \\ncould replace Microsoft's APIs as the essential utility of computing. \\nIndeed, Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape's ambition to \\nrelegate Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumbing underneath \\nthe browser. By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape \\nas a serious potential challenger to Windows, the corporate crown \\njewel. On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, ``The Internet Tidal \\nWave,'' Gates wrote: ``A new competitor `born' on the Internet is \\nNetscape. Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share, allowing \\nthem to determine which network extensions will catch on.'' Netscape's \\nstrategy, Gates wrote, was to ``move the key API'' into the browser \\n``to commoditize the underlying operating system.'' THE BROADER INQUIRY: \\nGOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and the states \\nhave recently broadened their allegations against Microsoft by adding \\nevidence that it tried to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other \\ncompanies to squelch competition. They say that like the Netscape \\nmeeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by Microsoft, \\nwhich has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitors \\nand partners. One episode that fits the pattern, the prosecutors contend, \\nwas an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development \\nof multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with \\nNetscape. Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips \\nthat act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run \\nthe Windows operating system. Indeed, the fortunes of Intel and Microsoft \\nare so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred \\nto as a single, powerful entity, ``Wintel.'' But Intel also employs \\nhundreds of software engineers, mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs \\nin Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft are partners, they \\nhave also had their conflicts, typically over the direction and pace \\nat which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal \\ncomputer industry, which they dominate together. Federal and state \\ninvestigators have focused on Microsoft's strong reaction to work \\nbeing done by Intel's software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in \\nno uncertain terms during a meeting at Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., \\nheadquarters on Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session was attended \\nby several executives from Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and \\nIntel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated that Gates \\nmade ``vague threats'' about supporting Intel's competitors and that \\nhe was ``livid'' about Intel's ``investments in the Internet and wanted \\nthem stopped.'' Later, Intel did pull back from its multimedia and \\nInternet software development. Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president \\nwho attended the August 1995 meeting, is scheduled to appear as a \\nwitness for the government. Microsoft replies that the government's \\naccounts of meetings like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful \\ndistortions, created by using a biased selection of documents and \\nwitnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter \\nfailure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely \\nmeets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will \\nwork well with Windows. Sometimes the talks, Microsoft says, go on \\nto include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology \\nor a Microsoft investment, as the company discussed with Netscape. \\nIn the trial, Microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser \\nmarket was the result of its own business acumen and Netscape's missteps. \\nTo document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued a subpoena last month \\nand obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, ``Competing \\non Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft,'' \\nwhich is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape \\nexecutives. The book does chronicle the mistakes made by Netscape. \\nBut its authors, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of \\nTechnology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard \\nBusiness School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless. ``Microsoft's \\ntake-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but inviting retaliation \\nfrom competitors, the government and even customers,'' Yoffie said. \\nEmphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added, \\n``I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did \\nwithout crossing the line as much as it did.'' THE SPYGLASS LINK: \\nREWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 \\nMicrosoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the \\ncompany's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. The subject was the Internet \\nand how it might revolutionize the computer software business. Few \\nconcrete plans were made that day, but Microsoft executives insist \\nthat a direction was set. ``Our vision from the outset was to unite \\nthe two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet,'' said Steven \\nSinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting. Yet Microsoft \\nbadly trailed Netscape in the browser field. To hasten its entry, \\nMicrosoft licensed its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. \\nof Naperville, Ill. The first meeting between the two companies was \\ninitiated by Spyglass in April 1994. At the time, it was a tiny company \\nand eager to do a deal with Microsoft. Spyglass was selected as the \\ncommercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National \\nCenter for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois. In the summer \\nof 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, met with Clark of \\nNetscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. The two men talked \\nin the United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved for business-class \\npassengers, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, ``We're going \\nto take Microsoft head-on.'' At the time, Colbeth recalled thinking \\nto himself, ``Great, now Microsoft will really want to license from \\nme.'' Today, he noted: ``Remember, we were a company with a couple \\ndozen people and almost no money in the bank. Netscape had Jim Clark, \\nwith his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing \\nfrom Silicon Valley. Netscape had a very different agenda.'' By July \\n1994, Microsoft had become quite interested in the Spyglass technology, \\nColbeth says, and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement \\nthe following December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told him \\nthat it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating \\nsystem, but its timing was accelerated by Netscape's rapid rise. ``Microsoft \\nwas initially hoping to charge for the browser,'' Colbeth said. But \\non Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply \\nintegrate its browser into Windows but would give it away. The announcement \\ncaught the industry, even Colbeth, by surprise. At the time, Spyglass \\nhad licensed its technology to 82 other companies, including IBM and \\nDigital Equipment, for use in their software products _ a licensing \\nrevenue stream of about $20 million a year. As a result of Microsoft's \\nmove, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year, as smaller \\nInternet software companies went out of business and big customers \\nshifted to Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed its payroll \\nand scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace \\nits lost sales, which it succeeded in doing eventually. ``Whenever \\nyou license technology to Microsoft, you have to understand it can \\nsomeday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put \\nyou out of that business,'' Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY \\nSEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market \\ncontinued to rise, while Microsoft made little headway, even though \\nits browser was free. Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed \\nthat Netscape's browser was the clear technical leader. In April 1996, \\nNetscape's Navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the \\nWeb, compared with 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, \\naccording to Zona Research. So the biggest personal computer maker, \\nCompaq, thought it made sense to give customers Netscape's browser \\ninstead of Microsoft's. But Microsoft would not stand for that _ and \\nCompaq had no choice but to give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted not \\nonly to load the more popular Netscape browser on its machines but \\nalso to remove the icon for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was \\ndelivered to the computer maker with Windows 95. Microsoft informed \\nCompaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, the computer maker would \\nlose its license for Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director \\nof software procurement, in testimony to federal investigators. The \\nultimatum from Microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed, \\n``Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement.'' Faced with being \\ndenied the essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course \\nand kept the Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts that Windows \\nand Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone \\ndefines what is in the product. Nothing in its contracts, Microsoft \\nadds, prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies. \\nWhile the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an unnecessarily \\nhardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer, \\nMicrosoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that ``to take \\none letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray Microsoft \\nas an arrogant company is unfair.'' Noting that a Compaq executive \\nis a witness for Microsoft, Herbold said, ``We are totally dependent \\non tremendous relationships with key companies like Compaq.'' At Netscape, \\nhowever, the Compaq episode was a watershed. ``That was the singular \\nact that got me going to the Justice Department,'' Barksdale recalled. \\nBarksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq to \\nbuy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product, \\nthe Windows operating system, as ``an illegal act and absolute proof \\nthat Microsoft was a monopolist.'' After investigating the incident, \\nthe Justice Department and the states agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft \\nwas illegally tying the sale of one product to another. Microsoft \\nreplies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating \\nsystem. And from the outset, Microsoft says, it intended that Windows \\nand its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, \\nas they are now in Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no \\nproduct-tying violation of antitrust laws. In a separate case, a federal \\nappeals court sided with Microsoft, upholding the principle that the \\ncompany could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and \\ndeclare it a single product. But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted \\nto offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most \\nindustry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different \\nsoftware programs. ``It took a long time for the integration strategy \\nto play out,'' said a former senior Microsoft researcher. ``Back then, \\nintegration was basically bolting a browser onto Windows.'' THE `BALANCING \\nACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen \\nCase refers to dealing with Microsoft as ``a delicate balancing act.'' \\nThat balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of \\n1996, when Microsoft used the lure of giving America Online a featured \\nplace on the Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip. To gain \\naccess to computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed \\nto make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for its online \\nsubscribers, who now number more than 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, \\nas Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows 95, the most significant \\nimprovement ever in its operating system, Case was knocking on the \\ndoor of the Justice Department. His complaint was that Microsoft was \\ngoing to place its new online service, Microsoft Network, a direct \\ncompetitor to America Online, prominently on the desktop screen of \\nWindows 95, which was introduced in August. This bundling tactic of \\nusing the industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network, \\nor MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young \\nbut fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened \\nand investigated. But ultimately, the government decided against taking \\nany action. At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft \\nwas both feared and loathed at the time. America Online had a designated \\n``Microsoft watcher,'' a young M.B.A. who tracked its adversary's \\nevery move. Above the desk in his small, windowless office was a picture \\nof Gates. Beneath the picture, in large block letters, were the words \\n``THE ENEMY.'' Though America Online was the clear leader in the online \\nservices business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault \\nby a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft. When he had visited \\nthe Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, Case recalled, \\nGates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's options by saying he could \\nbuy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the online business \\non his own and ``bury you.'' A threat or merely a statement of the \\nfacts? ``A bit of both,'' Case said recently. ``But he was mainly \\narticulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood.'' \\nYet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason to \\ncooperate. With the exploding popularity of the Internet's World Wide \\nWeb, the conventional online companies, like America Online and Compuserve, \\nhad to provide their customers Internet access as well as their own \\nservices. America Online had its own browser, but to keep pace with \\nthe rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with Netscape \\nor Microsoft. For both software companies, a deal with America Online, \\nwhich had 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge \\nin browser use and market share. Netscape seemed the natural partner \\nfor America Online, since both companies were Microsoft rivals. On \\nMarch 11, America Online did announce that it would buy Netscape technology, \\nbut it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula. \\nThe next day, America Online announced a more significant deal with \\nMicrosoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser \\nAmerica Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked \\nfor Netscape's Navigator. To win the deal, Microsoft offered to give \\nAmerica Online a start-up icon on the Windows desktop _ precisely \\nthe kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had \\nasked the Justice Department to require of Microsoft. ``After we agreed \\nto its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us to be bundled \\non the Windows desktop,'' Case said. ``It was an example of Microsoft's \\npragmatic side.'' The pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate \\ngoal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay \\nsoftware business. As a result, its new online service, MSN, would \\nhave to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival, \\nAmerica Online. ``It was Bill's decision,'' said former MSN general \\nmanager Russell Siegelman, referring to Gates. ``He sent me e-mail \\non it. He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagreed \\nwith him.'' To other Microsoft executives, Gates expressed a different \\nview of the likely impact on MSN. He told senior vice president Brad \\nSilverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would \\namount to ``putting a bullet through MSN's head,'' according to a \\ndeposition taken by the Justice Department. In the antitrust suit, \\nthe government asserts that the America Online deal shows how Microsoft \\nused the power of its Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser \\nwar against Netscape. David Colburn, a senior vice president of America \\nOnline who took part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft, is \\na witness for the government. Today, Microsoft has overhauled its \\nInternet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special-interest \\nWeb sites in fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing \\nand news. And it is putting these sites, along with e-mail and search \\nfeatures, in an all-in-one site that uses the name MSN.com. ``I still \\nregard Microsoft as a primary threat,'' Case observed. ``Microsoft \\nhas a history of getting it right in the long run, and there's no \\nreason to think it won't in this business as well. We will always \\nbe in Microsoft's cross hairs.'' THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER \\nAt Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today is \\none of avoiding head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever possible. \\n``Don't do something that is in Microsoft's path _ that's the lesson \\nlearned,'' observed Clark, the Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's \\nventure capitalists, the investors who finance so many of the nation's \\nhigh-tech startups, generally follow the Netscape formula these days. \\nYet that still leaves ample room to prosper. For while competing directly \\nwith Microsoft is dangerous, the software industry as a whole is an \\nengine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. \\nAnd there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship \\nwith Microsoft. For if a start-up cannot steer clear of Microsoft \\nentirely, the favored option is to be bought out by Microsoft, which \\nhas scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising \\ntechnology and people. ``Microsoft understands start-up innovation \\nand how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech \\ncompany,'' said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, \\na venture capital firm. As Microsoft has grown, it has come to be \\nseen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes \\nthe business environment, like a weather front. ``Microsoft is incredibly \\npervasive,'' said Stewart Alsop, a partner with New Enterprise Associates, \\na venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. At the board meetings \\nof the companies in which his firm has invested, two issues always \\ncome up, he said: ``One is the price of the company's stock, and the \\nother is what Microsoft is going to do.'' In the last few years, Microsoft \\nhas offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior \\nMicrosoft executives and leading venture capitalists. The meetings \\nare part of Microsoft's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations \\nwith Silicon Valley. ``We work hard to provide clarity about where \\nwe're going and where we're not going,'' said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's \\nchief financial officer. Last year's conference took place in October \\nat the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the \\nWall Street of high-tech venture investing. Maffei led a team of five \\nMicrosoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists, \\none of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the \\nminds of many of his peers: ``How do I invest in a company that stays \\nout of the way of the steamroller?'' Maffei, recalled one person who \\nattended the meeting, stood up and delivered a brief lecture on businesses \\nthat Microsoft was likely to avoid. His list included specialized \\nsoftware for manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided \\ndesign and others. But, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry \\nappeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software platforms \\nthat might compete with Microsoft's personal computer operating system. \\nAt one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional Venture \\nPartners, leaned over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems \\nand a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield \\n&AMP; Byers, and said quietly, ``I guess that leaves us washing machines \\nand toasters.'' \\n\\nWill it matter to consumers that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy? Until \\nlast week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft \\nCorp., as a genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled \\nvisionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal \\ncomputer. Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice \\nDepartment began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In \\nan antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man \\nwhose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for personal \\ncomputer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian schemer \\nwho will go to almost any length to crush his competition. Product \\ninnovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon for Gates. \\nFlashing back and forth between snippets of Gates' videotaped deposition \\nand e-mail messages he had sent that contradicted his testimony, the \\ngovernment sought to establish a pattern of threats and offers of \\npayments by the Microsoft chairman. It also sought to cast Gates as \\nan obsessed man who feared the tiny Netscape Communications Corp. \\nand its potential threat to his domination of the market for Internet \\nbrowsers, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Gates \\nwas portrayed by Justice Department litigator David Boies as a schoolyard \\nbully who rides roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness \\nthat is in stark contrast to his popular image as a benevolent dictator \\nand high-technology guru. According to a document presented by Boies, \\nfor example, Gates asked America Online executives in 1996: ``How \\nmuch do we need to pay you'' to damage Netscape? ``This is your lucky \\nday.'' The implication, Boies said, was that the amount was irrelevant, \\nand that Microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance, makes \\nas many ``offers you can't refuse'' as needed to achieve its goals. \\nMicrosoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any hint \\nthat the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting from \\nthe company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public \\nwill continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive \\nbusiness tactics and the company's software. ``Despite what you're \\nreading in the press, people judge us by our products,'' said Mich \\nMatthews, head of Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. ``Our \\nexperience is that people vote with their pocketbooks.'' So far, consumers \\nare casting positive votes. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly \\nprofits of $1.52 billion, a stunning 58 percent increase over the \\nlevel a year earlier. Despite the record profits, some marketing experts \\nsay that if the public comes to view Gates as a Rockefeller-style \\nrobber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer. ``When you \\nhave a company with such a visible chief executive, the CEO is really \\nthe driver of the brand,'' said David Aaker, a brand marketing expert \\nat the Haas School of Business at the University of California at \\nBerkeley. ``There is no question this is going to affect Microsoft's \\nbrand recognition.'' Already there are early warning signals, as political \\ncartoons in newspapers across the country bashed Gates last week. \\nOne showed him holding a globe and saying, ``If you don't play my \\nway, I'll take my ball and go home''; another portrayed the Microsoft \\nchairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window \\nwhile a Microsoft secretary says to a caller, ``I'm sorry, but Mr. \\nGates is busy teaching a competitor about Windows.'' But some industry \\nanalysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates who knows how to play \\nhardball may not be such a bad thing for his company. The he-said, \\nshe-said round of e-mail messages being dragged out in court cases \\nboth in Washington and in Silicon Valley, where Microsoft is locked \\nin a legal battle with its archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed \\nby some as little different from the exaggerated trash talking that \\ngoes on in professional sports. ``It's like taking what Charles Barkley \\nand Michael Jordan say to each other on the ball court'' and turning \\nit into something more sinister than it really is, said Paul Andrews, \\nco-author with Stephen Manes of ``Gates'' (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, \\nthere is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company has \\nso far taken root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon \\nValley, where the computer industry has long felt the impact of Gates' \\ntactics, and where bitterness and distrust of Microsoft are deep. \\nIn the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great popularity. \\nTwo weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 students \\nat Indiana University, a questioner who asked about the Justice Department's \\nsuit was roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times \\nNews Service Is Bill Gates a high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. \\n1 or a threat to the known universe? All three, judging from the numerous \\npolitical cartoons that popped up in newspapers across the country \\nlast week. From Chattanooga to Boston, cartoonists took delight in \\ndemonizing Gates, who is facing an unexpected public relations challenge \\nas Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in Washington. Other cartoons \\nran the gamut from the predictable (a worker, pointing to an aquarium \\nin which a large fish is gobbling up smaller ones, saying to some \\nvisitors, ``Welcome to Microsoft's research and development department'') \\nto the weird (a dweebish man hunched in front of a computer screen \\nstaring at the words: ``Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is under attack. \\nLeave your possessions. Go to the desert. Await the spaceship''). \\nAnd that was just Week One of the trial. Stay tuned. \\n\\nThe case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most \\naggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing \\nout against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court \\nrulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to \\nsupport their opposing arguments. Whatever the outcome of the trial, \\nscheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington, an \\nalmost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of \\nbringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines. \\nThe case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that \\ncontrols about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today. The \\ngovernment says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business \\npractices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable \\nto the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the \\ncase is intended to give the government control over which features \\ncan be added to Windows. However grand the economic stakes, the legal \\ndispute is narrow. The government says that Microsoft's contracts \\nwith computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access \\nto the Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit \\nmanufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator \\nbrowser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them \\nfrom removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites \\non the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's \\ncontracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with \\nbusinesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored \\ntreatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links \\non the Windows desktop. In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft has \\nvoluntarily dropped some of these requirements, though it could reinstate \\nthem at will. Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because \\nthey produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet \\naccess. The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer \\nwith Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows \\n98 amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers \\nof one product to purchase another. The contracts with manufacturers \\nand Internet services are illegal, the government says, because they \\nare intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but \\nto protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating systems. The \\nlatter threat is key, according to the Justice Department. Browsers \\nhave the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software \\nplatform on which other programs run. So contracts intended to drive \\nbrowsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly. \\nMany antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department \\nis that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and \\nno clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary. \\nProfessor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief economist \\nof the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, \\nsays that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact \\nit is ubiquitous. No one, he said, ``would challenge the right of \\nmanufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile \\nor buttons to shirts.'' His point, shared widely among economists, \\nis that some tying benefits consumers if, for example, it results \\nin products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover \\ndevelopment costs. But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power. \\nThe courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing \\ngood tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute. Microsoft \\nsays it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes \\nwhat might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits test _ that it \\noffers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage \\nto competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers. The Justice \\nDepartment says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle: \\nyielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough \\nto balance possible long-term harm to competition. So which test of \\nconsumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer is that \\nno one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite \\nthe same cases without fear of embarrassment. Consider a 1985 case, \\nAspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, \\nLorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In the first, Aspen Skiing, \\nthe owner of three major ski runs in Aspen, Colo. _ the monopolist \\n_ had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands, \\na competitor, that gave skiers access to both companies' runs. When \\nAspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues \\nshriveled and the rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing \\nhad violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action \\nhelped consumers. In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper \\nin Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised \\non a new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the \\nexclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers. Indeed, in \\nAspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business \\nwith its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department, \\nwhich seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside \\nits own. But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that \\nin both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because \\nthey offered no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounced \\non practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service. \\nNor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits \\nagainst hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's \\npractices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, \\nunlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's \\ncontracts do not prevent consumers from installing Netscape's browser \\nor from using the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, \\nneither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product \\ndesign. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, \\nanother case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized \\nthat surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service. \\nYet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not \\nbe allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists \\nif consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately. That \\nprinciple could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence \\nof Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point \\nto a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard \\nfor the government to meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also \\ndraw support from several court rulings that allowed IBM to change \\nthe design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors \\nto attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument \\nis that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which \\nthe courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the \\nbasis of a balancing test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer \\nclear of redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice \\nDepartment's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust \\nlaw is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices \\nthat provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out \\ncompetition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department \\nwill ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least \\nexclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide \\ncustomers. Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's \\nrestrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test. \\nBut exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped \\nor hurt is up for grabs. A balancing test would have the courts weigh \\nthe immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet \\nsites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus \\nthe harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers \\nand operating systems. But a test that makes good sense in theory \\ncan prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. ``Balancing tests \\nare impossibly difficult and arbitrary,'' said Rep. Thomas Campbell, \\nR-Calif., who is a former law professor at Stanford University. ``The \\npractical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft \\nalmost certain victory.'' Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts \\nagree _ that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing \\ntest toward a simpler ``predation'' test for exclusionary contracts. \\nUnder this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended \\nto drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist \\nto raise prices later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending \\nitself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing \\nits customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that \\nits bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good. The \\nantitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division \\nunder President Reagan, is littered with ``contradictory, ambiguous \\nand sometimes nonsensical'' verdicts. He and other legal experts agree \\nthat if nothing else, that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for \\nthe Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the \\nspine of the antitrust law. \\n\\nThe case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most \\naggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing \\nout against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court \\nrulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to \\nsupport their opposing arguments.

He and other legal experts agree \\nthat if nothing else, that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for \\nthe Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the \\nspine of the antitrust law. \\n\\nThe legal tool that the government is using in its assault on Microsoft \\nCorp. _ the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 _ is brief, vague and malleable. \\nThe combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy \\nhas been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending \\non the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts. \\nSponsored by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger \\nbrother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act \\nwas passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the \\nindustrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. Farmers, laborers and \\nsmall-business owners _ sizable voting groups _ resented the trusts \\nas vehicles of concentrated power. But the trusts, large national \\nholding corporations, were viewed by many others as engines of modernization \\nand industrialization. Economists at the time opposed the Sherman \\nAct, and the law that Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise. \\nNo one knew what impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in \\nMatthew Josephson's ``The Robber Barons,'' explained that nearly everyone \\nagreed that ``something must be flung out to appease the restive masses.'' \\nThe act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention ``conspiracy,'' \\n``restraint of trade'' and ``attempt to monopolize.'' Yet while the \\nSherman Act is now interpreted as the Magna Carta of competition, \\nit never uses the term. After it was passed, critics of the trusts \\nderided the ``impenetrable'' language of the Sherman Act and called \\nit the Swiss Cheese Act. But by the early 1900s, the political climate \\nhad changed. The growing antagonism for the trusts, especially as \\nincome gaps widened, was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore \\nRoosevelt, who became president in 1901. ``The Sherman Act has always \\nbeen an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived \\nexploitation and the aggregation of power,'' said Eleanor Fox, a professor \\nat the New York University Law School. The model trust _ and the principal \\ntarget of the trustbusters _ was Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt \\nmade a distinction between good trusts, which thrived because of their \\nsuperior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew not as the result \\nof inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices. \\nThroughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained \\nabout the company and the business practices of its founder, John \\nD. Rockefeller. But during those years, the price of kerosene _ burned \\nto light the nation's homes _declined steadily. So Standard Oil, it \\ncould could reasonably be argued, was an ``enterprising monopoly.'' \\nIn the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the United \\nStates to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price \\nwar against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face \\ngenuine competition. When consumers were hurt by the Standard Oil \\nmonopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company \\nswelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard \\nTaft. The federal suit against Standard Oil was filed in 1906, and \\nthe Supreme Court approved the breakup of the company in 1911. Standard \\nOil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes. \\nBoth were dominant companies of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft \\nchairman, has been called a modern Rockefeller. ``But there is no \\npresidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction \\nin the Microsoft case,'' said Ron Chernow, author of ``Titan,'' a \\nbest-selling biography of Rockefeller. ``And Rockefeller,'' Chernow \\nadded, ``never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread \\npublic adulation and favorable press coverage as Bill Gates has had.'' \\n\\nThe government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest \\nindependent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic \\nadministrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators. \\nBut it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated \\npublic policy. Nor, by all accounts, of politics. Instead, like the \\nsoftware industry itself, the government's pursuit of Microsoft has \\ntaken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled \\nor predicted back when it started in 1989. It was in November of that \\nyear, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las \\nVegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd \\nbeen dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from IBM \\n_ which at the time dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry. \\nThe two companies _ IBM, then the leading maker of personal computers \\nand Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software _ were collaborating \\non the design and marketing of a new operating system called OS/2. \\nBut Microsoft was also beginning to sell a competing product, Windows. \\nThe industry trade press was full of worried articles: which system \\nwas going to become the new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably \\nat his side, James Cannavino, an IBM divisional president, said that \\nthe two companies wanted to ``clear the air.'' OS/2 was the future, \\nhe said. As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product \\nfor under-equipped computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive \\nall the advanced features of OS/2. Gates certainly did not look happy. \\nBut he did not disagree. The news conference got little attention, \\njust a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications. \\nBut a few weeks later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer \\nwith the Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles, \\nin Byte magazine. ``IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified \\nvision of graphical operating environments,'' the article said, ``and \\nit looks sort of like a U.S. economic model,'' divided into lower-, \\nmiddle- and upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft \\nwere colluding to divide the operating-system market _ a potential \\nviolation of antitrust law. Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation \\nof Microsoft and IBM And since that small first step, Microsoft has \\nbeen under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators \\nfor a constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month \\nafter month, year after year, for the last nine years. Now comes the \\nantitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with a multiplicity \\nof charges woven of threads drawn from more than a dozen different \\ninvestigative inquiries during that nine-year span. Microsoft, today \\nthe most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market \\nvalue of nearly $234 billion, presents a huge and highly visible antitrust \\ntarget. Yet, while the company's allies ask, ``What is the Clinton \\nadministration's political agenda in going after Microsoft?'' the \\nanswer seems to be there is none. In interviews, more than a dozen \\ncurrent and former senior antitrust officials _ whether friends of \\nthe government or of Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's \\nantitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations. \\nAs for politics, all the officials agreed that the antitrust division \\noperates independent of the administration's political considerations. \\nCharles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust \\ndivision during the Bush administration, and he is now a Washington \\nlawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for Microsoft. ``When \\nI was there,'' Rule said of his Justice days, ``the White House was \\npunctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided \\nto do. There was no communication between antitrust and other branches \\nof government.'' Asked if he believed that policy had changed under \\nthe Clinton administration, he said: ``Not really. I've seen nothing \\nto suggest it.'' Joel Klein heads the antitrust division now, and \\nin an interview dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's \\ntechnology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case, \\nhe said: ``There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter, \\ncivil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without \\nany political contact.'' Klein said, by way of examples, that he might \\ndiscuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with \\nthe Defense Department or Transportation Department. ``But never the \\nWhite House,'' he said. ``For a significant case, we might call the \\nWhite House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press \\nconference.' '' ``The last time there was any interference,'' he added, \\n``was the Dita Beard-ITT case.'' Mrs. Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp., \\nwas accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000 \\ndonation to the Republican National Convention had ``gone a long way'' \\ntoward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the \\nNixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity of the \\nmemo was never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In \\nany case, Klein says, ``since Watergate, it's been immaculate.'' In \\nthe case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President \\nAl Gore has ever volunteered a comment. In answer to a question during \\na news conference in May, just before the suit was filed, Clinton \\nsaid: ``I have taken the view that I should not comment on matters \\nwithin the Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should \\ndepart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will \\nhave a big impact on an important sector of our economy. But I have \\nto say, based on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way \\nthe antitrust division in the Justice Department has handled the matter.'' \\nSince then, Clinton has said nothing else about the case, publicly \\nat least. And Gore, who generally represents the administration on \\ntechnology issues, has never commented at all. In Rule's opinion, \\nthe administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it \\nwere politically acceptable to do so. ``It would be a little odd for \\nthe administration to push the Justice Department in this suit,'' \\nhe said. ``It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake. I \\nwould be hard pressed to explain why they would do that.'' Taking \\nsides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly \\nsince the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley companies for political \\ndonations and support. In fact, the present and former government \\nofficials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the \\ninquiries conducted during the last nine years. They began at the \\nFTC. Soon after Washington read that article in Byte, the FTC staff \\nopened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question. But as has happened \\nso often in the following years, turns in the market made the initial \\ninquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned its agreement with IBM, and \\nWindows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remained \\na cipher. But as that issue faded, once government investigators began \\nlooking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them. In \\n1991 Washington, who still works for the FTC, informed Microsoft that \\nthe investigation was being expanded. The agency, his letter said, \\nwas now trying to determine whether Microsoft was using its dominant \\nposition in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other \\nareas. That general idea lies at the heart of the present suit. One \\nformer senior FTC official said the commission staff had confidence \\nin the case but realized that the Reagan-era commissioners, who had \\nto approve any suit, might have a different view. ``We knew the commission \\nmight have difficulty with a monopolization case,'' the former official \\nsaid. ``They hadn't brought a case in years.'' And in fact, in 1993 \\nthe commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal \\ncharges. The deadlock served as a dismissal. Then, a few months later, \\nthe Justice Department decided to pick up the case. ``It was farther \\nalong than most cases we got,'' recalled Robert Litan, a former senior \\nofficial in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now \\nat the Brookings Institution. ``Usually a case would be two or three \\npeople complaining and a few documents,'' he said. ``But this was \\na fully researched record. They gave us the files and briefed us on \\nwhat they had done.'' The Justice Department lawyers picked up the \\nsame thread. ``The general idea behind our inquiry,'' Litan said, \\n``was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating \\nsystems to cement a monopoly in other areas.'' In 1995, Microsoft \\nand the government reached a consent agreement in which the company \\npromised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft \\noperating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every \\ncomputer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. \\nThe company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product \\nto the sale of another. The charges in the present suit are similar \\nin many ways. Even with the agreement, the government investigations \\ncontinued. That same year, Justice Department investigators showed \\nup at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp. for the first time \\nto ask questions about their next line of inquiry. ``America Online \\nhad been complaining,'' a senior Netscape executive recalled, ``because \\nMicrosoft was bundling the Microsoft Network,'' a competing online \\nservice, ``with Windows.'' Once more, market forces overtook the investigation. \\nThe Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America \\nOnline prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints filled \\nthe void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general \\nwho headed the antitrust division, remarked: ``We get complaints about \\nMicrosoft all the time. We have become a kind of Microsoft complaints \\ncenter. And we take them very seriously.'' In 1996, Netscape's first \\ncomplaint arrived. In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape \\nsaid that Microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating \\nsystems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's \\nbrowser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed \\nby Netscape. The next year the Justice Department formally charged \\nMicrosoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows \\nto installation of the company's Web browser on new computers. ``It \\nseemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree,'' a natural \\nextension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the department \\nby then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court \\npanel overturned that ruling this summer. In the meantime, last May \\nthe Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their \\nnew suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday. \\nIt contends that Microsoft has engaged in bundling, tying and other \\npredatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations \\nand investigations of the last nine years. ``A good part of this case \\nis just Round II of the case we dealt with in Round I,'' in the early \\nin the 1990s, Litan said. Or, as the former senior FTC official put \\nit, ``there's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through \\nhere.'' But through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled \\nand spun by hundreds of different hands. \\n\\nA federal judge Friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust \\ntrial against Microsoft Corp. by four days, to Oct. 19, while also \\nordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request \\nto examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argued that allowing \\n``an army of government attorneys to come in and make demands will \\nmake it very difficult for us to remain in business.'' But after winning \\nassurances from government lawyers that they would make only narrow, \\ntargeted searches of the records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of \\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered Microsoft \\nto open the database for perusal. Microsoft had asked that the trial \\nbe delayed several more months to prepare a defense against what it \\nsaid was a last minute broadening of the case by the Justice Department, \\nwhich had added new evidence. Last month, the government said that \\nin the process of preparing for the trial it had discovered that Microsoft \\ntried to persuade Apple Computer not to market its Quicktime multimedia \\nsoftware to Windows customers. On Thursday, the Justice Department \\nand 20 states added two new people to their witness list to testify \\nabout Microsoft dealings with Apple and with Sun Microsystems. Avi \\nTevanian, a former Apple executive, was added to the witness list \\nin part to describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft denies ever \\nhaving made. The other new witness was James Gosling, a Sun executive \\nwho led the development of Java, an Internet programming language \\nthat Microsoft sees as a potential threat to the company's dominance \\nof the software market. The government is charging that Microsoft \\ntook illegal steps to prevent Java from gaining wide acceptance. To \\ncounter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, \\na senior Microsoft executive who has worked with Sun, and Chris Engstrom, \\nan executive who handled some of Microsoft's dealings with Apple. \\nAt the same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that the \\nnew allegations had no place in the case. The Justice Department, \\nWarden told the judge, was ``trying to turn this into something approximating \\na plenary monopoly case like the IBM case.'' ``It becomes clearer \\nand clearer and clearer with each new filing that they are trying \\nto turn this into a broader case,'' he said. ``You can't have this \\nbait-and-switch in which they file a complaint alleging A, B, C, and \\nthen talk about the whole alphabet three times over.'' As a result, \\nWarden said, Microsoft wanted, at a minimum, another two-week delay, \\neven though ``a more normal schedule'' would have the trial start \\nnext year. The judge did not respond. Instead he entered an order \\nsetting the Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered a formal \\nmotion asking for another two-week delay. A response is expected next \\nweek. \\n\\nShortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft \\nCorp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge \\nof the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon \\nValley executive. The executive recalls telling Klein that unless \\na case went beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little \\neffect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer \\nindustry. Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's \\nconcerns. But he said time was running short and the strongest evidence \\nin hand involved Microsoft's battle against Netscape Communications \\nCorp. in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating \\nthe Internet. ``This is a Netscape case,'' the executive recalls Klein \\nsaying. But five months later, the case that the government is bringing \\nto trial on Monday extends well beyond Netscape and the browser war \\nto embrace what it described in a recent court filing as ``a broad \\npattern of anti-competitive conduct'' by Microsoft. Netscape, the \\ngovernment insists, is still a prime example of the pattern _ but \\nonly one of several examples. The 12-person witness list for the Justice \\nDepartment and 20 states suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence \\nadded to the case since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president \\nand chief executive, will appear first, but he will be followed by \\nexecutives representing a cross section of the nation's high-technology \\ncompanies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, \\nAmerica Online and Intuit. In bringing a more ambitious, complicated \\ncase to trial than the one it filed in May, the government has chosen \\na high-risk strategy. The law states that new evidence can be added \\nto a suit after it is filed, but not new charges. And so, in his federal \\ncourtroom in Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson \\ncould decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far \\nafield from the original suit. But if the government wins its broadened \\ncase, the court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher on \\nMicrosoft. In May, the government's suggested steps amounted to equal \\ntreatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But the \\ngovernment recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on \\nremedies, if it wins the case. The remedies under consideration now \\ninclude more basic changes in Microsoft's business practices _ perhaps \\neven a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen Microsoft's grip \\non computing. That would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform \\nthat Microsoft's foes would applaud. ``The government has doubled \\nthe bet and doubled the stakes,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at \\nthe Harvard business school who is co-author of the book, ``Competing \\non Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft.'' \\nMeanwhile, in the Microsoft camp, the government's strategy is dismissed \\nas a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in June that threatened \\nto undermine the antitrust suit. That ruling came in a separate case, \\ninvolving the interpretation of the consent decree that Microsoft \\nsigned with the Justice Department in 1995. In the June ruling, a \\nfederal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser \\nwith its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them \\none product. The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion \\nin the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the \\noperating system were two separate products, bundled together and \\ngiven away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market. \\n``With the appeals-court ruling in June, the government lost the heart \\nof its case,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior official in the \\nJustice Department, who is now a consultant to Microsoft. ``So it \\nhas taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything \\nit can find _ even evidence the Justice Department has had for years \\n_ into the gun barrel and see what hits.'' The June appellate ruling \\ndid shake the prosecution team. But mostly it strengthened the hand \\nof those within the Justice Department who had been urging that the \\ncase be broadened, according to people who have worked on the investigation. \\nAt the same time, they say, new evidence was coming in as the investigation \\nmoved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule \\napproved by the court. Speed was a priority from the outset, they \\nsay. The Justice Department and the states filed their suit in May \\nto move before Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, was introduced \\nin June. While not seeking to block the release of Windows 98, government \\nlawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as \\nPC makers and computer users adopt this latest version of Microsoft's \\nWindows operating system, which functions as the central nervous system \\nfor more than 90 percent of personal computers sold. The key allegations, \\ngovernment lawyers note, have not changed since May _ namely, that \\nMicrosoft illegally used its market power in operating systems to \\ndefend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets. \\n``But the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the \\nMay filing was the browser,'' said one person who worked on the case. \\n``The real game plan was always to get a broader case.'' What is more, \\none person noted, the prosecution team was not at full strength until \\nshortly before the suit was filed. David Boies, a renowned courtroom \\nlitigator and a former partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who \\nsuccessfully defended IBM in its 13-year confrontation with the government, \\nwas named as special counsel for the Justice Department last December. \\nBut Boies, who left Cravath last year, did not start working full-time \\nfor the Justice Department until mid-April, because he was still finishing \\nprivate cases for his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust \\nsuit filed in May leaned heavily on the Netscape story, mentioning \\nMicrosoft's main rival in the browser market some 130 times in the \\ncomplaint and a supporting memorandum. But it also prominently mentioned \\nMicrosoft's tactics against Sun Microsystems, creator of Java, an \\nInternet programming language, and cited it as an ``example'' of Microsoft's \\nbehavior. ``It was crafted as a template that could be added to without \\nmuch stretching,'' one person involved in the case said. And so, as \\nnew evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern, Klein step \\nby step approved the widening of the case, the person said. And that \\nexplains, the person continued, how it is that evidence that has been \\nin the hands of the Justice Department for years has been added to \\nthe case since May; only after gathering new evidence did it become \\napparent that the older material fit the pattern of the current case. \\nFor example, the government has added the contention that Microsoft \\npressured Intel Corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner \\nof Microsoft, to curb its development efforts in multimedia and Internet \\nsoftware because they might conflict with Microsoft's plans. The government \\ncontends that the arm-twisting occurred at meetings between the two \\ncompanies three years ago, especially one on Aug. 2, 1995, which was \\nattended by Andrew Grove, the Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, the \\nMicrosoft chairman. Part of the government's evidence in the Intel-Microsoft \\nepisode is copies of the handwritten notes taken by Steven McGeady, \\nan Intel vice president who attended the meetings, and a memo written \\nby him on Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still under court seal, said that \\nGates ``made vague threats'' and was ``livid'' about Intel's investments \\nin the Internet ``and wanted them stopped.'' A handwritten note, also \\nunder court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, a Microsoft executive, as saying \\nthat Netscape is their ``common enemy'' and that Intel's role should \\nbe to ``fill in stuff in and around Microsoft's strategy.'' These \\ndocuments were sent by Intel to the Justice Department's office in \\nSan Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil Investigative \\nDemand _ a civil subpoena _ served on Intel on Nov. 10, 1995. On its \\nown, the Intel material was intriguing, but it became part of the \\nantitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced, one person close to \\nthe case said. The government is contending that Microsoft also tried \\nto urge Apple to stop selling its Quicktime multimedia software in \\nthe Windows market and tried to convince Real Networks Inc. to pull \\nback in the market for so-called streaming software. The government \\ncase has also broadened, people involved in the case say, as more \\nwitnesses from the industry have been increasingly willing to testify. \\n``In the beginning, most people in the industry believed that the \\ngovernment would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they came forward,'' \\none person said. ``But as the strength of our case was perceived to \\nimprove, more people were willing to come forward, and things snowballed. \\nYou get Intel, it's easier to get Apple and so on.'' \\n\", \"\\nThe control tower is still without controls, the check-in counter \\nhas no computers and the runway can't function after dark for lack \\nof flood lights. Despite such temporary shortcomings, Gaza International \\nAirport is set to open Tuesday, aided by a little improvisation and \\na lot of patriotic pride. ``It's a glorious feeling of independence, \\na feeling that we are open to the world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian \\nwatching while workers painted white lines Monday on the tarmac in \\nthe southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. Palestinian \\nleader Yasser Arafat planned to be on hand Tuesday morning when a \\nplane from Cairo carrying Egyptian officials becomes the first arrival. \\nAt half-hour intervals, six more planes are to come in from places \\nsuch as Morocco and Spain. The European Union, which donated dlrs \\n38 million for equipment and training, is sending its Mideast envoy \\non a special plane. The airport opening had been held up for two years \\nbecause of disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over \\nIsrael's role in monitoring passengers and cargo. In the end, Israel \\nwill have a say over who and what is coming into the Gaza, but the \\nIsraeli monitors will operate discretely, behind one-way mirrors, \\nas they do now at the Rafah and Allenby Bridge crossings into autonomous \\nPalestinian areas. The airport protocol was signed last week, as part \\nof the Wye River land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians. \\nTomer Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza, \\nsaid periodic security closures, which bar Palestinians from entering \\nIsrael, would not effect the operation of the airport. He said Israel \\nwas inspecting certain gear such as X-ray machines and electro-magnet \\nequipment for safety but that it wouldn't hold-up the airport from \\nopening. The head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, Fayez \\nZeidan, was not available Monday for comment. For the time being, \\nit will still be a bit of an adventure to fly out of Gaza International \\nor to land there. Palestinian officials say the equipment for the \\ncontrol tower, the computers for the check-in counters and the flood \\nlights are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Nir Yarkoni, a spokesman \\nfor Israel's Civil Aviation Authority, acknowledged delays in some \\nof the equipment reaching Dahanieh but said he did not know the reasons. \\nDegani, from the Israeli military government, said some equipment \\nwas being held up by customs. Portable control, 12th graf pvs \\n\\nIsraeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from \\nthe Palestinian airport on Wednesday, the latest tensions in a rare \\narea of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation. A plane bound for Amman, \\nJordan was delayed for two hours over an Israeli demand that Palestinian \\nofficials inspect the luggage of a Palestinian passenger, Israel radio \\nreported. The plane left with the passenger aboard, but without his \\nluggage. Israeli officials also delayed a plane making a stopover \\nfrom Saudi Arabia to Cairo, it said. Israeli airport security officials \\nwere not available for comment. Abdel Razek Yehia, a Palestinian official \\nwho helped negotiate the airport's opening, confirmed the delays. \\nHe said such differences did not undermine the peace process. ``Every \\nday we have differences,'' he told The Associated Press. ``We are \\nall doing all our best to continue the peace process.'' The airport's \\nopening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by U.S. President \\nBill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, was hailed by Palestinians \\nas a milestone toward independence and statehood. Israel retains security \\ncontrol over flights arriving at Gaza International Airport, and Palestinian \\nsecurity officials consult with their Israeli counterparts. Earlier \\nthis week, Israel threatened to close down the Gaza airport when Palestinian \\nairport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check \\nthe identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane, most \\nof whom worked for the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian officials \\nsaid that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his entourage were \\naboard the plane in question, and that exempted the plane from Israeli \\nsecurity checks. Since Wye, Israel has accused the Palestinians of \\nfailing to contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. \\nThe Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement \\nto release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities. \\n\\nAmid a flurry of last minute preparations, the young Palestinian Authority \\nprepared Thursday for a milestone on the road to maturity: its very \\nown airport. As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and \\nPalestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday \\nand Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would \\nopen Sunday. The airport has been nearly completed for months but \\nThursday officials there added a few extra touches of yellow paint \\nand fresh flowers. It was not clear who would be the first arrivals \\nat the airport. Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may \\ntravel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. Others hinted \\nthe first international flight may be reserved for U.S. President \\nBill Clinton who is scheduled to visit Gaza in December. Egypt's Middle \\nEast News Agency said the first plane to land would be carrying Egypt's \\nhealth minister and several doctors bearing medical supplies as gifts. \\nIsrael, which will oversee security at the airport, has forbidden \\nits own citizens from using the airport initially, Israel's Channel \\n2 TV said. And all flights, which must be approved by Israel in advance, \\nwould not be allowed to fly over their airspace. After touring the \\nairport Thursday, a U.S. official said more work needed to be done \\nbefore the airport was ready for Clinton. ``It may be a landing site \\nfor President Clinton, but we're not confirming,'' said the official \\nwho spoke on condition of anonymity. ``When you fly Air Force One, \\nyou're flying several planes and a lot of equipment,'' he said. The \\nairport will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians will \\nhave out of the Gaza Strip. \\n\\nIsraeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from \\nthe Palestinian airport on Wednesday, marking the latest tensions \\nin a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation. \\n\\nTaking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday \\ninaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the \\nworld, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism. An Egypt \\nAir plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern \\nGaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt). But the emotional highlight was \\nthe touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50. \\nAfter landing, the pilot and co-pilot raised Palestinian flags high \\nabove their heads as they descended the stairway. A chant of ``Allahu \\nAkbar,'' or God is Great, rose from of a crowd of thousands of Palestinians \\nwho had pushed their way onto the airfield to join the celebrations. \\n``You are a beautiful sight,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat later \\ntold the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishly decorated with \\ndeep red Oriental carpets and wall mosaics. Throughout the morning, \\nArafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes \\nfrom Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian \\nAirlines flights. ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the \\nPalestinian state,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V \\nsign. However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has the \\nauthority to shut down the airfield at any time. It will monitor arriving \\npassengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out if it considers \\nthem a danger to Israeli security. Disputes between Israel and the \\nPalestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening \\nfor more than two years. In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian \\nsecurity agents approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and \\ncollected the passports of the passengers, including Egyptian Cabinet \\nministers and comedian Adel Imam, in white bags. Throughout the morning, \\nthere were spontaneous celebrations. As a police marching band played \\nbagpipes, airport workers, policemen and Cabinet ministers held each \\nother by their hands and danced in a circle. Some kissed and embraced \\ntheir neighbors, others wiped away tears and several officers waved \\ntheir rifles in the air. In one corner of the airfield, about 300 \\npeople gathered around a man and a boy riding mules that moved to \\nthe beat of drums. The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost \\nto the troubled Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian \\nflowers and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, \\noften with difficulties and delays. The airfield will also make it \\neasier for Palestinians to travel abroad, although a majority of Gazans \\nare probably too poor to be able to afford an air ticket. Until now, \\nPalestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission to enter Israel \\nand fly out of Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv. The \\nother option was to travel by land to Jordan and catch flights there. \\nPalestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross \\nIsrael into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is expected to become \\neasier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza opens next \\nmonth. Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian \\nairport, citing security reasons. However, Israeli Foreign Minister \\nAriel Sharon said Tuesday that this might change in the future. The \\nopening of the airport was negotiated during last month's U.S.-sponsored \\nMideast summit near Washington. As part of the accord, Israel also \\nwithdrew troops in the northern West Bank last week and released 250 \\nPalestinian prisoners. A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza \\nand Israel is to open next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations \\non a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing. Gaza International, \\nwith the call letters LVGZ, was designed in an Oriental style with \\ngraceful arches and elaborate tiles imported from Morocco. The airport \\nhas one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long \\nrunway. A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control \\ntower wall.

The Falcon F-50 short-haul plane carried 48 passengers, \\nmostly Palestinian businessmen and students. The plane will return \\nlater in the day. Last weekend, the Palestinians inaugurated an airport \\nin the Mediterranean city of Gaza under the U.S.-brokered Wye River \\naccord which envisages Israel ceding more lands to the Palestinians \\nin return for security guarantees. Jasser Ziyyad, director-general \\nof the Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority, said Jordan agreed with \\nthe Palestinians earlier in the week on four weekly flights between \\nthem _ two by the Palestinian airline and two for Jordan. Meanwhile, \\nJordanian newspapers quoted unnamed Palestinian aviation officials \\nas saying one more passenger plane will be added to the Palestinian \\nfleet of three short-haul aircraft.

As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli \\nand Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport \\nFriday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport \\nwould open Sunday. The airport has been nearly completed for months. \\nOn Thursday, officials added a few extra touches of yellow paint and \\nfresh flowers. It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at \\nthe airport. Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel \\nby car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. Others hinted the \\nfirst international flight may be reserved for U.S. President Bill \\nClinton who is scheduled to visit Gaza in December. Egypt's Middle \\nEast News Agency said the first plane to land would be carrying Egypt's \\nhealth minister and several doctors bearing medical supplies as gifts. \\nIsrael, which will oversee security at the airport, has forbidden \\nits own citizens from using the airport initially, Israel's Channel \\n2 TV said. All flights, which must be approved by Israel in advance, \\nwould not be allowed to fly over Israeli airspace. After touring the \\nairport Thursday, a U.S. official said more work was needed to be \\ndone before the airport was ready for Clinton. ``It may be a landing \\nsite for President Clinton, but we're not confirming,'' said the official \\nwho spoke on condition of anonymity. ``When you fly Air Force One, \\nyou're flying several planes and a lot of equipment,'' he said.

Bin Laden, believed \\nto be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a \\nU.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and are \\naccused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States. \\nThe State Department also announced a reward of up to dlrs 5 million \\nfor bin Laden's capture. ``It is a challenge to the entire Muslim \\nworld ... Bin Laden is a hero of the Muslim world,'' said Omar Warsi, \\na leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, \\nor Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. ``If anything happens \\nto him, America will be responsible.'' Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers \\nare fighting in neighboring Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, \\nwhich rules 90 percent of Afghanistan and has imposed a strict version \\nof Islamic law in those areas. Warsi's group is well-armed with everything \\nfrom machine guns to rocket launchers. In Pakistan, it has been blamed \\nin killings of hundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom the group reviles \\nas non-Muslims based on a centuries-old dispute over who was the proper \\nsuccessor to the Prophet Mohammed. Harakat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based \\norganization labeled a terrorist group by the United States, said, \\nhowever, that foreigners in Pakistan ``have nothing to fear from us.'' \\nHarakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden, and several \\nHarakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack on alleged \\nbin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan. ``What the United States does \\nis their business,'' said Abdul Bassit, a Harakat follower. He added, \\nhowever, that the United States should know bin Laden ``is a good \\nMuslim, and all the Muslim world thinks he is a good Muslim.'' The \\nTaliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be extradited. \\nHowever, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept evidence of \\nbin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have promised to \\nprosecute him if the evidence warrants it. Washington blames bin Laden's \\ngroup, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya \\nand Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured \\nan estimated 5,000 people. The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing \\nTomahawk cruise missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in \\neastern Afghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, but damage to \\nthe area was not considered extensive. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan \\nevacuated nonessential staff and family members prior to the August \\nbombing of Afghanistan, fearing retaliation. While some embassy workers \\nare back, their dependents and about 30 percent of the staff have \\nnot been allowed to return. Embassy officials said no fresh security \\nwarnings followed Wednesday's indictment. Security measures already \\nin place include cement barricades blocking the road leading to the \\nU.S. Embassy in Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping the \\nbrick-walled compound. In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, \\non the border with Afghanistan, the U.S. consulate is surrounded by \\nbarbed wire and protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozens \\nof armed police. \\n\\nA federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a 238-count indictment \\nWednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden with conspiring \\nto bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August and with committing \\nacts of terrorism against Americans abroad. Government officials immediately \\nannounced that they were offering two rewards of $5 million each for \\ninformation leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another \\nman charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's \\nchief military commander. Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan \\nunder the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement \\nthat rules that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown. Prosecutors \\nalso unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June, that included \\nsimilar but less detailed charges against bin Laden. That indictment \\nwas returned before the embassy bombings and was the result of a two-year \\ninvestigation into his activities in Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as \\nwell as reports that he had connections to a circle of Islamic militants \\nin Brooklyn. The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, \\naccused bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 \\nto the present, in which he was said to be working in concert with \\ngovernments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist \\ngroups, to build weapons and attack American military installations. \\nBut the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged involvement \\nin the embassy attacks. The indictment does not, for example, specify \\nwhether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden gave direct orders \\nto those who carried out the attacks. Nothing in the document indicates \\nwhy the original indictment was kept secret for months, but the secret \\ncharges were returned about the time that American officials were \\nplotting a possible raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden. Mary \\nJo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``It's very common \\nto have sealed indictments when you're trying to apprehend those who \\nare indicted.'' Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's \\noperations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq \\nto cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin Laden's \\nagreeing not to work against that country. No details were given about \\nwhether the alleged deal with Iraq led to the development of actual \\nweapons for bin Laden's group, which is called Al Qaeda. The government \\nsaid Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used private relief groups \\n``as conduits for transmitting funds'' for Al Qaeda. The groups were \\nnot identified. Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted \\ninternal investigations of its members and their associates, trying \\nto detect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those \\nwho had been suspected of collaborating with ``enemies of the organization.'' \\nThe government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin Laden's \\nactivities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such informant, \\nwho it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden, transporting weapons \\nand explosives, helping to buy land for his training camps and assisting \\nin running his finances. While the June indictment against bin Laden \\nsuggested that the government had a great deal of knowledge of his \\ndealings in the months before the embassy attacks, the new charges \\nare an indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve \\nthe embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago. Ms. White \\nsaid bin Laden was charged with ``plotting and carrying out the most \\nheinous acts of international terrorism and murder.'' Citing the more \\nthan 250 people killed in the embassy attacks and the more than 1,000 \\nwounded, she added, ``In a greater sense, all of the citizens of the \\nworld are also victims whenever and wherever the cruel and cowardly \\nacts of international terrorism strike.'' The investigation of bin \\nLaden is continuing, said Ms. White and Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant \\ndirector of the FBI in New York, whose agents have fanned out around \\nthe world to look into the embassy attacks. ``Our investigative strategy \\nis clear,'' Schiliro said. ``We will identify, locate and prosecute \\nall those responsible, right up the line, from those who constructed \\nand delivered the bombs to those who paid for them and ordered it \\ndone.'' \\n\\nPolice and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a \\nhouse where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled \\nthe bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people. Wearing \\ngloves and masks, detectives from the Tanzanian Criminal Investigation \\nDivision could be seen searching the yard of the house that is surrounded \\nby a high fence. Residents, who were questioned Thursday by Tanzanian \\npolice and FBI agents, told reporters Friday there were four regular \\nvisitors to the house. They all came at night and used a white 1989 \\nSuzuki Samuri, which is in police custody. Two men, Tanzanian Rashid \\nSaleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, have been formally \\ncharged by a Tanzanian magistrate in the Aug. 7 embassy bombing. Police \\nare looking for two other suspects identified Ahmad Khalfan, a Tanzanian \\nof Omani origin and Fahad, a Kenyan of Yemeni origin. A relative of \\nHemed told The Associated Press the house in the Bungoni neighborhood \\nof Ilala district had been rented by Ahmad Khalfan. The house is south \\nof the center of Dar es Salaam and about 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) \\nsouthwest of the embassy building. The relative, who spoke on condition \\nof anonymity, said in addition to Khalfan, the three other visitors \\nto the house were Fahad, Ahmed and Hussein. He did not furnish second \\nnames for them, and it was not clear whether Ahmed was the same Egyptian \\ncharged in the Dar es Salaam bombing. Residents said police showed \\nthem photographs, but they were not able to identify them because \\nit was always dark when they arrived and left. But all were able to \\nidentify the Suzuki vehicle. Officials believe a 1987 Nissan Atlas \\nrefrigerator truck actually carried the bomb into the embassy compound. \\nIt has been identified by its chassis, all that remains. There has \\nbeen speculation that two men in the Suzuiki used a remote control \\ndevice to detonate the bomb. A nearly simultaneous attack in neighboring \\nKenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy \\nin Nairobi. U.S. authorities have charged four people in connection \\nwith the Nairobi blast. Three are in custody in New York, and a fourth \\nis a fugitive. Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody \\nin the United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan \\nwhere he was arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad \\nKhalfan was a member of the group responsible for the bombing in Dar \\nes Salaam. According to the same Pakistani police sources, Odeh identified \\nFahad as being involved in the Nairobi embassy bombing. \\n\\nA federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review complaints by lawyers \\nfor three men arrested after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in \\nAfrica that their jail conditions in Manhattan are unconstitutional \\nand inhumane. Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan \\nsaid he had received an eight-page letter from lawyers for two of \\nthree defendants in custody in Manhattan. The lawyers complained that \\ntheir clients were being held in total isolation for almost 24 hours \\na day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding area \\nin the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. The defendants \\nare allowed only brief periods of exercise in a barren room, called \\nthe rat cage, a defense lawyer, Michael Young, wrote in the letter. \\nA second lawyer, Leonard Joy, concurred with the views in the letter, \\nwhich was made public Tuesday. In agreeing to review the conditions, \\nSand said, ``Certainly it has to be addressed, that is, the condition \\nof confinement for all of the defendants.'' The judge made his comments \\nin the first hearing in the bombing case since last week's indictment \\nby a federal grand jury of Osama bin Laden, who the authorities believe \\nwas the mastermind of the embassy attacks. Bin Laden remains at large \\nand is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of \\nthe Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that rules that country. \\nIn discussing conditions at the Manhattan jail, the lawyers said that \\ntwo of the defendants have not been able to call their families, while \\nthe third has been allowed to make only one phone call. The lawyers \\nadded that the defendants cannot have visitors, write letters, or \\nreceive mail or books. The skirmishing continued in court. ``I cannot \\ngive my client a dictionary,'' a third lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, who \\nrepresents Wadih el Hage, told the judge. El Hage has been charged \\nwith conspiring to kill Americans abroad and has been described by \\nthe government as a former personal secretary to bin Laden. The two \\nother defendants in court Tuesday _ Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed \\nRashed Daoud al-'Owhali _ have each been charged with separate counts \\nof murder in the deaths of more than 200 people in the embassy attacks \\nin Kenya and Tanzania on August 7. All three men have pleaded not \\nguilty. Patrick Fitzgerald, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge \\nthat the government would have a response by Friday, and his comments \\nsuggested that the government will be prepared to make some modifications \\nin the restrictions. \\n\\nThe Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday \\nof looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his \\nwar-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man \\nWashington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of \\nU.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an \\ninterview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States \\nretaliated by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps \\nin eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According to U.S. intelligence \\nsources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's \\nal Qaeda terrorist group. ``America is looking for an excuse to fire \\nmore rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' \\nSaqib said. Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for \\nbin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan. \\nSaqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to \\ninvestigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United \\nStates has become insecure. ``America fears its shadow ... in every \\npart of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to \\nbin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. \\nIn Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban \\nhosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demands the host guarantee \\nhis guest protection. So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin \\nLaden's involvement in terrorist activities. The Taliban have refused \\nto turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there \\nis evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent \\nof Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice \\nhas been imposed, including the death penalty. ``We want good relations \\nwith the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, but \\nthey have to respect our ways,'' he said. Saqib said his inquiry will \\nwind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the \\ncase will be closed _ at least for the Taliban. ``Bin Laden is not \\na sinful man ... America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' \\nhe said. ``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that \\nworld to have no reason to go after bin Laden.'' \\n\\nNAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives \\nof the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously \\ninjured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern \\nDistrict of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday. The blast at \\nthe embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of \\nthem Americans, and injured 5,400. In an nearly simultaneous bombing \\nof the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people \\nwere killed and 85 were injured, none of them Americans. The official, \\nwho could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed \\nat gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the \\npre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection \\nwith the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed \\nDaoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the \\nSouthern District of New York. All three have pleaded innocent. Fazul \\nAbdullah Mohammed is a fugitive. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the \\nalleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the \\nworld, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's \\nterrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page \\nindictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings. Bin Laden is \\nbelieved to be living in Afghanistan. U.S. law provides for the trial \\nin the United States of those charged in terror attacks against American \\ncitizens, even if carried out on foreign soil. \\n\\nThe man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania \\nand Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he \\nhas lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban \\nmilitia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, \\non Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama \\nbin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States. ``It's \\nover, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's \\nchief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an \\ninterview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. \\n``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. ... He is \\na free man.'' The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political \\nactivity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban \\ninformation minister said in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir \\nKhan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich \\nman, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, \\na claim not immediately corroborated. \\n\\nThe New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since \\nthe deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in August, \\nthere has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State \\nDepartment inexplicably ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks \\nagainst the installations. The latest and most disturbing account \\nsuggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department \\nreceived a detailed description of the planned attack but did little \\nto strengthen security at the embassy. The pattern of negligence demands \\nexamination by the Clinton administration and Congress. Shortly after \\nthe bombing, the department acknowledged that the American ambassador \\nin Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that the embassy \\nbe moved to a safer location. Her advice was rejected. On Friday, \\nRaymond Bonner and James Risen of The New York Times reported that \\nan Egyptian now believed to have been directly involved in the bombings \\noutlined the Kenya plot to American intelligence officials last November. \\nMustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific _ he said terrorists \\nwere planning to detonate a truck bomb in the embassy's underground \\ngarage _ that it called for more than a temporary increase in security. \\nUnhappily, it was discounted, even thought to be a ruse to lure the \\nembassy into new security measures that terrorists could monitor and \\ndefeat. The logic of this is hard to fathom, and harder still to explain \\nto relatives of the Americans and Kenyans killed in an attack nearly \\nidentical to the plan Ahmed described. Since the bombings, the department \\nhas been quick to close embassies temporarily if attacks seem imminent. \\nIt would be interesting to know if the intelligence behind those decisions \\nwas any more credible than Ahmed's warning. No one at the State Department \\nis happy with the department's handling of security matters, but the \\ntendency to blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening. \\nOf course, additional money would have made it possible to harden \\ndefenses at more embassies, and Congress has now added to the security \\nbudget. But more decisive leadership in the department could have \\nassured preventive steps were taken in East Africa. \\n\\nGerman police raided several locations near Bonn after receiving word \\nof a terrorist threat against the U.S. Embassy, but no evidence of \\na planned attack was found, officials said Wednesday. Police, including \\nagents of an elite anti-terrorist unit, checked several suspects during \\nraids in an industrial zone and other sites Tuesday, but no arrests \\nwere made, said Eva Schuebel, spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's \\nOffice in Karlsruhe. The agency said it had received ``credible information'' \\nthat Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at \\nthe sites, but none were found. The agency's investigation is continuing, \\nSchuebel said. ``For now, we can no longer speak of an immediate threat \\nto the U.S. Embassy,'' she said. The embassy had no comment. Security \\nwas tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the Aug. 7 bombings \\nof the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saudi dissident Osama \\nBin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks. A suspected \\ntop aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is jailed in Germany \\npending a U.S. extradition request, raising concern about reprisals \\non German soil. U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train \\nand arm members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged \\nbombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In September, \\nGerman police stepped up security at the U.S. consulate in Hamburg \\nafter receiving a tip about a possible threat. \\n\\nFederal prison officials have cut off virtually all communications \\nfor two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies \\nin Kenya and Tanzania. A federal prison official said Monday that \\nthe government moved under a rarely used federal rule that allows \\nprison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts \\nof violence and terrorism.'' A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's \\noffice declined to say whether the authorities foresaw further threats \\nof terrorism. But the law allows officials to impose restrictions \\nwhere they believe there is ``a substantial risk'' that an inmate's \\ncommunications ``could result in death or serious bodily injury.'' \\nUnder the provision, approved by the Justice Department, prison officials \\nmay segregate prisoners from other inmates, and cut off their correspondence, \\nvisits, interviews with the news media and use of the telephone. It \\nwas not clear yesterday which of these restrictions would be applied \\nto the two bombing suspects, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed \\nDaoud al-'Owhali. The rule does permit communications with their lawyers. \\nA Bureau of Prisons official in Washington confirmed that the two \\nmen are joining a group of about six inmates throughout the country \\nbeing held under the restrictions. The total population of federal \\nprisons exceeds 108,000 inmates. Others similarly restricted include \\nSheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric convicted in the conspiracy \\nto blow up landmarks in New York, and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, convicted \\nof masterminding the World Trade Center bombings in 1993. Michael \\nA. Young, the lawyer representing Odeh, said he was ``somewhat concerned \\nbecause these are pretrial defendants, after all.'' ``You can't punish \\nthem in advance of any determination of whether they are guilty or \\ninnocent,'' he said. Leonard F. Joy, al-'Owhali's lawyer, said his \\ninitial impression is that some of the restrictions could hinder his \\nability to represent his client. \\n\", \"\\nThe radical Islamic group Hamas on Monday denounced U.S. President \\nBill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip but carefully avoided \\nmaking any threats against him. Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs \\n\\nBenjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which \\nhas frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians, \\nmay not be enough to save his government from collapse next week. \\nNetanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day \\nvisit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier _ that \\nhe would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday, as stipulated \\nby the Wye River peace accord. Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs \\n\\nLess than a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to arrive for \\na visit meant to bolster a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the \\ntwo sides exchanged angry accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements \\nand street clashes. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, \\nwarned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements \\nin the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish \\na state. ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance \\nare open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in \\nthe West Bank town of Ramallah. Since the signing of a land-for-security \\naccord, Jewish settlers have accelerated the establishment of makeshift \\ncommunities on West Bank hilltops, in an explicit bid to keep the \\nland from being turned over to the Palestinians. Meanwhile, at a meeting \\nof the Israeli Cabinet, ministers expressed dismay over an outbreak \\nof street clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops \\nin the West Bank. ``The Palestinians have been asked to immediately \\nstop the violence and incitement to violence,'' the Cabinet said in \\na statement. At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday in a confrontation \\noutside the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank. \\nDemonstrators threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with rubber \\nbullets and tear gas. A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli \\nsoldiers were injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank. \\nAnd three days before that, Israelis were horrified by television \\nfootage of an Israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten \\nwith chunks of concrete by a Palestinian mob. Israel says Yasser Arafat's \\nPalestinian Authority is orchestrating the street fighting. The Palestinians \\ndeny that. The past week's protests grew out of an increasingly bitter \\ndispute over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel last month \\nfreed 250 of 750 prisoners it is to release under the Wye accords, \\nbut most were criminals. The Palestinians are demanding that so-called \\nsecurity prisoners _ those being held for anti-Israel activity _ be \\nreleased instead. Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the \\nscheduled meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian \\nparliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit. At \\nthe gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance are to \\nreaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national charter that \\ncall for Israel's destruction. Israel has demanded that the Palestinians \\nhold an actual vote at the meeting rather than simply proclaiming \\nthe charter changed, but the Palestinians on Sunday repeated their \\nobjections to that. ``They haven't the right to give us instructions,'' \\nArafat said Sunday as he returned to Gaza following a trip to Europe. \\nClinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands, which is to begin \\nSaturday, is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords \\nand encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for compliance. But \\nsome commentators suggested the visit was proving a polarizing force \\ninstead. ``He is coming to promote the peace process... but his visit's \\nonly actual result is a sharpening of the differences,'' Yosef Lapid \\nwrote in Sunday's editions of the Maariv newspaper. In Israel, increasing \\nconcern is being voiced over Clinton's planned visit to Gaza, the \\nfirst ever by a sitting U.S. president. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet \\nmeeting, a shouting match broke out over the issue, according to Israel \\nradio. ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan \\nShalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu. Netanyahu \\nsaid it had been Clinton's idea, not his. The United States has repeatedly \\nsaid the visit is not intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood, \\nbut the Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty \\nhopes. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said on Israeli television that the \\ninvitation for a Clinton visit came from Israel and was ``warmly welcomed'' \\nby the Palestinians. \\n\\nPresident Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian \\nleaders, the White House said Friday. He is to speak at what the Palestinians \\nare describing as a historic meeting to formally revoke anti-Israel \\nclauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. Israel demanded revocation \\nof the clauses at U.S.-brokered negotiations last month that led to \\nthe latest land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. \\nAs part of that settlement, reached at Wye, Md., Clinton agreed to \\ntravel to territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority to speak \\nat the meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the de facto parliament. \\nAccording to a schedule released Friday by the White House, Clinton \\nwill visit Gaza, the West Bank and Israel during a four-day trip that \\nwill begin on Dec. 12. He is to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin \\nNetanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, before \\nreturning to Washington on Dec. 15. Clinton administration officials \\nsaid the White House had not yet decided whether Clinton would fly \\nto the newly opened Gaza International Airport aboard Air Force One, \\ngiven the symbolism of the president's jet landing on Palestinian \\nsoil with the trappings of a state visit. Officials said the White \\nHouse was fearful of upsetting Israeli leaders who are worried that \\nthe president's planned visit to Gaza appears to be a step toward \\nAmerican recognition of a Palestinian state. The White House said \\nthe president would ``speak to the Israeli and Palestinian people \\nabout the importance of the Wye agreement and the need to continue \\nto support the Middle East peace process.'' The meeting in Gaza on \\nDec. 14 is bound to be contentious, given that many prominent Palestinians \\nhave charged that the Wye agreement allows the Israeli government \\nto backtrack on promises made to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace \\nsettlement. The Palestinians have insisted that they have already \\nrevoked clauses in the 1964 charter that called for Israel's destruction. \\nIn January, Arafat wrote to the White House, listing the anti-Israel \\nprovisions that he said had been annulled. But the letter did not \\nsatisfy the Israelis. And during the talks in Maryland last month, \\nArafat agreed to call a meeting of the national council to ``reaffirm'' \\nthe decision to revoke the clauses. In order to guarantee passage \\nof a motion to annul the provisions, Arafat is being allowed under \\nan agreement with the Israelis and the United States to pack the council \\nmeeting in Gaza with his loyalists, and to conduct the vote by a show \\nof hands instead of a ballot. During a recent interview with Israeli \\ntelevision, Clinton brushed aside concerns that his visit to Gaza \\nmight be seen as a step toward U.S. recognition of a Palestinian state. \\n``That is not what I'm doing in going there,'' he said. ``I have tried \\nstrictly to adhere to the position of the United States that we would \\nnot take a position on any final status issue.'' He said he was traveling \\nto Gaza at the recommendation of, among others, Netanyahu. ``The prime \\nminister wanted me to go there and wanted us all to make this pitch,'' \\nhe said, adding that he would ask the Palestinian National Council \\n``to support the peace and to renounce the idea of animosity toward \\nand opposition to the existence of the state of Israel, and instead \\nembrace the path not only of peace but of cooperation.'' \\n\\nArmored personnel carriers were deployed Tuesday around the convention \\ncenter where U.S. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian \\ndelegates next week. U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived \\nin Gaza to work with their Palestinian counterparts on how to protect \\nClinton during his first visit to Palestinian areas. ``There is cooperation \\nwith the American security people. We have our own plan. The Americans \\nhave their own procedures as well,'' said the Palestinian police chief, \\nGhazi Jabali. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which hopes to scuttle \\nthe accord, has been careful not to openly threaten Clinton. However, \\nHamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel \\nin an attempt to bring peace talks with Israel to a halt. On Monday, \\nClinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to address members \\nof the Palestine National Council and delegates from other groups, \\nat the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City. Traffic near the Shawa \\nCenter still flowed normally Tuesday, but plainclothes security as \\nwell as uniformed officers with M-17 and AK-47 assault rifles began \\npatrolling in the vicinity. Streets around the center are to be closed \\ndays before the Clinton visit. Four armored personnel were parked \\nat the corners of the convention center, with members of Arafat's \\nelite bodyguard unit, known as Force 17, sitting on the vehicles. \\nAPCs were also deployed outside Arafat's guest house and near the \\nPalestinian legislative council. Jabali said the APCs were part of \\na Palestinian security plan that has been presented to the Americans. \\nU.S. security agents, in turn, have given their Palestinian counterparts \\nsophisticated explosives detection equipment. ``The Palestinian police \\nare ready to protect President Clinton here in Gaza or in Bethlehem,'' \\nJabali said, referring to Clinton's expected visit next Tuesday to \\nthe Church of the Nativity in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem \\nIn Jerusalem, Clinton's entourage of 1,200 people will take over the \\nJerusalem Hilton, at a cost of half a million dollars. The hotel boasts \\nstunning views of Jerusalem's walled Old City and the slopes of the \\nJudean Desert. \\n\\nKeeping a promise to Israel and the United States, Palestinian leader \\nYasser Arafat on Thursday convened senior officials and legislators \\nto revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's \\ndestruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, \\nsaid he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots \\nwith a ``firm hand.'' He added that he would not go ahead with a West \\nBank troop pullback, as promised under the Wye River peace agreement, \\nunless Arafat met a list of demands. The West Bank has been swept \\nby stone-throwing protests in recent days, and thousands of Palestinians \\nmarched Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone \\nmason, Jihad Iyad, who was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier. \\nThe violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit \\nto the region, which is to start late Saturday, is fomenting more \\nunrest rather than calming the already tense situation. Israeli hard-liners, \\nincluding Cabinet ministers, have said Clinton's visit is conferring \\nstatehood status on the Palestinian areas. On Thursday, signs reading \\n``Clinton go home'' were strung along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway \\nand on walls in Jerusalem. The most problematic moment of the Clinton \\nvisit will be his address Monday to the Palestine National Council, \\nthe Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, \\nin Gaza City. Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during \\nthis session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of \\nthe PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked. \\nIsrael insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the Palestinians \\nsay only approval by acclamation is required. Netanyahu said Thursday \\nhe will not settle for anything less than a vote, even if Clinton \\ndeclares the PNC session a success without it. ``It is Israel which \\ndetermines issues connected with its future,'' Netanyahu said when \\nasked by Israel radio whether he would be ready to enter a showdown \\nwith Clinton over the issue. It is unlikely the U.S. president would \\nside with Israel in such a dispute because it would mean that the \\nmain purpose of his visit, to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, \\nhad failed. Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer \\nfive percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint jurisdiction. \\nNetanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what he \\nclaimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace accord. \\nHe reiterated Thursday that he would not change his decision unless \\nArafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally declare a Palestinian \\nstate in May. The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing \\nexcuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces \\na very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down \\nthe government in the event of another troop withdrawal. The Palestinians, \\nmeanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the accord. On Thursday, \\n98 members of the 124-member Palestinian Central Council met at Arafat's \\nseaside headquarters to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat \\nletter concerning the PLO charter. The meeting is an interim step, \\nahead of Monday's PNC session, and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. \\nA simple majority of 63 members is required, and a vote was expected \\nby Thursday evening. The council has not met for years and was revived \\nspecifically for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegates, members \\nof the Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee, \\namong others. \\n\\nIsrael affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troops in the West \\nBank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body holds a vote \\nto annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction. \\nJust a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also \\nrejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, \\nan issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank. The Palestinians \\nhave said they would revoke the clauses only by acclamation, not by \\na vote, when the Palestine National Council meets on Monday in Clinton's \\npresence. With its demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown \\nwith Clinton whose visit to Israel and the Palestinian is ushering \\nin the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement he \\nhelped negotiate. Under the accord, the annulment of the offending \\nprovisions by the PNC is to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback. \\nClinton is unlikely to declare the PNC has not completed its task \\nbecause that would mean his high-profile visit has been a failure. \\nHowever, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand for \\na vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli government \\nspokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will not turn over \\nadditional West Bank territory to the Palestinians because ``transfer \\nof territory is irreversible.'' In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department \\nspokesman James Foley was evasive on whether the United States expected \\na vote from the PNC. ``The procedures need to be clear enough that \\nnullification has taken place,'' he said. A senior Palestinian official, \\nspeaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States has not \\nasked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote. \\nOn Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a smaller \\nleadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central Council, declared \\nthe charter clauses revoked. The 95 members present were asked whether \\nthey approved a letter in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter \\nclauses calling for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, \\n81 voted in favor, seven against and seven abstained. Asked about \\nthe decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a very important \\nand constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader also said he hoped \\nClinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep its obligations under \\nthe Wye agreement. The Palestine Liberation Organization charter was \\ndrawn up three decades ago, long before Israel and the Palestinians \\nstarted their peace process in 1993. The Palestinians say they took \\nall the required steps to revoke the pertinent clauses at a PNC session \\nin Gaza in 1996. However, Netanyahu has said the PNC never completed \\nthe job. During the Wye River talks, the Palestinians agreed in a \\ncompromise to invite PNC members and delegates from other groups to \\nGaza to hear Clinton and Arafat speak. The Wye accord says delegates \\nshould ``reaffirm'' the Arafat letter to Clinton, but does not specifically \\nrefer to a vote. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided \\nwith the Palestinians on Friday. ``They did it once, they did it twice, \\nthey don't have to do it again,'' said Peres, who was prime minister \\nduring the PNC vote in 1996. Israel and the Palestinians have also \\naccused each other of violating other elements of the Wye agreement. \\nA key point of contention has been Israel's pledge to release 750 \\nPalestinian prisoners in three stages by the end of January. The Palestinians \\nhave said Israel broke a promise to release prisoners held for anti-Israeli \\nactivities. Israel said it never made such a pledge, and accused the \\nPalestinian Authority of incitement over the prisoner issue. Palestinian \\nnegotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States offered a compromise, \\na trilateral committee to go over the list of prisoners one by one \\nand determine who will be released. But Israeli Cabinet Secretary \\nDanny Naveh said Friday such a proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel \\nhas not been offered such a compromise and there will not be such \\na compromise,'' Naveh said. On Friday, about 2,000 supporters of the \\nIslamic militant Hamas movement marched through the West Bank town \\nof Nablus to press for the release or prisoners. ``We want prisoners, \\nnot Clinton,'' the crowd chanted. At Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's \\nthird holiest site, the prayer leader, Yousef Abu Sneineh, spoke out \\nsharply against the U.S.-brokered peace agreement. ``America supports \\na peace agreement that further reinforces the Israeli occupation of \\nthe Palestinian lands,'' he said. \\n\\nOn a street newly littered with the debris of battle _ stones, spent \\ntear gas canisters, charred remnants of half-burned tires _ a sodden \\nPalestinian flag flaps in a fitful rain-laden wind outside a house \\nin mourning. Inside, to the tinny recorded wail of Koranic verses, \\nneighbors and relatives of the dead man _ a 21-year-old university \\nstudent felled on the roof of his own home by an Israeli soldier's \\nrubber-coated bullet _ sipped tiny cups of coffee left unsweetened \\nto symbolize the bitter occasion. Some smoked, a few spoke quietly \\namong themselves, but most simply sat in reflective silence. Among \\nthose in attendance on this day, the first of the traditional three \\ndays of family mourning, was Saeb Erekat, the chief peace negotiator \\nfor Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, \\nwas a cousin of his. Erekat stayed for a time, sitting amid clan elders \\nin Arab headdresses and teen-age nephews in American-style athletic \\nshoes, then slipped away for a meeting in connection with President \\nClinton's visit beginning this weekend. ``It's been very difficult,'' \\nhe said later, asked about carrying on his negotiating duties at such \\na time. ``I have a great sense of sorrow and sadness, a feeling of \\nsuch loss. I hope God will enable me to use my grief to strengthen \\nmy determination for peace.'' The scene at the Erekat home, in the \\nArab village of Abu Dis on Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drives home \\na central truth about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: on both sides \\nof the divide, the political is also deeply personal. And that inescapability \\ngoes to the heart of the quarrel's intractability. In the glare of \\nworld attention, it is easy to forget that there are fewer people \\nliving in Israel and the Palestinian lands combined than there are \\nin New York City. In the small and jostling confines of what few here \\nchoose to call the Holy Land, the conflict touches all. Everyone has \\na stake in it. Israelis fret daily over soldier sons on dangerous \\npatrol in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pass \\na sidewalk cafe once ripped by an Islamic militant's suicide bomb. \\nPalestinian families struggle to keep alive the memories of fathers \\nand brothers languishing in Israeli prisons, and chafe under the checkpoints \\nand gunsights of Israeli troops. On both sides, the youngest soak \\nup fear and anger along with their ABCs. And elders' memories of half \\na century past still rise to trouble the collective sleep: the shadow \\nof the Holocaust for Israelis, the trauma of exile and dispossession \\nfor the Palestinians. Against this backdrop, amid a landscape little \\nchanged since biblical times, terrible Old Testament themes _ lamentation \\nand retribution, the smiting of enemies and the sharpening of swords \\n_ spring to life once again in any day's headlines. Now comes Clinton, \\nthis most American of presidents, one who has made Middle East peacemaking \\na kind of personal crusade, in hopes of halting what has become one \\nof the century's most protracted blood feuds. Clinton is no stranger \\nto these particular hatreds. Three years ago, in another winter season, \\nhe came here to bury Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, gunned down by \\na nationalist Jew who could not abide the terms of a Mideast agreement \\nthat called _ just as this latest accord does _ for Israel to cede \\nWest Bank land in exchange for peace with the Palestinians. On the \\noccasion of this visit _ first intended to celebrate the Wye River \\naccords signed seven weeks ago in Washington, now meant to salvage \\nthem _ all three of the principals are embattled. Clinton is under \\nan impeachment cloud; Arafat is buffeted by furious Palestinian street \\nprotests and his own failing health, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's \\ncoalition government is hanging by a thread. The days leading up to \\nClinton's visit have been divisive ones, contriving somehow to simultaneously \\ntap into both sides' greatest fears. In the West Bank's worst spasm \\nof violence in months, Israelis watched windows of Israeli-plated \\ncars shatter from stones thrown by angry youths, saw TV footage of \\na cringing Israeli soldier _ now facing court martial _ being beaten \\nbloody by a Palestinian mob, heard Palestinian officials' exhortations \\nfor a new intefadeh, or uprising. Palestinians, for their part, listened \\nin anger as Netanyahu announced the suspension of an upcoming Israeli \\ntroop pullback in the West Bank and tried vainly to halt Israeli bulldozers \\nexpanding Jewish settlements on land they claim as their own. Both \\nsides _ to Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay _ came \\nto see the visit as an implicit acknowledgement of Palestinian statehood \\naspirations, despite increasingly desperate American efforts to avoid \\ncasting it in that light. Clinton's foray to the Gaza Strip, which \\nis already under Palestinian rule, will be the first by a sitting \\nAmerican president. Palestinians intend to play on that symbolism \\nfor all it is worth, greeting him with the strains of their once-banned \\nnational anthem. In the mourning house in Abu Dis, though, the friends \\nand relatives of Nasr Erekat had little to say about politics and \\nstatehood. They talked about Nasr instead. Amr Erekat, 27, recalled \\nhis disbelief as he cradled his dying cousin in his arms. His 14-year-old \\nbrother Taher spoke haltingly of the big brother he had looked up \\nto. His childhood friend, Samir Abdel Salam, remembered wishing he \\nhad stuck to his studies as diligently as Nasr had. Saeb Erekat, the \\npeace negotiator, could find neither lesson nor logic to his young \\ncousin's death. ``It's senseless, this rhythm of bloodshed,'' he said. \\n``At these difficult times, you pray for one thing, for both sides: \\nno more of it.'' \\n\\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat \\nof ``making a farce'' of the Wye River accords and said he would not \\nagree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence. \\nNetanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the Palestinians \\nwere emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood \\nbecause they believed they had the Clinton administration ``in their \\nback pocket.'' ``The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye \\nRiver accord. They think they have the United States in their back \\npocket,'' said the Israeli leader. ``As long as that is the case, \\nthey will not change their behavior.'' Netanyahu said he did not believe \\nthe United States was siding with the Palestinians, but his sharply \\nworded remarks sent a strong signal that he would like President Bill \\nClinton to intervene and lower Palestinian expectations prior to his \\nDec. 12-15 trip. Palestinians claim it is Israel that has violated \\nthe summit agreement reached in October by not freeing jailed political \\nactivists, by confiscating West Bank land for roads and allowing Jewish \\nsettlers to seize hilltops for expansion. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of \\nthe Palestinian Legislative Council and the head of the peace team \\nthat negotiated the Oslo accords, told reporters Sunday ``all means \\nof resistance'' was justified in opposing settler activity. Netanyahu, \\nwho rejected claims of settlement expansion as ``bunk,'' was interviewed \\nin the Cabinet room after a meeting of his unruly coalition government, \\nwhich rallied behind Netanyahu on his tough stance. But officials \\nsaid Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him for being too generous \\nto the Palestinians by agreeing to the Clinton visit next week to \\nGaza and the West Bank. ``We are not going to give up territory when \\nthere are violations of the agreement and attempts to get things that \\nweren't achieved at Wye using violence,'' Netanyahu said. Israel has \\nthreatened to scrap the next Israeli troop pullback, which is scheduled \\nfor Dec. 18, three days after Clinton's departure. The United States \\nhas said it should go ahead as scheduled. Palestinians see the Clinton \\ntrip as implicit recognition of their struggle for statehood, even \\nthough Clinton has specifically said in an interview aired on Israel's \\nChannel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Netanyahu \\nmade clear that he would be annoyed if Air Force One landed at the \\nnewly opened Palestinian airport in Gaza, which aides said would be \\nviewed as a strong symbol of support for Palestinian demands for sovereignty. \\n``We will be very disappointed if that is the case. We've said to \\nthe United States that we don't think that is necessary,'' Netanyahu \\nsaid of reports that Clinton's plane would land in Gaza. He said traveling \\nby motorcade would be quicker and more politically considerate. ``Unless \\nsomebody wants to put a thumb in our eye, I think there are better \\nways to travel,'' Netanyahu said. In the interview, Netanyahu stressed \\nthat he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat stop \\nthreatening to declare independence on May 4, 1999, when the Palestinians \\nmaintain the Oslo accords expire. ``What must be is that Yasser Arafat \\nretracts this open and incipient violation of the Oslo and Wye River \\naccords and recommits himself to negotiating until we get white smoke, \\nuntil we get a solution. That's the only way we'll get a real peace \\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said. In a conciliatory \\nspeech in Sweden over the weekend, Arafat stressed that he sought \\na negotiated settlement and did not mention May 4 as a deadline. He \\nalso said any Palestinian state would not make alliances with states \\nhostile to Israel _ one of Netanyahu's key concerns. The Israeli leader \\nis also demanding that Arafat drop claims that Netanyahu promised \\nat Wye to release 750 Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attacks \\nthat resulted in bloodshed, rather than freeing car thieves and petty \\ncriminals. Each side has a different interpretation of the understanding \\nregarding the prisoners. Netanyahu maintains he never agreed to free \\nthose with ``blood on their hands.'' ``It's high time that Yasser \\nArafat admits this was agreed upon and that he's not going to make \\ndemands on Israel, including the incitement of violence,...on a trumped-up \\ncharge, '' he said. ``Israel never promised to release murders at \\nWye, and it won't release them.'' The issue has been the focal point \\nfor a new wave of violent protests and demonstrations in the West \\nBank and a hunger strike that began Saturday by the 1,700 Palestinian \\ninmates. Israel is also upset by statements that the nearly 600-member \\nPalestinian National Council will not reaffirm in a vote that anti-Israel \\nclauses in the Palestinian charter have been deleted. Netanyahu maintained \\nthat only 25 members out of hundreds who live abroad had been invited \\nso far. Netanyahu quoted Clinton as telling him that the purpose of \\nhis visit was to ``personally make sure that they actually rescind \\nthis charter that calls for Israel's destruction.'' \\n\\nIn an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. President Clinton met \\nSunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to \\nput the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track. After getting \\ntogether for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite, the two leaders met \\nat Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to reporters later. The \\npresident was sure to be asked about the impeachment drama unfolding \\nin Washington. At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, \\nNetanyahu said he hoped the president's visit would ``contribute to \\ntrue peace.'' Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of \\nignoring commitments in peace accords. Clinton is to meet with Palestinian \\nleader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. Thousands of police \\nwere deployed throughout Israel during the Clinton visit. At the hotel \\nwhere Clinton is staying, 500 policemen were posted to guard the president \\nand his 600-member delegation. Clinton's wife, Hillary, and their \\ndaughter, Chelsea, set out on their own schedule. Mrs. Clinton toured \\na school in a cooperative village of Jews and Palestinians, while \\nChelsea visited Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. \\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporters during a picture-taking \\nsession with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Israel ``has \\nnot left'' the Wye River agreement. ``We will not give up'' on the \\nland-for-security accord, Sharon said. But, he added, ``it should \\nbe based on mutual reciprocity.'' About two hours before Air Force \\nOne landed Saturday night, the House Judiciary Committee approved \\na fourth article of impeachment against Clinton. The full House will \\nvote on the impeachment articles next week. Israeli government spokesman \\nMoshe Fogel was asked Sunday if the success of Clinton's visit would \\nturn on the question of revoking the Palestinian Liberation Organization's \\nfounding charter. ``President Clinton played a very important role \\nin the Wye Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's going \\nto be very, very important that this visit show us at least a readiness \\non the part of the Palestinian Authority to move forward in peace,'' \\nFogel said. There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone \\nthrowers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school student \\nwas stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager. In his remarks \\nat Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night, Netanyahu said the peace \\nprocess is in danger. ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking \\nin Hebrew, ``The truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians \\nagain constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their \\ncommitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to forgo \\nfulfillment of those commitments.'' Netanyahu, who is facing political \\nturmoil in his hard-line coalition government, said he could not accept \\n``a phony peace on paper'' which is ``not honored in practice.'' Since \\nClinton presided over its signing in Washington in October, the land-for-security \\nagreement has hit one snag after another. Israel froze implementation \\nof the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of violating the deal and \\ninciting violent street protests. Clinton said the United States shares \\nIsrael's concerns about security. ``Peace is not simply an option \\namong many but the only choice that can avert still more years of \\nbloodshed, apprehension and sorrow,'' he said. ``That is why I'm here.'' \\nHe said ``both sides now must face the challenge of implementing Wye.'' \\nBoth Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The Israeli \\nleader is fighting for his political survival as parliament prepares \\nfor a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition began to \\nweaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum Oct. 23 \\nagreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to be met \\nby Palestinian security measures. Netanyahu has said there would be \\nno further troop withdrawals until West Bank rioting and violence \\nends. Israel and the Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement \\nover procedures for revoking passages in the Palestinian charter calling \\nfor Israel's destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoners \\nheld in Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the Jewish \\nstate. On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza \\nStrip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit. \\nClinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National \\nCouncil is seen by some as a boost for dreams of Palestinian statehood. \\n``It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state,'' Ziyad \\nAbu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council, said in \\nan interview Sunday. \\n\", \"\\nJames Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material witness in the \\nsniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to abortion rights \\nleaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement \\nofficials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations \\nat abortion clinics. The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police \\nrecords, studies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper \\naccounts of protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an \\nitinerant protester, moving about the country in a series of increasingly \\nabrasive protests at abortion clinics. Federal law enforcement officials \\nsay he is not currently a suspect in the Slepian shooting, and there \\nwas no indication Wednesday that he had been arrested for any violent \\nacts. At several abortion protests, he was charged with trespassing \\nor resisting arrest, according to news accounts. One of his arrests \\nwas in Atlanta during Operation Rescue's huge anti-abortion protests \\nthere in 1988. While he was in an Atlanta jail, Kopp was given the \\nnickname Atomic Dog, which investigators contend links him to the \\nviolent fringe of the anti-abortion movement, responsible for a series \\nof bombings and arsons and seven murders of abortion providers like \\nSlepian over the last five years. Responsibility for some of the violence \\n_ like the bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., earlier \\nthis year, in which an off-duty policeman was killed _ has been claimed \\nin notes signed by a shadowy ``Army of God.'' An underground manual \\nissued in the name of the Army of God, which describes methods for \\nattacking abortion clinics, including how to make homemade C-4 plastic \\nexplosives, begins with a tribute, by nickname, of a clandestine band \\npledged to stop abortions. The first name under this ``Special Thanks'' \\nsection is Atomic Dog. The Atlanta police, after searching the hundreds \\nof arrest records of the protesters from the summer of 1988, confirmed \\nWednesday night that the date of birth and Social Security number \\nof the James Kopp arrested then matched those given out Wednesday \\nby the FBI task force in Buffalo investigating the murder of Slepian, \\nwho was gunned down through the window if his home in suburban Amherst \\non Oct. 23. At the nondescript frame house in St. Albans, Vt., that \\nthe FBI gave as Kopp's last known address, the current resident, who \\ngave his name only as E. Kenny, 20, a shipping clerk, remembered Kopp \\nwell. He lived there for part of 1990 as the guest of Kenny's parents, \\nwho were active in the anti-abortion movement, among a group of protesters \\nwho tried to shut down two abortion clinics in Burlington in stubborn \\ndemonstrations that year. Kenny remembered Kopp as a ``really nice \\nguy,'' who did chores around the place but paid no rent to the parents. \\nHe sometimes made wooden toys or played video games with Kenny, then \\na child. ``But the focus of his life was the anti-abortion movement,'' \\nKenny recalled. ``He was known among these people as Atomic Dog. It \\nwasn't like a name that he had to go to the store or something. But \\nif you knew anything about him, that's what you called him.'' Roughly \\n95 people were arrested during the protests, according to newspaper \\naccounts at the time. ``There were many, many arrests,'' recalled \\nAllie Stickney, the president of Planned Parenthood of Northern New \\nEngland. ``It was very big for Vermont. There were Kryptonite locks \\nand leaflets from the Army of God and the Lambs of Christ. It was \\nclearly a highly organized blockade.'' According to newspaper accounts, \\nKopp was arrested outside a clinic in Levittown, Long Island, in 1991. \\nThe protests in Atlanta in 1998 appeared to be a turning point for \\na hard-core group of protesters. The Atlanta police cracked down hard \\nand carted hundreds of demonstrators off to an isolated prison dormitory \\nthe called ``the farm.'' Operation Rescue had mounted a series of \\nblockades to close down abortion clinics in New York and Philadelphia \\nthat spring. Atlanta was their high point, but in the face of the \\ntough arrest policy, the movement faltered, split apart and stalled. \\n``It was a traumatic, life-changing experience,'' said Frederick Clarkson, \\nauthor of ``Eternal Hostility,'' a book on the anti-abortion movement, \\nadding that by 1993 with the shooting of Dr. David Gunn, an abortion \\nprovider in Florida, some of those in the Atlanta jail became the \\nnucleus of a group signing a ``justifiable homicide'' statement that \\ndeclared that the use of force was warranted to ``defend the life \\nof an unborn child.'' \\n\\nIn the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician \\nin upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week \\nthat she was setting up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility \\nthat the doctor was the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot. The \\nunit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include a dozen \\nJustice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies. \\nBut the main work of looking into the shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian \\nin his suburban Buffalo home and how it fits a larger pattern of organized \\nviolence will be done by the FBI, which has jurisdiction over domestic \\nterrorism. For many in the FBI, that's a problem. In contrast to the \\nold image of gung-ho FBI agents turning their surveillance machinery \\non political groups, a number of senior FBI agents privately expressed \\nmisgivings about the attorney general's latest task force, the second \\nshe has ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving \\nanti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation \\ncould drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separates \\ninquiries into criminal activity from those into political causes \\nand unpopular ideas. Today's agents are eager to disassociate themselves \\nfrom the old J. Edgar Hoover days of trampling the civil rights of \\npolitical dissidents in the guise of serious investigations. They \\ndo not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological \\nwar between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who \\nhave long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against \\nclinics and doctors. Many of those calling for government help were \\nonce themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil rights \\nactivists. Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, \\nwere starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay \\nas the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro, the counterintelligence \\nprogram that allowed agents to spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate \\nanti-war and civil rights groups like Students for a Democratic Society \\nand the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials \\nare dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors who perform abortions. \\nThey came up empty handed when Reno ordered the first federal inquiry \\nin 1994 after the killing of a Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The \\nJustice Department conducted a two-year grand jury investigation; \\nagents pursued some anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. \\nBut investigators never found a specific plot against abortion clinics \\nand staff members. Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the \\nproblem. The FBI has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield \\nof politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of anti-government \\nmilitias, environmental and Christian extremists, white separatists, \\nanimal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists. ``The FBI is \\nvery quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political \\nassociation,'' said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\n``When you move from investigating crimes to investigating groups, \\nthat all-important nexus to criminal conduct gets lost, the focus \\ngets broader and broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful \\npolitical activity.'' In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings \\nof the World Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building \\nin 1995 and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency has increased \\nefforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program. In \\nsuch cases, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law enforcement \\nagencies said they operate under domestic security guidelines that \\nrequire investigators to find a ``reasonable indication'' that a group \\nis planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into \\nan organization. Before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics \\nas wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence. \\nYet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat \\nposed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local \\nauthorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups. \\nTheir conclusion is that most of these groups pose little real danger. \\nMuch more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed by \\nthe oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group, drifting \\nalong society's frayed margins, ``off the grid,'' as some agents describe \\nit, without the usual ties to family, friends or work. The profile \\nfits Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for bombings at the \\nAtlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics. He has \\nkept his beliefs mostly to himself, although acquaintances hint that \\nhe was familiar with religious extremism and hate groups. In contrast, \\nJames Charles Kopp, who is being sought as a material witness in the \\nkilling of Slepian, left a trail of clues about his motives. He was \\nan early follower of Randall Terry, a leader of Operation Rescue. \\nLater, Kopp was associated with the Lambs of Christ, an another militant \\nanti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said that the government \\nshould do what it does best. ``We should investigate violations,'' \\nhe said. ``We shouldn't investigate groups.'' \\n\\nWhile veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday \\nto honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day has become a chilling \\nvigil for Canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement. \\nThere is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is believed \\nto be at large. And there is long-term anxiety, because even in this \\ncountry where abortions are legal and publicly funded, women may find \\naccess diminishing. There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked \\nto Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day \\nto commemorate aborted fetuses. Three times since 1994, a sniper has \\nused this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor \\nwho performs abortion, each time wounding the target. The attacks \\nwere spread across Canada _ Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. \\nU.S. and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked \\nto two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York, \\nincluding the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home near \\nBuffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted \\nfor questioning about the shootings. Police say they don't know which \\nside of the border he is on, fueling uneasiness at clinics and hospitals \\nthroughout Canada. ``You must realize Canada has the largest undefended \\nborder in the world,'' said Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in \\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation. Many women's \\nclinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions \\nhave been urged to take precautions. ``I would suggest they be extremely \\naware of their day-to-day goings on, whether during their business \\nday or after hours,'' said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across \\nCanada, there have been reports of obstetrician-gynecologists modifying \\ntheir practices or deciding to stop performing abortions. Some wear \\nbulletproof vests and hang sheets over windows of their homes. Abortion-rights \\ngroups say most doctors are not backing down. ``There's a great deal \\nof sadness,'' said Susan Fox, director of a clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, \\nthat provides abortions. ``But there's also a feeling of determination \\nthat we won't be deterred or scared by these actions.'' Marilyn Wilson, \\nexecutive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, \\nsees a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young \\ndoctors from entering the field. ``There are almost no doctors who \\nhave stopped performing these procedures, even under the current reign \\nof terror,'' she said. ``But young doctors with families wouldn't \\nnecessarily want to do this. They may not be willing to put their \\nlives at risk.'' The abortion debate is only one of several factors \\ncontributing to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Canada. \\nThe national society that oversees the speciality says there are about \\n1,400 doctors in the field, a shortfall of 600, and most are in their \\n50s or 60s. The society says long hours and limits on fees paid by \\nthe public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical \\nschool graduates as they choose a specialty. Another problem is that \\nfew Canadian medical schools offer training in abortion. Women in \\nCanada's big cities generally have adequate access to abortions. Those \\nin rural areas often face long journeys, and the province of Prince \\nEdward Island prohibits abortions at its six hospitals, forcing women \\nthere to travel to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups \\nsay the situation would improve if the RU-486 abortion pill were available \\nin Canada. No drug company has applied for permission to market the \\npill, either fearing boycotts or doubting its profitability. The government \\nhas been urged to make a public appeal to drug companies, but the \\nhealth department says this can't be done. ``It would be a conflict \\nof interest,'' said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, a department spokeswoman. \\n``As a regulator we have to stay at arm's length, so we can judge \\nan application impartially.'' Abortion was illegal in Canada until \\n1988. Now there is no abortion law of any sort, about 100,000 abortions \\nare performed annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters \\nof Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support doesn't \\nspare doctors from fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led efforts to \\noverturn the old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic was bombed \\nin 1993, says he and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom \\nas they reluctantly increase security measures. ``Unfortunately, doctors \\nwho are committed to providing these services will have to accept \\na certain diminishment of their enjoyment of life,'' he said. \\n\\nEveryone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that the slight, graying \\nphysician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break, \\nmost people. There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage \\ncans at his home and growled ``murderer'' as they passed him in the \\ngrocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients \\nas they arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby \\nkiller. Outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a \\nweek, pickets shouted epithets like ``pig'' to his face. Slepian, \\nan obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor \\nby principle, rarely acknowledged the strain. He might crack an occasional \\njoke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and \\non weekends. Then he would do something unexpected, like invite an \\nanti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar \\ndemonstrator outside the clinic. So when he was killed Oct. 23 by \\na sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in \\nthe Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern \\nof four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western New York \\nstate and Canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that \\nSlepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. He had predicted \\nas much himself. Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted \\nin that work, long after other Buffalo doctors had surrendered to \\nthe pressure of abortion opponents. ``He was an incredibly fatalistic \\nperson who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is \\nnothing you can do about it,'' said H. Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old \\nniece. ``And he was incredibly stubborn. He said that women had a \\nright to comprehensive health care and since he was a women's doctor, \\nhe was going to provide it for them.'' Slepian is the third doctor \\nto be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings that \\nhave killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the \\nnation. To his tormentors, he was simply an abortion doctor. To members \\nof the abortion rights movement, he was a martyr for their cause. \\nBut Slepian was far from either. In interviews with friends and family \\nmembers, he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract _ a conservative \\nwho advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance, a shy man who \\nhad rare flashes of anger, a doctor who performed abortions but had \\nno more patience for women who had multiple abortions than for women \\nwho had multiple children they did not want or could not support. \\nHe was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has become \\nemotional and politicized. Yet there is nothing in his life to suggest \\nhe was a crusader in either politics or medicine. Rather, he was an \\nobstinate, unassuming man who did a remarkable thing. Out of contrariness \\nand out of conscience, say those who knew him, he refused to allow \\nanyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be, and for that, \\nhe paid with his life. The clues to Slepian's flinty brand of commitment \\nlie, in part, in his upbringing. His was a family that took success \\nfor granted even as it teetered on the edge of poverty. To earn money \\nfor medical school, he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi. \\nHe made few friends, but those he had were friends for life. When \\ntheir wives were sick, he called repeatedly. When they were lonely, \\nhe flew to their side. Slepian, who was known as Bart, used to tell \\npeople that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes \\na doctor to the least suffering, and that he performed abortions because \\nit was legal and the alternatives were so much worse. Slepian often \\nexpressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after \\nabortion. ``Don't they get it?'' his clinic staff recall him saying \\nmore than once. He had the same impatience for women like those he \\nremembered from his residency in inner-city Buffalo, who had child \\nafter child and no means of support. ``He had the contempt for that \\nof somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it \\nin the world,'' Ms. Robb said. He believed that to ban abortions or, \\njust as shameful in his view, to stop teaching young doctors how to \\nperform them, would not correct the human imperfections that he found \\nso irritating. ``There are 1.5 million abortions performed in this \\ncountry,'' his niece said, ``and he just felt we're not equipped to \\nhandle 1.5 million unwanted children.'' When he was killed, at the \\nage of 52, Bart Slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet \\nsuburb of Amherst, complete with a swimming pool with piped-in music \\nand an assortment of the time-saving gadgets he adored. Slepian's \\ntrajectory to that comfortable doctor's life had been unconventional. \\nHis grandfather, a Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling \\nshoelaces from a pushcart in Boston, propelled all five of his sons \\ninto Harvard at a time when few Jews met the university's blue-blood \\nstandards. His father, in turn, decreed that his own three sons would \\nbe doctors or earn Ph.D's. ``We grew up in a home where there was \\ntremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect for education,'' said Serena \\nRobb, Slepian's sister, who is four years older than him. ``If you \\ngot an A, it was OK If you got a B, you got yelled at.'' The family's \\nmeans did not match its expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, had \\njoined his own father's business manufacturing leather soles for shoes. \\nSoon after Bart was born in 1946 in Boston, the company failed, so \\nto save money, the father moved his family of six to his in-laws' \\napartment in McKeesport, Pa., and then to Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, \\nSlepian's father set himself up as a freelance writer, crisscrossing \\nthe country in his old Studebaker, researching the origins of prominent \\ncitizens at the Library of Congress and writing their stories for \\nsmall-town newspapers. He sold articles by the hundreds, and was still \\nwriting until his death nine years ago at the age of 93. The success \\nthat was expected of Bart Slepian did not come easily. As a child, \\nhe was so shy that he cried when anyone looked at him, his sister \\nrecalled. An unexceptional student, he went to a local community college \\nbefore transferring to the University of Denver, where he majored \\nin zoology. Rejected by medical schools in the United States _ the \\nfate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied \\none year in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University \\nfor Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember him as funny \\nand obstinate, a thin young man with glasses and a receding hairline \\nwho beat all comers at arm-wrestling and pool. ``Bart had certain \\nbeliefs, strongly held,'' said Richard Schwarz, an old classmate who \\nis an internist on Long Island. ``He always said you shouldn't sit \\naround whining about things,'' Schwarz said. ``He would say, `Go after \\nwhat's yours and what's right.''' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced \\nin quirky ways. He once insisted on going to the top of the World \\nTrade Center, despite a crippling fear of heights. To get to the window, \\nhe crawled, inch by inch. ``I said, `You don't have to do this,' '' \\nrecalled Schwarz, who was with him at the time. ``And he said, `I \\nwant to do it.' Bart made it count. He felt alive.'' Forced to drop \\nout of school every few semesters to work, he lived in Reno with his \\nsister Serena, a widow who was struggling to take care of two young \\ndaughters. She worked as a waitress and a blackjack dealer, sharing \\nher tips with him while he drove a cab, cleaned barns at a ranch and \\nworked as a laboratory assistant at the local Veterans Administration \\nhospital. After graduation, he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency. \\nThere he married Lynne Breitbart, a registered nurse 10 years his \\njunior, and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice \\nfrom a doctor who was about to retire. He had a soothing, unhurried \\nmanner. When a patient of his, Patti Durlak, was diagnosed with diabetes, \\nSlepian referred her to a specialist but called every few days for \\nmonths to help her overcome a fear of the needles she had to use for \\nher insulin injections. ``The other doctor said, `Just deal with it,''' \\nMrs. Durlak recalled. ``Not Dr. Slepian.'' In most ways, he was a \\ntypical suburban family man, working six days a week and spending \\nhis free time at Little League games and county fairs with his four \\nsons. But by the late 1980s, he and other abortion doctors in Buffalo \\nwere under siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape, \\nthe Rev. Paul Schenck, one of the fieriest of Buffalo's anti-abortion \\nleaders, threw himself in front of the doctor's car as he pulled into \\nthe clinic driveway. Slepian parked on the street. As he pushed his \\nway through the crowd of chanting demonstrators, Schenck cupped his \\nhands around his mouth and lunged, shouting, ``Slepian, you pig!'' \\nSlepian's attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private \\nlife were futile. The protests followed him home and the man who had \\nbeen so bashful as a boy found himself, uncomfortably, at the center \\nof controversy and attention. Once, he showed his anger. In 1988, \\nwhen demonstrators jeered at him from the sidewalk in front of his \\nhome as he opened Hanukkah presents with his children, the doctor \\ncame out brandishing a baseball bat. He denied he hurt anyone, but \\na town judge ordered him to repair one protester's smashed van window \\nand pay a portion of another's medical bills. The outburst surprised \\nhis family and friends. It was not Slepian's style to make a public \\nfuss, much less acknowledge the stress of being taunted by protesters. \\n``Stress?'' his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked about \\nthe doctor's mood. ``I never heard the word used in my family, except \\nas an engineering term. He said it was a nuisance.'' Mrs. Slepian \\ndid not respond to requests for an interview. She expressed rage to \\nThe Buffalo News shortly after the shooting. She said that whoever \\nhad killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would \\nbe happy to administer the lethal injection herself. She also spoke \\nout after Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader \\nwho frequently confronted Slepian, sent a bouquet of flowers. Mrs. \\nSlepian denounced him as ``a hypocrite.'' After the confrontation \\nin 1988, Slepian turned to civil harassment lawsuits, letters and \\nlevity to deal with the protesters. In 1993, when a man active in \\nthe anti-abortion effort was arrested for rifling through the doctor's \\ngarbage cans at home, Slepian tried to treat the incident lightly. \\n``They hopefully got the bags full of dirty diapers,'' he joked. He \\ntried to engage his critics through the local newspaper. He told The \\nBuffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies to \\nhelping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and \\ncounseling. In a letter to the editor he warned that by repeatedly \\ncalling him a murderer, his critics were inciting violence. Slepian \\naccepted that opponents of abortion acted out of moral conviction, \\nhis friends said, but resented the personal attacks. ``He thought \\nit tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger,'' \\nsaid his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took a step that \\nfew of the nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared. He \\ninsisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut through the venom. \\nTo the dismay of the staff members who feared for his safety, Slepian \\nbegan about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he recognized \\noutside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo, where he worked \\ntwo days a week. He surprised a gathering of protesters who were preparing \\nfor what they euphemistically called a ``house call,'' or demonstration \\nat the doctor's home, and invited the protest's organizer, the Rev. \\nRobert Behn, to breakfast. Their hourlong conversation the next morning \\nwas inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture as an ``attempt \\nto get people to like him.'' He asked Slepian how performing abortions \\naffected him spiritually. In response, he recalled, the doctor said, \\n``I'm fine spiritually.'' Slepian, meanwhile, focused more on time \\naway from home with his family. He planned to take a cruise next spring. \\nHe bought a time-share apartment near Disney World in Florida. ``He \\nhad so many plans,'' said Ellen Fink, a close friend of the couple \\nfor 15 years. ``He wasn't done. He wasn't done living yet.'' Still, \\nsometimes during the most casual conversations, a shadow would appear. \\nWhen his wife gave him a gray African parrot for a birthday gift, \\nSlepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he would \\nteach it his eulogy. ``He would talk about the funeral he wanted,'' \\nMrs. Fink said. ``He said he didn't have a lot of friends and wanted \\nall of them to come in separate cars, one in each car, so he'd have \\na long procession.'' In the week before his death, Slepian had reasons \\nto be preoccupied with thoughts of mortality. A medical checkup had \\nrevealed a blockage of his heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting a conversation \\nwith Mrs. Slepian the day of the slaying. A blockage is a sign of \\nprobable coronary artery disease. He was to have more tests the following \\nweek. ``I said, `Lynne, just relax, it's going to be OK,''' Mrs. Fink \\nrecalled. That same day, the National Abortion Federation sent a fax \\nto the Womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attacks \\non abortion doctors that occurred in early November. Marilynne Buckham, \\nthe clinic director, sent it to Slepian. ``He definitely took it seriously,'' \\nshe recalled. Typically, the doctor did not share any concerns he \\nmight have felt. ``It was a normal day,'' said Tammi Latini, his office \\nassistant. ``We were horsing around.' That evening, the Slepians went \\nto synagogue to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Slepian's \\nfather. Shortly after they returned home, a sniper's bullet smashed \\nthrough the kitchen window, killing Slepian as he chatted with his \\nwife and sons. The protesters returned to the clinic five days later, \\nthe first day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, the director, said Slepian \\nwould not have been surprised. They have their routine. So did he. \\n``He never wanted a day to end on a bad note,'' she said. ``At the \\nend of the day, I would always say, `Thank you for coming.' And he \\nwould always turn with a stupid grin and say, `Thanks for having me.''' \\n\\nFederal authorities investigating the murder of a Buffalo-area obstetrician \\nwho performed abortions have identified a Vermont man as a material \\nwitness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his \\narrest Wednesday to bring him in for questioning. The man was identified \\nas James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address was in St. Albans, \\nVt. His whereabouts are not known, investigators said. Investigators \\nsaid Kopp's car was seen near the Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett \\nSlepian in the weeks before the doctor, whose work at an abortion \\nclinic had long made him a target of harassment, was killed. Kopp, \\naccording to police records and abortion rights groups, has often \\nmoved about the country in a series of protests at abortion clinics, \\nand has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods \\nof killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions. Denise O'Donnell, \\nthe U.S. attorney for the western district of New York, said Kopp \\nwas not considered a suspect at this time but was believed to have \\ninformation material to the case. She declined to give details on \\nwhat evidence was being sought from Kopp, describing it only as information \\nthat is contained in a sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise \\nthe ongoing investigation. Ms. O'Donnell said that federal law allowed \\nfor an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person has information \\nthat is important to a case. ``If Kopp is found, he would be arrested, \\nbrought to Buffalo and ordered to provide the required evidence,'' \\nMs. O'Donnell said. ``Then, most likely, the individual would be released.'' \\nSlepian, 52, was shot by a sniper firing from outside his home on \\nOct. 23, shortly after returning from an evening service at his synagogue. \\nHe was standing in his kitchen with his wife and one of his four sons \\nwhen the bullet crashed through a back window. He died two hours later. \\nLaw enforcement officials said Wednesday's announcement of the material \\nwitness warrant was in part an attempt to underscore the potential \\ndanger of anti-abortion violence in advance of Remembrance Day, a \\nCanadian holiday that falls on Nov. 11 and that the authorities have \\nassociated with some anti-abortion crimes. At the same time, the Justice \\nDepartment and the FBI were trying to find ways to step up the federal \\nresponse to violence at abortion clinics in the aftermath of the Slepian \\nkilling. The officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno would \\nsoon announce that the Justice Department, aiming to heighten the \\nvisibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local \\njurisdictional boundaries, would revive a national investigative effort \\nfocused on abortion clinic violence. Ms. Reno and senior FBI officials, \\nincluding Robert Bryant, the deputy FBI director, have met with physician \\nand abortion rights groups in recent days to discuss ways to enhance \\nfederal investigative efforts and coordination with local agencies. \\nFederal authorities first organized an abortion clinic task force \\nin 1995 after the killing of a Florida doctor. The unit, which was \\ncharged with investigating whether a national conspiracy existed, \\nspent nearly two years studying abortion clinic violence. The unit \\ndisbanded without uncovering a national conspiracy. Law enforcement \\nofficials said that the unit's operation did help reduce violence \\nat abortion clinics and that, in part, the decision to re-establish \\nit was prompted by Ms. Reno's desire to send a renewed message to \\nanti-abortion extremists that the government would aggressively investigate \\nthese crimes. Slepian's murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper \\nattacks on abortion doctors in Canada and western New York, dating \\nfrom 1994. None of the attacks have been solved. Bernard Tolbert, \\nspecial agent in charge of the FBI in Buffalo, said at a news conference \\nhere Wednesday that investigators had not determined whether there \\nis a link between the five killings. ``There's a possibility they \\ncould be linked, but certainly no information,'' he said. Tolbert \\ngave little information about the subject of the material-witness \\nwarrant, except to say that Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier, \\nwith the Vermont license plate BPE216, was seen near Slepian's home \\nbeginning several weeks before the murder. ``We don't have any idea \\nof where he is,'' Tolbert said of Kopp. ``We are looking for him every \\nplace we can, every place he might be.'' A photograph of Kopp taken \\nin January 1997 has been distributed to law enforcement agencies around \\nthe United States and Canada. The National Abortion Federation has \\nsent out an advisory to clinics around the country about the search \\nfor Kopp, said Melinda DuBois, assistant director of Womenservices, \\nthe clinic where Slepian worked. She said naming Kopp a material witness \\nin the case had not brought relief to the nurses and other workers \\nat the clinic. ``I don't think it makes me or anyone else at the clinic \\nfeel differently,'' she said. ``I don't want anybody to relax and \\nsay, `Oh God, they got the guy.' That's easy to happen. I still want \\npeople to be very vigilant.'' The clinic is the last in the Buffalo \\narea that is performing abortions. Slepian was one of only a handful \\nof doctors in Buffalo who were still willing to perform the procedure \\nin the face of pickets, protesters and threats. Since his death, doctors \\nfrom outside Buffalo have come to the clinic to continue providing \\nabortion services. \\n\\nIn July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the night from his \\nhome in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion \\nprotests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation \\nRescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp was in the \\nvan riding alongside him, according to former leaders of Operation \\nRescue who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And, those people \\nsay, when Terry was arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's \\n``Siege of Atlanta,'' Kopp followed him into jail. Along with more \\nthan one hundred other Operation Rescue members, according to some \\npeople who were there, Kopp remained in jail for 40 days and adhered \\nto Terry's orders not to give a real name to the police or courts. \\nAfter his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's Binghamton \\nheadquarters, and was there working alongside Terry as the group's \\npower and influence in the anti-abortion movement surged in late 1988 \\nand 1989, according to the former leaders of Operation Rescue. Now, \\nKopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement authorities \\nfor questioning as a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician \\nwho performed abortions in the Buffalo region. The authorities also \\nsay he may have information that will help solve four other sniper \\nattacks on doctors who performed abortions in Canada and upstate New \\nYork. Some abortion-rights groups are seizing on Kopp's role in Operation \\nRescue to raise new questions about the connections between the recent \\nanti-abortion violence and the hard-line anti-abortion protest groups \\nthat burst onto the national scene in the late 1980s. For years, the \\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department have looked \\nin vain for evidence to determine whether a national conspiracy might \\nbe behind a series of clinic bombings and shootings of doctors and \\nother clinic staff members that began in the early 1990s. A federal \\ngrand jury in Alexandria, Va., that looked into conspiracy allegations \\nwas ultimately disbanded without finding a national underground. But \\nsome federal law enforcement officials say they hope that Kopp may \\nhelp provide such a link. In fact, the announcement that law enforcement \\nofficials are looking for him has been made as Attorney General Janet \\nReno has prepared to revive an interagency task force to look once \\nagain for possible conspiracies behind anti-abortion crimes. Federal \\nlaw enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp is not now \\na suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that killed Dr. Barnett \\nA. Slepian near Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car was seen near Slepian's \\nhome in Amherst, N.Y. in the weeks before the doctor was shot. One \\nday after issuing a warrant for Kopp's arrest as a material witness, \\nlaw enforcement officials from at least 10 agencies spanning the United \\nStates and Canadian border still had not located Kopp Thursday. But \\nlaw enforcement officials said they were pursuing many tips, including \\nabout 400 that have poured into the FBI's information line: (800) \\n281-1184. The police have gone through photographs of abortion protesters \\nand clinic workers in Buffalo and around the country, and they are \\nalso reviewing hundreds of hours of videotapes of demonstrations in \\nsearch of Kopp's face. At this point, officials consider the shooting \\nof Slepian to be connected to three attacks in Canada and one in Rochester \\non doctors who provide abortions. The five attacks, all since 1994, \\noccurred in the weeks leading up to Nov. 11, Veterans Day _ called \\nRemembrance Day in Canada _ a holiday that has become important to \\nanti-abortion activists. But the attacks were spread over four years \\nand 3,000 miles, from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Buffalo. As \\nis the case with many early veterans of Operation Rescue, Kopp was \\ntransformed into a hard-core anti-abortion militant in jail in Atlanta \\nin 1988, according to many people who were in jail with him who insisted \\non anonymity. \\n\\nRosina Lotempio was standing outside abortion clinics here before \\nOperation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy Spring of \\nLife rallies, in which hundreds were arrested. She was there before \\nLambs of Christ demonstrators came to town in 1993. She was on the \\nsidewalk outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices the morning of Oct. 23, \\nabout 12 hours before Barnett Slepian, the clinic doctor, was fatally \\nshot in his home. And she was there Friday, brown rosary beads in \\nher hands, a small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietly \\npraying for abortions to stop. ``I'm heartbroken when I have to come \\nhere,'' Mrs. Lotempio, 58, said as she stood in the cold, wearing \\nsmall black earmuffs and a white turtleneck adorned with a tiny silver \\npin of baby feet. ``It's very difficult out here; I depend on God,'' \\nshe said, after praying for several moments to decide whether to talk \\nto a reporter. The bombings, the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponents \\nand the posters of bloody fetuses may capture the attention of the \\nnews media, but people like Mrs. Lotempio are the foot soldiers in \\nthe abortion battle. They call themselves street counselors and come \\nto the clinic whenever they believe abortions are being performed. \\nThey pray and they talk to women, hoping to change their minds. Some \\nscream profanities. Others, like Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only \\nthe violence against doctors and clinics, but also the blocking of \\ndoors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and patients. \\nFor the approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest is \\nmore like a job than a political activity. There is a schedule. People \\ncount on them to show up. Mrs. Lotempio, a mother of three and grandmother \\nof six, connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in \\nwhich she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy. Two \\ndecades later, she was haunted by her own question: whether the fetus \\nwas male or female. ``I just felt horrible and I felt guilty,'' she \\nsaid, tears in her eyes. ``I thought that if I was at the clinic doing \\nsomething, I could make up for that baby's life.'' During Mrs. Lotempio's \\n8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift Friday, about a dozen people circled the area \\nin front of the Buffalo clinic, saying the ``Hail Mary.'' Others take \\nher spot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. She returns on Saturdays, when \\nup to 40 people crowd the sidewalk. Similar bands of protesters march \\nin front of abortion clinics throughout the United States, and local \\nprotesters are often joined by bands of people who roam the country. \\nAt the clinic on Main Street, north of downtown Buffalo, there is \\nan odd sense of community. Local protesters greet Dick, the security \\nguard, by name. They sometimes see the ``enemy'' _ abortion-rights \\nvolunteers who escort patients in and out of the clinic _ in the supermarket \\nor on the soccer field. Robert Behn, one of the protest leaders, even \\nspent two hours talking about abortion over breakfast last year with \\nSlepian. And several said they cried when they heard of Slepian's \\ndeath. Most of the protesters, including Mrs. Lotempio, were among \\nthe thousands of people arrested here in 1992, the height of anti-abortion \\nactivity in Buffalo. But if Operation Rescue returns, as planned, \\nfor a Spring of Life reunion in April, Mrs. Lotempio said, she will \\nnot be there. Instead, she plans to stay in church and pray, to avoid \\nthe militancy she says she finds uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, a lawyer \\nfor Womenservices clinic, said: ``When people from out of town show \\nup, that is when we feel the most danger. The local people are a known \\nquantity. We know most of the local people by name.'' Buffalo has \\nbeen among a handful of hot spots for abortion protesters for the \\nlast decade. It is a heavily Catholic city where thousands of protesters \\nfrom around the country demonstrated for two weeks in 1992. They failed \\nto close abortion clinics, but 500 people were arrested in rallies \\nthat snarled traffic and drew national headlines. Those rallies, as \\nwell as earlier protests and continuing sidewalk vigils, have had \\nan impact, people on both sides of the abortion issue say. The number \\nof clinics performing abortions in the Buffalo area has dropped to \\none from three. And after Slepian's death and the retirement this \\nweek of another doctor, there are only two doctors in the area for \\nwhom abortions form a significant part of their practices. The daily \\ndemonstrators count this as progress. But their perch outside the \\nclinic means they witness far more of what they believe are murders \\nthan what they call rescues. About 30 women a day might go into the \\nclinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio can count eight women who \\nchanged their minds and did not get abortions while she was at the \\nclinic. Inside the clinic, the protests just make a hard job harder, \\nmany clinic workers say. While some demonstrators simply repeat the \\nrosary, other protesters call out to patients as they drive into the \\nparking lot behind the building, or walk up to the fortresslike front. \\nThey ask questions like ``Do you know what your baby looks like?'' \\nor ``Is it a boy or a girl?'' Sometimes they accuse people of murder \\nand torture and sin, or threaten them with damnation. Federal law \\nbars protesters from coming within 15 feet of the clinic entrances, \\nand from leaning signs against its walls. Some push the limits, frustrating \\nclinic workers and guards. The rules protect people from physical \\nharassment, but because of the distance, they turn what could be quiet \\nconversations into catcalls and taunts. When a patient goes into the \\nclinic, the protesters ``take on a different persona,'' said Melinda \\nDuBois, director of the Buffalo clinic. ``They scream and yell and \\ncall us names. They lie. Some days we're immune to it, but other days \\nit's just too much.'' Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, \\nsaid she identified with the clinic patients. When she was 23, she \\nsaid, she struggled with the difficulties of being unmarried and pregnant \\nherself, but decided to have her child, and married the father. She \\nbegan protesting in 1990, after attending an abortion protest march \\nin Albany. \\n\\nOn the eve of a holiday that has been linked to antiabortion violence, \\nthe authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether a picture of \\nan aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper was connected to last \\nmonth's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provided abortions \\nor four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994. \\nThe newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, has received five \\nsimilar packages in the last year, some containing veiled threats \\nand several delivered by a man who employees said resembled James \\nCharles Kopp, who is wanted for questioning as a witness about the \\nOct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Five days after the shooting, \\nthe Spectator received a package containing an antiabortion flier \\nwith biographical information about Slepian, including a photograph \\nof him that had been crossed out. ``It certainly causes us to be more \\ninterested than ever in speaking to Kopp,'' said Inspector Keith McKaskill \\nof the Winnipeg Police Department, a spokesman for the Canada-United \\nStates task force investigating the five shootings. Even as they searched \\nfor Kopp, federal officials were also looking into three letters that \\nwere received Monday by Catholic and antiabortion organizations in \\nBuffalo, Indianapolis and Chicago. Those letters, saying they contained \\nthe deadly anthrax bacteria, came 10 days after eight similar threats \\nto clinics that provide abortions. All the letters appear to be hoaxes, \\nand it remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five \\nshootings. Kopp is not a suspect in the shootings. An itinerant antiabortion \\nactivist whose last known address is in Vermont, he is the subject \\nof warrants on both sides of the border. In Canada, he is suspected \\nof administrative violations of immigration law; in the United States, \\nhe is wanted as a material witness in the Slepian case. \\n\\nThe slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminated \\nthe mainstay of the only abortion clinic here, but it has not eliminated \\nwomen's access to abortion. That is because the availability of abortion \\nin the Buffalo area, as in much of the United States, is a complex \\nreality, one affected by class and education, medical training and \\nthe personal convictions of individual doctors. Knowledgeable middle-class \\nand affluent women here who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy \\ncan usually obtain an abortion from their private gynecologists, or \\nif a gynecologist has a personal objection to the procedure, through \\na referral to a colleague. Women who are poor, young or uneducated \\nand have no such regular relationships with doctors have to rely on \\nspecialized clinics like the one Slepian worked in, or on hospitals. \\nIt is this group _ for whom unplanned pregnancies are far more common \\nthan for prosperous women _ that faces a shrinking universe of possibilities \\nas a result of the fear set off by Slepian's killing and the slayings \\nof five other doctors and clinic workers since 1993, medical experts \\nsaid. ``If you're well off and well connected, you can get your abortion,'' \\nsaid Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director of the center for clinical ethics \\nat the University of Buffalo, which trains doctors for the Buffalo \\narea's hospitals. ``For everybody else, it's less and less available.'' \\nThe number of abortions in the United States has been declining steadily \\nsince the first years after the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision \\nlegalized abortion in 1973, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, \\nwhich studies reproductive issues. They now number roughly 1.5 million \\na year, according to reports by Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according \\nto the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion \\ngroup, which calculates its estimate partly from the Guttmacher figures. \\nThe number of providers who identify themselves as performing abortions \\nas part of their practice is diminishing as well. A 1994 Guttmacher \\nstudy, the last one published, found that the number had decreased \\n18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908. Moreover, the \\nstudy said, only 12 percent of the nation's residency programs routinely \\noffer training in abortions during the first trimester, though many \\ndo offer elective courses. Laura Echevarria, director of media relations \\nfor the National Right to Life Committee, contends, however, that \\nmost teaching hospitals do train gynecologists in procedures for treating \\nmiscarriages that are similar to those used for performing abortions. \\nOnly in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities like New York \\ndoes the availability of abortions continue at a steady level, experts \\nsay, though even in these locales there is concern about the decreasing \\nnumber of young doctors who emerge from residencies fully trained \\nin performing abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, which keeps the \\nnation's most precise statistics, said that in 1992, the last year \\nfor which it has figures, there were 142,410 abortions in New York \\nthat were done by just 151 providers, including 61 hospitals and 44 \\nclinics. Still, that provider figure greatly understates the number \\nof private doctors who perform them in their offices, medical experts \\nsay. ``Many obstetricians and gynecologists in Manhattan provide abortions \\nas part of their palette of services, and have for many years,'' said \\nDr. Richard Hausknecht, the medical director of Planned Parenthood. \\n``Rich and middle-class women have always had access to abortions, \\nand they always will.'' The major threat to availability in the city \\nis less a result of anti-abortion violence than of medical training. \\n``The bottom line is that we're facing an impending shortage of physicians \\nwho are adequately trained and willing to do the procedures,'' said \\nDr. John Choate, chairman of the New York State division of the American \\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But the lack of training \\nprograms is also a result of political pressures on hospitals and \\nuniversities by antagonists of abortion and the same climate of fear. \\n``Physicians tend to lie low,'' Choate said. ``They don't publicize \\nthe fact that they do them. If they do them, they do it quietly out \\nof fear for their practice and for their lives.'' One development \\non the horizon that is expected to change the outlook for abortions \\nsubstantially is final federal approval, expected next year, of the \\nRU-486 pill, the drug that ends an early pregnancy without the need \\nfor surgery. When the pill was introduced in France and in Edinburgh, \\nScotland, Hausknecht said, the number of surgical abortions plummeted. \\n\\nBy outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She and \\nher family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario, \\nand every morning, she gives her husband, John, a peck on the cheek \\nbefore he goes to work. She runs errands, like other suburban moms, \\nand spends much of her day taking care of her children. But one thing \\nsets Mrs. Hayes apart from her neighbors. As a devoted opponent of \\nabortion, the 43-year-old mother of nine regularly plays host to a \\nseries of traveling speakers, priests and protesters _ many of whom \\nhave come to Rochester intent upon spreading the word against abortion \\nand shutting down clinics that provide it. She is one of thousands \\nof people across the country loosely associated with anti-abortion \\ngroups like the Lambs of Christ who have opened their homes to the \\nLambs' founder, the Rev. Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrators. \\nWhile many _ including Mrs. Hayes _ disavow violent tactics, supporters \\nof abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility \\nwhen the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors. \\n``These people who provide Father Weslin with food and shelter when \\nhe comes into town to close the clinics are not innocent,'' said Ann \\nGlazier, the director of clinic defense for the Planned Parenthood \\nFederation. ``It's just not credible to say they aren't part of the \\nextremist activity that is taking place at these clinics. They are \\nstill guilty of interfering with women's access.'' But Mary Quinn, \\na local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who also offers her home \\nto protesters, sees matters in a differing light. ``Taking people \\nin like this is an act of Christian charity,'' Mrs. Quinn said. `People \\nwho travel around the country doing this work are taken in by those \\nof us that who don't want to lose their stupid houses. We take in \\nthese people because they are willing to make the sacrifice.'' Members \\nof the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figures in protests at \\nthe Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked before \\nhe was shot to death last month. Although no suspect has been identified \\nin the shooting or in several similar attacks in New York and Canada \\nover the past several years, officials are looking to question a Vermont \\nman whose car was seen near Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles \\nKopp, has participated in abortion protests for more than a decade, \\nand often was a house guest of other members of the Lambs of Christ. \\nWhile Mrs. Hayes says she would never so much as obstruct a clinic's \\ndoor, some of those to whom she has given refuge have no qualms about \\ndoing so. Weslin, the leader of the Lambs of Christ, is one of those \\nwho has benefited from Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, a modern version of \\nthe generosity that Christ and the Apostles knew well. He prides himself \\non being arrested more than 60 times during protests in front of medical \\nclinics. And throughout the 1980s and early '90s, he was active in \\nclinic ``rescues,'' in which protesters tried physically to restrain \\npatients trying to enter clinics. Weslin stayed at Mrs. Hayes' home \\nonly once, beginning in May 1996 when he first came to speak at local \\nchurches about the anti-abortion movement. But during a stay that \\nlasted several months, he was arrested on Federal charges of blocking \\naccess to a Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed. \\nHe was later convicted and served two and a half months in prison. \\nDuring the protest outside the clinic, he and several other protesters \\nlocked themselves in a homemade contraption called ``the oven,'' made \\nof cement and iron. It took police officers several hours to lug the \\ndevice to a horse trailer that carted it off. At the same protest, \\none man glued his head to a lock on a gate surrounding the clinic, \\na move some protesters later said was an accident. Abortion opponents \\nlike Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak of attending peaceful observances \\nat abortion clinics and offering prayers for the unborn. They talk \\nabout counseling women about alternatives to abortion at Roman Catholic \\n``pregnancy centers,'' and their support of anti-abortion candidates. \\nBut they also say they saw nothing wrong with Weslin trying to block \\naccess to clinics. They describe the activity as peaceful resistance \\nmeant to stop what they see as murders. Weslin and the other house \\nguests of Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommended from friends \\nand members of local Catholic churches, they said, adding that most \\nare speakers at local churches or anti-abortion events. And although \\nthey say they would never take into their homes a stranger wanted \\nby the FBI, like Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little \\nabout their guests. But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know a \\nlot about Weslin. An Army veteran, he has been a leader of the anti-abortion \\nmovement for more than 25 years, they say, and founded a home for \\nunwed mothers. Mrs. Hayes said that when she met him, it was obvious \\nhe was a man of peace who ``had a tremendous devotion to the Blessed \\nMother and basically recognized that we are helpless lambs.'' Barbara \\nFredericks, another local abortion opponent who developed ties to \\nthe Lambs after Weslin came to town, added that the priest epitomized \\na man of God. ``I just knew when I looked at his holy shoes and his \\nsimple coat that had been mended 50 times,'' she said. ``He was humble, \\na man who was doing this for a higher purpose, trying to save people \\nthrough sacrifice and prayer.'' opp also has robust defenders among \\nthe people who housed him as he rode about the country from protest \\nto protest. E. Kenny, 20, said that his parents housed Kopp in their \\nSt. Albans, Vt., home for two years after he spoke at their local \\nchurch in 1988. During Kopp's stay, he was a pleasure, Kenny said, \\nalways helping around the house. ``He was a nice guy, kind of like \\nan uncle to us,'' Kenny said. ``He'd sit around and play video games \\nwith us and make us model planes out of wood.'' Like Weslin, Kopp \\nwas consumed by a need to fight abortion and often talked about its \\nevils, Kenny said, adding that Kopp was a gentle man who wanted to \\nbecome a Catholic priest. ``He was always in a good mood,'' Kenny \\nsaid. ``He never did anything violent at all.'' Both Kopp and Weslin \\nhave been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests. The men have \\nmoved in the same circles and at times found themselves arrested at \\nthe same events. Mrs. Quinn said that Weslin told her in a recent \\ntelephone conversation that he knew Kopp. Weslin could not be reached \\nfor comment, but it is clear that the two men have encountered each \\nother. Both faced misdemeanor charges after blocking a Burlington, \\nVt., health clinic in 1990 that Kopp called ``the mill.'' And they \\nspent time in the same jail in Atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest. \\nSlepian's death has abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn \\nworried, both about how the killing is being portrayed in the media \\nand what it will do to membership in groups like the Lambs of Christ. \\n``For a long time, you felt like the voice in the desert that wasn't \\nbeing heard,'' Mrs. Hayes said. ``And then there was this horrible \\ntragedy of this doctor's death becoming the face of the movement. \\n``We're about saving lives,'' she said. The FBI has not talked to \\nMrs. Hayes, but Kenny said that agents have spoken to him. The Justice \\nDepartment says that a Federal task force set up this week to investigate \\nthe killing of Slepian is looking for evidence connecting anti-abortion \\nviolence at various clinics. ``It's fair to say that when investigating \\nthese events, we will look at any connection between individuals engaged \\nin criminal conduct,'' Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the department, \\nsaid. Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have \\ntried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian. They are \\nmailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their \\nmovement. In addition, some people associated with the Lambs are offering \\nother possible explanations for the killing. Some say they believe \\nthat the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a \\npersonal experience with abortion. Others wondered whether the shooter \\nhad tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing \\nmore abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents \\nare being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient. \\nOne idea gaining currency among the Lambs, and prominently displayed \\non their Web site, suggests that the killing was the result of a plot \\nby abortion supporters to discredit abortion opponents just before \\nlast week's elections. Mrs. Hayes says she doesn't know the truth. \\n``There are wackos who travel around and they may be in front of the \\nclinic because we are drawn to the same place,'' she said. ``But you \\ndon't know everyone who shows up and you don't turn to the person \\nnext to you and tell them they don't belong there.'' Mrs. Fredericks \\nsaid that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provides abortions was \\nsomeone ``who had snapped, perhaps because of the importance of the \\nsituation.'' Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of \\nabortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder \\ntheir efforts. When Weslin first arrived two years ago, he brought \\nnew focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel \\npregnant women and set up booths on college campuses, they said. ``In \\nmany cities, they have a priest for life coordinating and leading \\nrosary marches'' against abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. ``But with Father \\nWeslin coming here, we could finally come together and feel like we \\nwere doing something sacrificial as a group.'' Mrs. Hayes said that \\nshe felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s, when she \\nheard women speak about ``choice'' in regard to abortion. Then she \\nsaw ``Silent Scream,'' a well-known anti-abortion film that purports \\nto show the footage of an abortion. ``What I saw was the end of life,'' \\nshe said. She began to volunteer at a Catholic pregnancy center where \\nshe encouraged women ``not to kill their child.'' She also began to \\nhouse unwed mothers and went to stand vigil outside local clinics \\nwhere abortions were performed. Mrs. Hayes looked at her 3-month-old \\ndaughter, Bernadette, then pointed to the prenatal image of the infant, \\na sonogram taken at 13 weeks that she keeps on her refrigerator door. \\nShe described what could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone \\nelse's child. ``Two pounds and two inches ago, she could have been \\na partial-birth abortion,'' Mrs. Hayes said, referring to a controversial \\nlate-term abortion procedure. ``They have the hardest time getting \\nthe shoulders out, so they can get to the head and puncture it. ``It's \\nbrutal, but what do you expect when the purpose is a dead baby? There's \\nno question that these doctors are trying to murder a child.'' \\n\", \"\\nBlood and soot-blackened water ran in rivulets from the charred wreckage. \\nA burly policeman bent to cover a bloodied corpse with whatever was \\nat hand _ a sodden piece of cardboard, a plastic shopping bag. Two \\npeople were killed and at least 21 injured when an explosives-rigged \\ncar blew up Friday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, only meters \\n(yards) from the site of a suicide bombing 16 months ago. At police \\nbarricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest thoroughfare, soldiers \\nand police held back crowds of people, some frantic about loved ones \\nwho had been shopping in the crowded market only hours before the \\nstart of the Jewish Sabbath. ``Please, please, is there a girl with \\nred hair who is hurt?'' an older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying \\nto push her way past police. A young female soldier patted her arm \\nconsolingly. Some of the onlookers gave vent to fury over the new \\npeace agreement, which was being debated by Israel's Cabinet even \\nas the blast occurred. ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!'' a small \\ncrowd of demonstrators shouted. Police tried to grab one of them, \\nbut he escaped into the crowd. The explosives-rigged car was a mass \\nof twisted metal, with only the steering column intact. Next to the \\nwreckage lay a completely charred body with stumps of arms and legs \\n_ apparently that of the bomber. Witnesses said they heard a series \\nof explosions. Although shop windows closest to the car were shattered, \\nmarket stalls only a few more feet (yards) away were completely intact, \\nand stacked with neat piles of bananas and onions. Eyewitness Yaakov \\nShlomo said initial, smaller blasts scared most onlookers away. ``When \\nthe big explosion went, there were already not that many people nearby,'' \\nhe said. ``That was a miracle from heaven.'' Shlomo Meir, a black-clad \\nOrthodox Jew, was standing nearby when he heard a blast. When he tuirned \\nhe saw fire. ``It was terrible,'' he said, red-eyed. ``I thought, \\n`Again!''' Only a block away, some stalls were still open and shoppers \\nwere buying produce. One woman, with almost maniacal determination, \\nsorted through a pile of oranges. ``We can't stop what we're doing \\nwhen this happens,'' she said grimly. By the police barricades, wearing \\nbright-orange vests, stood a group of Orthodox Jewish volunteers who \\nsearch scenes of accidents and attacks for body parts, in keeping \\nwith their religious belief that bodies must be buried intact. One \\nyoung volunteer squinted down the street as his group waited for permission \\nto begin its grisly task. ``It's hard, this work, but it's very important \\nto us,'' he said. \\n\\nThe militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War said Saturday that \\nit carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, \\nwhich prompted arrests by the Palestinian Authority overnight. Palestinian \\nofficials said they had jailed several of the small but radical group's \\nmembers from the West Bank, and raided and then shut down a nursery \\nschool linked to the organization in Bethlehem, which is controlled \\nby the Palestinians. The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack, \\nwhich led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security \\naccord signed with the Palestinians last month, were identified as \\nmembers of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli \\nsecurity control. Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, the Damascus-based leader \\nof Islamic Holy War, said ``martyrs'' from his movement had carried \\nout the Jerusalem attack in response to Israel's settlement policy \\nand ``Judaization'' of the West Bank. He spoke in an interview with \\nMonte Carlo Radio, an Arabic station broadcasting from Paris that \\nis widely listened to in the Middle East. A leaflet signed by the \\ngroup and faxed to Reuters in Jerusalem said the ``heroic attack,'' \\nin which 24 people were injured and the 2 bombers killed, had been \\ncarried out ``to confront the great conspiracy that aims to liquidate \\nthe Palestinian cause through the Oslo and Wye Plantation agreements \\nof submission.'' Islamic Holy War and its counterpart, Hamas, have \\ndenounced as a sellout of Palestinian rights the 1993 Oslo self-rule \\naccord and the latest agreement, known as the Wye Memorandum, named \\nfor the Wye Plantation in Maryland, where the deal was worked out \\nwith strenuous American mediation. Shallah's claim of responsibility \\nfrom abroad contrasted with the muted response of Islamic Holy War's \\nleadership in the Gaza Strip, which has reportedly given commitments \\nto the Palestinian Authority to refrain from such attacks. ``We have \\nno knowledge in the movement about the operation that occurred in \\nJerusalem,'' said Nafez Azzam, a senior leader of Islamic Holy War \\nin Gaza. ``From its conditions we consider it likely that it was an \\nindividual effort.'' The Palestinian cabinet, in a statement issued \\nafter a meeting on Friday night, accused ``foreign forces'' of standing \\nbehind the attack. One cabinet member, who declined to be identified, \\npointed a finger at Iran, saying a search of one bomber's home had \\nuncovered a letter he had written to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah \\nAli Khamenei, expressing condolences for the recent killing of several \\nIranian diplomats in Afghanistan. Iran, which has backed militant \\nIslamic groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace efforts, has denounced \\nthe Wye agreement, branding Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, \\na traitor to the Palestinian cause. The Palestinian cabinet promised \\nto crack down on the militants, who it said were jeopardizing the \\nrecovery of Palestinian land and hopes for statehood by giving Israel \\na pretext to postpone carrying out the Wye accord. The Israeli Cabinet \\nsuspended a meeting to ratify the agreement after the bombing, demanding \\nthat the Palestinians conduct an ``all-out war on terror.'' Israeli \\nofficials had no comment Saturday on the measures taken by the Palestinian \\nAuthority on Friday. The Wye agreement calls for an Israeli troop \\nwithdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for specific \\nPalestinian measures against violent militants. A Palestinian security \\nofficial said several Islamic Holy War members were arrested in the \\nWest Bank on Friday night. Arrests were also reported in the Gaza \\nStrip. Itaf Alayan, a supporter of the group who runs the Islamic \\nPurity Nursery in Bethlehem, said Palestinian officers had raided \\nthe school and confiscated videotapes and educational cassettes before \\nlocking it up. The two bombers were identified as Youssef Zughayer, \\n21, from Anata, near Jerusalem, and his brother-in-law, Suleiman Tahayneh, \\n24, from Silat al-Harithiya, near the West Bank town of Jenin. Both \\nhad served time in Israeli jails and were known to be members of Islamic \\nHoly War. ``We never thought he would do something like this,'' said \\nMuhammad Zughayer, Youssef's father. ``We condemn such acts, but the \\nonly thing we can do now is to say may he rest in peace.'' \\n\\nIsrael's Cabinet announced within hours of a market bombing Friday \\nthat it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the \\nWye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism. \\nIsrael radio said the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord \\nwould resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fulfilled \\nall of its commitments under the agreement, including arresting Islamic \\nmilitants. The Cabinet also insisted that Arafat convene the Palestinian \\nNational Council, a parliament in exile, to abrogate the Palestinian \\nNational Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction. The Israeli \\nCabinet had convened for a second day in an attempt to approve the \\nWye agreement. ``To our sorrow, since the Wye agreement ... there \\nhas been relentless terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens,'' \\naccording to a Cabinet statement read on the radio. Israel radio quoted \\nofficials saying the Cabinet would also decide to renew construction \\nof the Har Homa neighborhood in the traditionally Arab sector of Jerusalem. \\nGroundbreaking there in March 1997 led to a break-off in negotiations \\nwith the Palestinians. \\n\\nOn a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the time he usually left \\nfor work at his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer said goodbye \\nto his grandmother for the last time and rode off to his death. Relatives \\nsay that the 21-year-old Palestinian from this village near Jerusalem \\nshowed no sign that he was heading for a suicide mission with his \\nbrother-in-law as part of a secret cell of Islamic Holy War. Their \\ncar-bomb blew apart two hours later in a Jerusalem market, killing \\nboth men and wounding 24 people. ``Don't grieve for me,'' he wrote \\nin a farewell note, according to relatives who found it later. ``If \\nyou cry, cry with happiness that I'm a martyr. Don't serve bitter \\ncoffee, serve sweets. I'm going to Paradise.'' At the family's stone \\nhouse outside Jerusalem on Sunday, visitors paying condolence calls \\nwere served sweet juice, not coffee, as Sughayer's relatives tried \\nto make sense of what he had done. The young man, once an ace student, \\nhad come of age in Israeli prisons. Jailed for a year at age 15 for \\nstoning Israeli cars during the riots of the Palestinian uprising, \\nhe was imprisoned again at 17, that time for three-and-a-half years \\nfor similar offenses and affiliation with Islamic Holy War. Relatives \\nsaid he was an impressionable teen-ager, influenced by Islamic militants \\nwith whom he was jailed. Sughayer came out of prison more devout, \\nand hardened by mistreatment at the hands of the Israelis, relatives \\nsaid. His cellmates taught him the doctrine of holy war and about \\nthe glories of martyrdom, said an older brother, Samih Sughayer. ``They \\nsowed it in his heart,'' he said. ``He wanted to be a martyr in the \\ncause of God.'' But that reality, suddenly so clear Sunday, was not \\nso apparent when Sughayer was freed seven months ago. ``He seemed \\nnormal,'' said his brother. ``He went to work at the grocery store, \\nhe finished his high school classes and he wanted to enroll in the \\nuniversity. He was supposed to take a driving test in a few days. \\nIf he was planning something, we didn't see it.'' He would stay up \\nlate at night after work, studying the Koran and praying, but he showed \\nno outward signs of rage toward Israel. ``He would joke about things \\nand say that whatever happens is God's will,'' said a brother-in-law, \\nwho insisted on anonymity. ``He was an easygoing guy.'' Last Thursday, \\nSughayer bought a battered red Fiat and parked it near his house. \\nWhen someone at home asked about the car he said nothing, and family \\nmembers assumed it was one of the stolen vehicles often found here. \\nOn Friday morning he left with the car, meeting his brother-in-law \\nand old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who came from his village near \\nthe West Bank town of Jenin. Tahayneh had his own score to settle \\nwith the Israelis. His leg had been amputated after he was shot in \\na confrontation with Israeli troops during the uprising, his relatives \\nsaid. The Fiat was loaded with explosives, and the two men drove to \\nthe market. That evening, when concerned members of the Sughayer family \\ngathered to await news of their missing relative, a man arrived and \\ntold them that he had sold his car to Youssef the previous day. It \\nwas a red Fiat, the same car they had seen near the house, and the \\nsame type of car that news reports said had exploded in the marketplace. \\nAt midnight, Israeli security forces raided the house and interrogated \\nfamily members. The last, grim pieces of the puzzle fell into place. \\n``Up to the last minute on Thursday night we were talking together,'' \\nsaid Sughayer's oldest brother, Ali, who worked with him past midnight \\nat the produce store. ``He asked me about someone who had moved his \\nhardware shop to another village, about how he was doing. Earlier \\nwe ate together, and we talked about giving charity to the poor. He \\nwasn't nervous.'' ``He had plans for the future,'' Ali continued. \\n``Maybe the people in his group convinced him to do this, and he could \\nnot refuse. We did not expect this from him.'' \\n\\nIsrael's Cabinet decided Friday to suspend indefinitely its ratification \\nof the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians. The decision \\ncame less than three hours after a car rigged with explosives blew \\nup in an outdoor market in downtown Jersualem. Two people were killed \\nand 21 others were wounded in the attack for which the Islamic militant \\ngroup Hamas claimed responsibility. The Cabinet said it would not \\nresume its debate or hold a vote on the accord until the Palestinian \\nAuthority has taken steps against terrorism. The Cabinet also said \\nit would not resume the ratification process until Palestinian leader \\nYasser Arafat has clarified the procedure for revoking clauses in \\nthe PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The procedure \\nis part of the Wye River agreement negotiated last month. However, \\nIsraelis and Palestinians have widely divergent interpretations of \\nhow the clauses should be rescinded. Israel says it should be done \\nby a vote by the Palestine National Council. The Palestinians say \\na vote is not required. \\n\\nThe radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for \\nthe suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promised more \\nattacks to try to block the new peace accord. ``This heroic operation \\nis not the first and not going to be the last,'' the group said in \\na leaflet faxed to news organizations. ``We refuse any political agreement \\nthat would recognize the Zionist enemy.'' The leaflet could not immediately \\nbe authenticated, but its style was consistent with that of past communications \\nfrom the group. An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of \\nDamascus confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah \\nclaimed responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the \\nParis-based Radio Monte Carlo. Palestinian security sources and the \\nfamilies of the dead bombers had already identified them as Islamic \\nJihad activists. At least half a dozen other Islamic activists have \\nbeen rounded up since the bombing, the sources said. Although Hamas \\ninitially claimed responsibility through anonymous phone calls to \\nthe police, all sides now have agreed that it was Islamic Jihad that \\ncarried it out. There was no immediate explanation for the inaccurate \\nclaim, but the two groups have carried out attacks together in the \\npast as part of their goal of stopping the peace process. \\n\\nA defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel \\nwould continue to build Jewish neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, \\nincluding at a controversial site in the traditionally Arab sector \\nof the city. ``We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in \\nevery part of Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters \\nin Jerusalem, ``By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.'' Har Homa \\nis the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab \\neast Jerusalem. Groundbreaking at the site led to angry Palestinian \\nprotests and a breakdown of peace talks in March 1997. Netanyahu's \\nCabinet delayed action on the new peace accord following Friday's \\nsuicide bombing at a Jerusalem market, and his remarks about building \\non Har Homa may be seen as a provocation by the Palestinians at a \\npolitically sensitive moment. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \\nexpects Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord within a few \\ndays despite the market bombing, a television report said Saturday. \\n``The United States understands the delay by a day or two but expects \\nthe agreement to be approved soon,'' Albright told Prime Minister \\nBenjamin Netanyahu by phone, Channel Two reported. The radical group \\nIslamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the market bombing \\nand vowed more attacks to try to block the new peace accord. ``This \\nheroic operation is not the first and not going to be the last,'' \\nthe group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations. ``We refuse \\nany political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy.'' \\nAn Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus confirmed \\nthat the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility \\nfor Friday's bombing in an interview with the Paris-based Radio Monte \\nCarlo.

One \\nof Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to fight \\nattacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets. The Palestinians, \\nhowever, said the two bombers had come from Israeli-controlled areas \\nand that Israel thus bore at least part of the security responsibility \\nfor the attack. The Israeli military said it could not confirm the \\nsuicide bombers' identities and hometowns, but they were disclosed \\nby Palestinian security officials and also reported by Palestinian \\nmedia. One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, \\nand the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya, \\noutside the town of Jenin. Both families held so-called mourning houses \\non Saturday, but not actual funerals, since Israeli authorities still \\nhave their bodies. ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said \\nMohammed Zughayar, the 54-year-old father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, \\n22. ``I'm proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son.'' The family \\nof Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been married for three \\nmonths to Zughayar's sister, Basma. They met when she was visiting \\nher brother, who was in prison with Dahayneh, the family said. At \\nthe market, some 200 observant Jews gathered Saturday night near the \\nsite of the bombing to offer prayers of thanks that no lives other \\nthan those of the assailants were lost. A ring of young men wearing \\nskullcaps joined hands and danced, and rabbis spoke of the ``miracle'' \\nthat had saved those shopping in the market at the time of the attack. \\nAlthough Hamas initially claimed responsibility through anonymous \\nphone calls to the police for Friday's attack all sides now have agreed \\nthat it was Islamic Jihad that carried it out. \\n\\nA defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel \\nwould continue to build Jewish neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, \\nincluding at a controversial site in the traditionally Arab sector \\nof the city. ``We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in \\nevery part of Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters \\nin Jerusalem, ``By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.''

The Islamic militant \\ngroup Hamas, which has tried to stop the peace agreement, claimed \\nresponsibility, police said. In response to the attack, the Israeli \\ncabinet suspended ratification of the Wye agreement until there ``is \\nverification that the Palestinian authority is indeed fighting terrorism.'' \\nThe Israeli Cabinet also announced it will begin to build houses in \\nthe controversial Jewish settlement of Har Homa in east Jerusalem. \\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had held up the work in recent months \\nin an apparent attempt to not disrupt negotiations with the Palestinians. \\nAides to Netanyahu were not immediately available for comment. The \\nCabinet ministers had just begun a second day of of talks on the peace \\nagreement about a mile (kilometer) away from the entrance to the market \\nand just meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing last year. \\nIn Friday's explosion, the rigged car, a red Fiat, blew up at about \\n9:45 a.m. (0745 GMT) at the entrance of Mahane Yehuda market, just \\nmeters (yards) away from the site of a suicide bombing in July 1997. \\nWitnesses heard a series of small explosions. Yair Cohen, 43, said \\nhe was buying cookies when he saw a car driving slowly, with smoke \\ncoming out of the hood and exhaust pipes. ``People started to shout \\n`car on fire.' After a while, we heard a blast, and something hit \\nme in the stomach,'' said Cohen who was treated for minor injuries \\nat Hadassah Hospital. The car was a mass of twisted metal sitting \\nin the middle of the main intersection outside the market. Flames \\nshot 100 feet (30 meters) in the air. A charred corpse, covered by \\na blanket, lay several meters away. Streams of soot-black water ran \\nin the street. Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, \\nin a pool of blood below the head. Rescue workers covered the body \\nwith sodden pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags. ``There \\nwas hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an Israeli border \\npoliceman who was patrolling the market and was lightly injured. One \\nheavy-set woman, apparently in shock, climbed into an ambulance, weeping. \\nThree paramedics talked to her, persuading her that she did not need \\nmedical treatment, and after a few moments she climbed out of the \\nvehicle again. Soldiers and police wearing plastic gloves held back \\nthe crowds. ``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted. Just a block \\naway from the blast, shoppers went about their business. One young \\nwoman shopper said: ``We can't stop with what we are doing when this \\nhappens.'' Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, said the \\nPalestinian Authority condemned the attack. ``This is a crime and \\nwhoever commits this, hurts the interests of the Palestinian people.'' \\n\\nSetting the stage for a new quarrel over how to crack down on militants, \\nIsrael is demanding that the military wings of two radical Islamic \\ngroups be outlawed, while the Palestinian Authority insists it has \\nalready banned them. Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security \\naccord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past \\nweek, but has hit various snags. Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put \\noff a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in \\nJerusalem that killed the two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. \\nThe radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility. David Bar-Illan, \\na top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday \\nthat Israel expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw \\nthe military wings of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group \\nHamas. Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian official, said Hamas' military \\nwing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic Jihad were \\noutlawed by the Palestinian Authority in 1996. But Bar-Illan said \\nthe Palestinian legislature had never passed such a law. ``Why did \\nMr. Arafat agree in the Wye accord to outlaw them if he has already \\ndone it?'' he asked. The Wye memorandum states that the Palestinian \\nAuthority ``will inform the United States fully of the actions it \\nhas taken to outlaw all organizations (or wings of organizations, \\nas appropriate) of a military, terrorist or violent character, and \\ntheir support structure and to prevent them freedom of action in the \\nareas under its jurisdiction.'' A Palestinian security official, speaking \\non condition of anonymity, said a joint Israeli-Palestinian meeting \\nwas held Saturday night to discuss security in the wake of Friday's \\nattack. Participants included the head of the Palestinian intelligence, \\nAmin Hindi, and the head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip, \\nMohammed Dahlan. The idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was \\nbrought up in the meeting and also proposed by Netanyahu to Arafat \\nduring a phone call, the official said. The Palestinians said they \\ncould ban activity by Hamas or Islamic Jihad that endangered either \\nIsraelis or Palestinians, but could not outlaw them outright as political \\nmovements. Friday's bombing led to finger-pointing by both sides. \\nIsrael said it showed Arafat's crackdown on terrorists had not been \\nsweeping enough. The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel \\nof failing to take at least partial security responsibility for the \\nattack, because both attackers came from Israeli-controlled areas, \\nand had recently served time in Israeli jails. Israel as a rule is \\nharshly critical of the Palestinian Authority's security efforts when \\nattackers come from Palestinian-controlled areas or have been released \\nfrom Palestinian prisons. On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister \\nFreih Abu-Medein accused Netanyahu of using the blast as a pretext \\nfor delaying implementation of the peace accord. ``This attack is \\na gift to Mr. Netanyahu,'' Abu-Medein said. ``All the time he is praying \\nto God to help him ... to escape from the agreement.'' Under the accord, \\nIsrael is to hand over another 13 percent of the territory in the \\nWest Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for various security steps. \\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predicted Sunday that the \\nIsraeli Cabinet would ratify the agreement in coming days. ``I estimate \\nthat the government will meet this week and will accept the decision \\nof the majority (in favor of the agreement),'' he said. \\n\", \"\\nPresident Boris Yeltsin, on his first trip out of Russia since this \\nspring, canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because \\nhe wasn't feeling well, his spokesman said. Yeltsin appeared stiff \\nand stumbled during another public ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent, \\nthe capital of this Central Asian nation, and had to be supported \\nby Uzbek President Islam Karimov. But the two later held a one-on-one \\nsummit as scheduled. The trip is Yeltsin's first high-profile foray \\nsince an economic crisis swamped his country in August. The 67-year-old \\npresident, whose health has often sidelined him during his seven years \\nin power, has spent most of the last two months out of the limelight \\nand out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country home outside \\nMoscow. His last foreign trip was to Britain in May, when he attended \\na summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. During \\nhis visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin is expected \\nto discuss improving Russia's relations with the two former Soviet \\nrepublics, whose economies have suffered residual effects of the crisis \\nthat hit Russia after it devalued its currency in August and defaulted \\non some of its debt. On Sunday, Yeltsin had been scheduled to lay \\nwreaths at a monument to Alisher Naboi, an 16th century Uzbek poet, \\nand salute an Uzbek honor guard, but both ceremonies were canceled. \\n``This week was extremely tense. (Yeltsin) was affected by a difficult \\nflight and the end of a difficult week,'' Yeltsin's chief spokesman, \\nDmitry Yakushkin, told a news conference. ``He has a cold. He was \\ncoughing when we spoke.'' It was sunny and about 14 degrees C (57 \\ndegrees F) in Tashkent on Sunday. Yakushkin said Yeltsin's schedule \\nMonday may also change depending on how he feels. Yeltsin and Karimov \\nlater met at a government residence outside Tashkent and signed several \\nagreements on fighting smuggling and other crime and expanding cultural \\nties. The two sides are expected to sign economic agreements Monday. \\nLater Monday, Yeltsin is to go to Kazakstan, where he and Kazak President \\nNursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on economic, \\nscience and technical cooperation and on combating drug trafficking. \\nLast week, Yeltsin said he also planned to discuss the situation in \\nAfghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak counterparts. Russia and the \\ntwo republics fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, \\nand possibly a spillover of fighting that has wracked the country. \\nYeltsin was accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Defense Minister \\nIgor Sergeyev, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, officials from the \\nFederal Border Guard Service, the State Customs Committee, the Defense \\nMinistry, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. \\n\\nRussia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether \\nBoris Yeltsin can seek a third term. The issue was controversial earlier \\nthis year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his \\naides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election. It has \\nlost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically and politically \\nweaker and has said he will not run again. The court will take at \\nleast a week to consider the issue, the Interfax news agency reported. \\nThe Russian Constitution has a two-term limit for presidents. But \\nYeltsin's aides say his first term, from 1991 to 1996, does not count \\nbecause it began six months before the Soviet Union collapsed and \\nbefore the current constitution took effect. Communists and other \\nYeltsin opponents in parliament's lower house, the State Duma, disagreed \\nand appealed to the Constitutional Court in February. While the case \\nhas been waiting to be heard, events have overtaken it. Yeltsin has \\nflatly said he will not seek another term, and the opposition has \\nconcentrated its efforts on demanding an early resignation, riding \\na wave of popular discontent over the economic crisis. The call for \\nYeltsin to step down was backed by many participants in a nationwide \\nlabor action earlier this month that attracted about 1 million people. \\nYeltsin's growing health problems would also seem to rule out another \\nelection campaign. A respiratory infection forced him to cut short \\na trip to Central Asia earlier this week. On Wednesday, parliament's \\nupper chamber, the Federation Council, voted on a resolution calling \\non Yeltsin to resign, but it failed narrowly. Even if had passed, \\nthe move would have had no legal consequences, but it highlighted \\ngrowing anti-Yeltsin sentiments in the chamber made up of powerful \\nregional leaders, most of whom have been loyal to the president. Mikhail \\nMityukov, the presidential representative on the Constitutional Court, \\nsaid Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore calls for an early resignation. \\n``The president is a strong person, and he has been through far more \\ndifficult political situations,'' Mityukov said, according to Interfax. \\n\\nPresident Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, \\nhis press office said Thursday. Asked about small bandages that were \\nvisible on Yeltsin's hand during an awards ceremony, the press office \\nsaid the president had sustained small burns. It did not say what \\nhad caused them. \\n\\nRussian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his \\nlatest illness, has canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, \\nhis office said Friday. Government sources said the president has \\nalso called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin \\nsaid those plans were still going forward. Yeltsin has decided to \\nsend Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the November summit of the \\nAsia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur because it deals mostly \\nwith financial issues, Yeltsin's office said. But sources in Primakov's \\noffice said the cancellation was due to concerns about how the long \\nflight might effect the president's health. The president has been \\nsuffering from bronchitis and a cold this week, which forced him to \\ncut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday. He was spending Friday \\nat a country home outside Moscow after defying the orders of his doctors \\nand working in the Kremlin for the past two days. Aides said the president's \\ncondition was ``satisfactory.'' Yeltsin is still planning to go to \\nVienna for an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nations, the president's \\noffice said. In another development, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, considered \\na potential presidential candidate, said Thursday that he wouldn't \\nexclude the possibility of Yeltsin's resignation for health reasons. \\nIn an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., he stopped short \\nof calling on Yeltsin to step down. But Luzhkov has always been supportive \\nof Yeltsin and had never before questioned the president's health \\nor ability to govern. ``According to our constitution, the president \\nhimself has to say he is not able to work,'' Luzhkov said in an interview \\nwith the BBC in Moscow. ``And because of (Yeltsin's) poor health, \\nhe is no longer able to give the country as much time as it demands.'' \\nLuzhkov's spokesman Mikhail Solomentsev refused to elaborate on the \\nstatement. Yeltsin has a long history of health problems, including \\na heart bypass surgery two years ago. Each new ailment rekindles speculation \\nabout his fitness to govern. The president and his doctors say Yeltsin \\nhas no serious health problems and will serve out the final two years \\nof his term. \\n\\nDoctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central \\nAsian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return \\nhome Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said. Yeltsin was \\nsuffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 \\nFahrenheit) and was being treated with antibiotics, the president's \\ndoctors told the Interfax news agency. Yeltsin was to fly back to \\nMoscow late Monday, rather than on Tuesday as scheduled, but was going \\nahead with talks, including a meeting with Kazak President Nursultan \\nNazarbayev. He planned to move up all his scheduled meetings before \\nreturning home, aides said. The 67-year-old, 3rd graf pvs \\n\\nRussian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on \\nMonday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about \\nhis overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained \\neconomic crisis. Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted \\ndoubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, \\nin which Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes. \\nMoscow's NTV station said it was a crucial time for Russia, when ``presidential \\ndecisions'' are needed. There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness \\nwould sideline him for any length of time, and aides said the president \\nwould maintain his schedule for the rest of the week. But after a \\nseries of health problems in recent years, including heart bypass \\nsurgery in 1996, every new ailment unleashes a flurry of speculation \\nabout the president's ability to function. The president insists he \\nhas no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two \\nyears of his term. Yeltsin's aides said the president was taking antibiotics \\nto ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius \\n(99.3 Fahrenheit). There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin, who \\narrived in Moscow late Monday night from Almaty, Kazakstan, a day \\nearlier than planned. \\n\\nPresident Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday, nursing a respiratory \\ninfection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip and revived \\nconcerns about his ability to govern. Yeltsin was spending the day \\nat his Gorky-9 country residence just outside Moscow, and will probably \\nnot go into the office all week, his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, \\ntold reporters. However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin \\nsaid. Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia \\na day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from an upper respiratory \\ninfection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 F). They said \\nYeltsin was being treated with antibiotics and there were no plans \\nto hospitalize him. Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, \\nincluding quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever \\nhe gets sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to \\nfunction. Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve \\nout the remaining two years of his term. Yakushkin, his spokesman, \\nreiterated Tuesday there was no talk about an early resignation. ``It's \\nnot being discussed,'' he said. ``I am personally against such a resignation \\nbecause I think it would only bring peril to the nation.'' Yakushkin \\nand other aides sought to play down the seriousness of Yeltsin's illness. \\n``Don't panic, Dad is OK,'' Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana Dyachenko, \\nwho is his official image adviser, told the Kommersant business newspaper. \\nYakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov, confirmed \\nthat the president was suffering from a respiratory infection known \\nas tracheal bronchitis and that ``his condition is stable.'' ``He \\nmust stay in bed like any other person,'' Yakushkin said. ``However, \\nknowing the president's character, he is certain to start working \\nwith documents and making phone calls to Russian politicians as well \\nas foreign leaders in view of the current situation in Kosovo.'' But \\nthe Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page editorial Tuesday \\nthat Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering from something worse \\nthan a cold. It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current \\neconomic crisis ``amounts to a state catastrophe'' and called on Yeltsin \\nto immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny \\nPrimakov. A Communist lawmaker also called for ``an urgent medical \\ncheck ... on the Russian president's health'' to determine whether \\nhe is fit to remain in office, the Interfax news agency said. ``Yeltsin's \\nobvious inability to perform his functions is damaging Russian state \\nauthority, as power is being misused by the clique close to the president,'' \\nsaid Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of parliament's security committee. \\nThe health of the president, who is also commander-in-chief of the \\nRussian military, ``is a direct threat to the country's national security \\nand a factor of serious concern regarding Russia's nuclear weapons,'' \\nhe said. Other newspapers gave a detailed description of Yeltsin's \\nweaknesses and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former Soviet \\nrepublics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan _ his first foray abroad since \\na visit to Britain in May. The president appeared stiff and stumbled \\nwhen he arrived Sunday in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had \\nto be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled his \\nother public events. At a state dinner on Sunday, Yeltsin made rambling \\nremarks, expressing his satisfaction with local ``facilities and stores'' \\nhe never inspected, the daily Kommersant reported. On Monday, ``the \\npresident didn't seem to understand that he wasn't in Moscow,'' Kommersant \\nsaid, saying he called aides and spoke as though they were late for \\nwork at the Kremlin. He turned up more than an hour late for talks \\nwith Uzbek officials, making some incoherent remarks interrupted by \\na bad cough and abruptly cutting short a scheduled news conference. \\n\\nWeakened by a cold yet animated, President Boris Yeltsin defied doctors' \\norders and quashed rumors he is seriously ill by showing up unexpectedly \\nat the Kremlin on Wednesday. Still, his appearance didn't silence \\nthe growing number of calls for his resignation. Hours after he returned \\nto work, the generally pro-Yeltsin upper house of parliament fell \\njust 11 votes short of passing a motion urging him to step down over \\nhis social welfare policies. Yeltsin, 67, has a respiratory infection \\nthat forced him to cut short his first foreign visit in months on \\nMonday. Whenever Yeltsin falls ill, speculation arises about his ability \\nto govern. This time, however, the prospect of him leaving office \\nhas aroused less panic, since he has largely faded from the limelight \\nin recent months and left his government to grapple with Russia's \\neconomic crisis. ``There will be no turmoil if Yeltsin leaves the \\npolitical arena. The government is already in charge, (Prime Minister \\nYevgeny) Primakov is strong enough and has the support of the security \\nservices,'' said Yevgeny Volk, director of the Moscow office of the \\nU.S.-based Heritage Foundation. ``Everyone knows Yeltsin is ailing \\nand is politically weakened,'' he said. Yeltsin has a history of health \\nproblems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996. Still, he insists \\nhe has no major illnesses and plans to serve out the remaining two \\nyears of his term. ``I can't even sneeze'' without someone making \\na fuss about it, he joked with Primakov during a meeting Wednesday. \\nIn the Kremlin, Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Primakov, \\nForeign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian \\nnews agencies said. Yeltsin looked wan and tired and walked stiffly, \\nbut he was smiling, gesturing animatedly and joking with his ministers. \\nThe start of the meeting was shown on Russian television. Primakov \\nsaid afterward that Yeltsin waved his hand dismissively ``when we \\nreminded him that he should stay in bed during his illness'' and said \\nof his doctors: ``Don't listen to them.'' The upper house of parliament \\nwas busy voting on a motion saying he should resign. The vote in the \\nFederation Council, which is made up of regional leaders, was 79 to \\n18 in favor, Russian news agencies reported. It did not pass because \\nit required a simple majority of 90 votes. The motion carries no legal \\nweight, but it reflects growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber \\nthat has generally supported him. The prime minister reiterated Wednesday \\nthat Yeltsin has no plans to resign or call early elections. ``There \\nis no reason for rocking the boat and demanding anyone's resignation,'' \\nPrimakov said, according to the Interfax news agency. ``What happens \\nto the anti-crisis steps if elections are held now?'' Yeltsin's resignation \\nis highly unlikely. If he were to step down or die, Primakov would \\ntake power and elections would have to be held within three months. \\nMany Russians view Yeltsin with increasing pity. ``I feel for him. \\nHe's clearly not a healthy person,'' film director Vladimir Khotinenko \\nwas quoted as saying by the daily Kommersant. ``It's time for him \\nto step aside.'' Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday \\nand his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be \\nin the office all week. Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during \\nhis visit to Central Asia on Sunday and Monday. He canceled most of \\nhis public engagements, except for a state dinner at which he made \\nrambling remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short. \\n\\nPresident Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced his health ``more \\nor less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday. \\nMrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitated \\neven to touch on her husband's health ``when there is so much conjecture \\non this topic.'' Still, she noted that he had regular medical check-ups. \\n``The doctors say now: Everything is more or less normal,'' Mrs. Yeltsin \\ndeclared. The 67-year-old Yeltsin's health has long been a concern, \\nand the worry has been amplified by the secrecy surrounding his condition. \\nYeltsin suffered from heart disease during the 1996 presidential election \\nand had a heart attack, followed by multiple bypass surgery, in the \\nmonths after his victory. Mrs. Yeltsin expressed understanding for \\nRussians who took part Wednesday in protests for unpaid wages. She \\nalso said that criticism of the president was normal, though it was \\noffensive when it focused on anything other than his professional \\nperformance, such as his age. ``It seems to me ... that people expected \\na miracle from him,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said. ``But surely you can't curse \\na person for not being a magician.'' Mrs. Yeltsin refuted rumors that \\nher family would leave Russia after Yeltsin leaves office in 2000 \\nas ``absolute nonsense.'' ``I think we'll live like all normal people. \\nAt least it will be calmer than it is now.'' \\n\\nRussia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether \\nBoris Yeltsin can seek a third term. The issue was controversial earlier \\nthis year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his \\naides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election. It has \\nlost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically and politically \\nweaker and has said he will not run again. The Russian Constitution \\nhas a two-term limit for presidents. But Yeltsin's aides say his first \\nterm, from 1991 to 1996, does not count because it began six months \\nbefore the Soviet Union collapsed and before the current constitution \\ntook effect. Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's \\nlower house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional \\nCourt in February. While the case has been waiting to be heard, events \\nhave overtaken it. Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another \\nterm, and the opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding \\nan early resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the \\neconomic crisis. The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many \\nparticipants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that \\nattracted about 1 million people. Yeltsin's growing health problems \\nwould also seem to rule out another election campaign. A respiratory \\ninfection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this \\nweek. On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, \\nvoted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it failed \\nnarrowly. Even if had passed, the move would have had no legal consequences, \\nbut it highlighted growing anti-Yeltsin sentiments in the chamber \\nmade up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have been loyal \\nto the president. Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative \\non the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore \\ncalls for an early resignation. ``The president is a strong person, \\nand he has been through far more difficult political situations,'' \\nMityukov said, according to the Interfax news agency. \\n\", \"\\nPremier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes freed up from a \\nsplit in a far-left party, but said he will resign if he loses a confidence \\nvote expected later this week. ``We must respect the will of the voters. \\nIf we win the confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will \\npass the baton,'' Prodi told a news conference closing a two-day French-Italian \\nsummit in Florence. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest \\nsince World War II, was threatened with collapse by the defection \\nof its Communist ally. The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, \\nfollowed perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine \\nwhether the 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls. \\nThe Communist Refoundation Party provoked the crisis by withdrawing \\nits support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his \\ndeficit-cutting 1999 budget. But the break with Prodi's government \\ndivided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, \\nresigned as party president Monday, saying the party's hardline stance \\nwas ``wrong and dangerous.'' Prodi was hoping to profit from the break. \\nPoliticians have said Prodi is now four votes short of the 316 votes \\nneeded for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house. \\nThe government has a majority in the Senate even without Refoundation's \\nsupport. After his meetings with French leaders, Prodi warned that \\nthe political difficulties threaten the progress the country is making \\nin cleaning up its public finances. Prodi's government has held together \\nthis long in large part because of the widely shared desire to see \\nItaly qualify for the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the \\neuro. It qualified earlier this year _ leaving the disparate allies \\nwithout so clear a reason to stay together. As it is, Prodi has outlasted \\nall but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two back-to-back stints \\nfrom 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World \\nWar II. \\n\\nItalian politics have long been enlivened by baroque feuds and shifting \\nalliances. And that time-honored tradition may have won the embattled \\ngovernment of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a momentary reprieve. A \\nleader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist \\nRefounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision \\nto reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender \\nmajority in Parliament. ``Prodi must realize that his majority no \\nlonger exists,'' said Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding \\nParty, a fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after \\nthey overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union \\nin 1991. ``Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the \\nlast minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis.'' Cossuta \\nwas clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of his party \\nin withdrawing support from Prodi and risk being branded as having \\ntorpedoed the first leftist Italian government in 50 years. But the \\nleader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, \\nseems to have no such compunctions. On Friday, he told journalists \\nthat he was not worried about forcing new elections that could return \\nthe right to power. ``Sometimes you have to take one step back in \\norder to take two steps forward,'' he said with a shrug. Until now, \\nhowever, the communist rank and file have disagreed with that view. \\nWhen Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over \\nproposed budget cuts, the rank and file protested, and he was forced \\nto backpedal. Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro \\nand coalition leaders to devise a strategy. He is expected to go to \\nParliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek enough \\nvotes for the budget. Without it, the Italian central bank is unlikely \\nto cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do to get in line \\nwith Germany and other bigger European neighbors before the introduction \\nJan. 1 of the single European currency, the euro. But even if he gathers \\nenough votes to pass the budget, Prodi could still be left without \\na majority. After two and a half years in office, his government is \\nthe second-longest in the postwar era. But the fragile center-left \\ncoalition has held together mostly because Italians were united for \\nthe last two years in an effort to reduce spending, inflation and \\ngovernment borrowing to meet the requirements for membership in the \\neuro plan. Once that goal was achieved last spring, dissension quickly \\nrevived. Prodi's backers are hoping that enough members of the Communist \\nRefounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta to save the \\ncoalition. If not, Prodi is faced with two unappetizing choices. He \\ncan resign and seek new elections, which carry the risk of bringing \\nthe opposition to power. Or he could seek to form a new majority without \\nthe Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right \\nparty of Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came to Prodi's rescue \\nin June, when the hard-line leftists refused to back Prodi on NATO \\nexpansion. But Prodi has repeatedly said he will govern only with \\nthe center-left majority that elected him in 1996. Cossiga also suggested \\nto reporters Monday that he would not welcome any invitations to join \\na coalition led by Prodi. ``We wouldn't want this majority to get \\nstained like Monica Lewinsky's dress,'' he said. \\n\\nItaly's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier \\nRomano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger \\nthe collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments. \\nProdi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked \\nsupport. The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the \\nSenate, but has depended on them for passage of key legislation in \\nthe Chamber. MORE \\n\\nBy only one vote, the center-left prime minister of Italy, Romano \\nProdi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament Friday and was toppled \\nfrom power. The collapse of his government after two and a half years, \\nthe second-longest tenure since World War II, suggested that the chronic \\npolitical instability that marked Italy for decades had sprung back \\nto life. Though obliged to tender his resignation, Prodi will remain \\nin charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is \\nformed. He may get a second chance to form a new majority, but even \\nif he does, negotiations to that end could take days and even weeks, \\nclouding decisions on such urgent issues as the crisis in Kosovo. \\nNATO military planners preparing for possible air strikes against \\nYugoslavia had expected to use key air bases in Italy. In his weakened \\nposition, Prodi will have difficulty persuading Parliament to approve \\nNATO strikes. He will have similar problems passing the 1999 budget, \\nwhich is necessary before Italy can cut its lending rates, a requirement \\nfor joining the single European monetary unit, the euro, on Jan. 1. \\nImmediately after Friday's vote of 313-312, in a tense and at times \\nraucous session, Prodi met with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to \\nsubmit his resignation and discuss his options. In the coming days \\nScalfaro will consult with dozens of other leaders to ascertain whether \\nProdi has enough lingering support to try to form a new government. \\nIf not, the president is expected to turn to another political leader. \\nIf no compromise is found, Italy could be plunged into early elections. \\nBut parties of all political stripes may be reluctant to push things \\nthat far, for opinion polls suggest that voters are no more enamored \\nof the center-right opposition parties than they are of the governing \\nmajority. Prodi, an economist, is admired by his Western allies as \\na down-to-earth leader who vowed to tame Italy's bloated economy and \\nreckless government borrowing and actually lived up to his pledge. \\nBy raising taxes, lowering interest rates and reducing the deficit, \\nItaly met the requirements for membership in the euro last spring, \\na feat that only a year before was considered impossible by German \\nand French economists. Prodi was helped by a healthy global economy \\nand a rare consensus among industrialists, labor unions and taxpayers, \\nwho feared that exclusion from the euro would condemn Italy to Third \\nWorld status. But his fiscal discipline was not followed by reform \\nof a political system that is inherently fragile. There are more than \\n40 parties in Italy, and the government's efforts to amend the constitution \\nto introduce a two-party system failed. ``Unless the Italian political \\nsystem changes, Italy is condemned to political instability,'' said \\nSergio Romano, a former diplomat and political science professor. \\n``The country needs stability and credibility, and that will never \\nhappen as long as the government is hanging from a thread.'' In 1996 \\nProdi won with a patchwork quilt of center-left factions mostly made \\nup of Catholic moderates and leftists. He relied on a fringe Marxist \\ngroup, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the lower \\nhouse. And that alliance, fragile from the beginning, finally frayed \\nto the breaking point this week. The hard-line leader of Communist \\nRefounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said his party would vote against the \\n1999 budget and would also end its 28-month-old pact with the center-left \\ncoalition. That position drove the moderate wing of Communist Refounding, \\nworried that a vote against Prodi would open the doors to a center-right \\ngovernment, to split away. But the 20-odd deputies who defied Bertinotti \\nwere not enough to squeeze Prodi through. ``I am not bitter,'' Prodi \\nsaid moments after his defeat. ``Even today I received a lot of support.'' \\nIn the end the coup de grace was delivered by one of his own, a member \\nof the coalition. ``They have won by the treachery of one single person,'' \\nSergio Mattarella, a deputy in Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporters, \\nreferring to Silvio Liotta, a member of the Italian Renewal Party. \\nForeign Minister Lamberto Dini, who heads that party, said Liotta \\nwould be expelled. Prodi has often said he would not govern with any \\nother majority than the center-left one that elected him in 1996. \\nBut throughout his tenure, he was forced to seek temporary alliances \\nto push through major policy decisions. He struggled to the last to \\ntry to keep his original majority intact. On Thursday, in an effort \\nto woo more moderate Communists to his side, the prime minister, a \\nstaunch ally of the United States, warned that he would oppose a NATO \\nstrike aimed at stopping Serbian violence in Kosovo unless the U.N. \\nSecurity Council approved the attack. Washington maintains that NATO \\ndoes not need a new U.N. resolution to order a strike. \\n\\nBy one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence \\nvote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential \\npalace to resign.

The vote, 3rd graf prv \\n\\nThree days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left \\ngovernment, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday \\nto try to reach a consensus on a new government. Following the talks, \\nwhich are expected to last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro \\ncould ask Prodi to try again with a new majority. He could also name \\na new premier, or appoint a government of technocrats. If Scalfaro \\nfeels no candidate is capable of mustering a majority, he could call \\nearly elections. Because the president cannot dissolve Parliament \\nduring the last six weeks of his term, elections would have to be \\nscheduled by December. Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier \\nfor the interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked \\nthe crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999 \\ndeficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to stimulate \\njob creation. Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists, \\nwho on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence \\nby a single vote. Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless \\nhis new government could stick to the policies of its old one, an \\nunlikely scenario given the divided Parliament. An alternative to \\nProdi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democrats of the Left, \\nthe largest party in Prodi's coalition. In the case of a so-called \\n``technical'' government, the names of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio \\nCiampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A \\ngovernment of technicians would get Italy through the volatile period \\nof approving the 1999 budget and the launch of the common European \\ncurrency, the euro, in January 1999. Prodi presided over cost cuts \\nthat got Italy into the debut of the European Monetary Union, outlasting \\nall but one other post-World War II Italian government in the process. \\n\\nPremier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly to Parliament \\nto save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened \\nwith collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. The address \\nto Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed perhaps by Friday by \\nthe vote of confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, \\ncenter-left alliance stands or falls. Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist \\nRefoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support \\nover the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting \\n1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European \\ncommon currency. Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if \\nhe lost the Communists' support. ``I've always acted with coherence,'' \\nProdi said before a morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro \\non the crisis. ``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do \\npolitical gymnastics.'' The break with Prodi's government divided \\nRefoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned \\nas party president Monday. He said the party's desertion of Prodi \\nwas ``wrong and dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow \\nthe party line. ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which \\ncould lead to early elections,'' Cossutta told reporters Monday. ``And \\nwith the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the \\nright.'' If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, \\nhe would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to Scalfaro \\nto decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else to form a \\nnew government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something \\nmost analysts think unlikely. Working in Prodi's favor is the fact \\nthat few parties think they would stand to gain by early elections, \\nincluding the Communist Refoundation. There was speculation Prodi \\nwould reopen negotiations that would win back the communists' grudging \\nsupport, as he has managed to do in the past. Prodi's government has \\nheld together this long in large part because of the widely shared \\ndesire to see Italy qualify for participation in the 1999 debut of \\nEurope's common currency, the euro. That happened earlier this year \\n_ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together. \\nProdi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II. He has outlasted \\nall but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two back-to-back stints \\nfrom 1983 to 1987. Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left \\ncoalition, but the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority \\nin the lower house. It has been a difficult ally from the outset. \\nIt broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on sending \\ntroops into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to resign a year \\nago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked to the euro. The \\ncrisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work, after he made steep \\nconcessions and promised a 35-hour work week. \\n\\nIt is autumn in Italy, the birds are going south, and so it seems \\ncould the Italian government, as the bonds of compromise and political \\nopportunism that bind a small leftist party to the government came \\nundone Sunday. The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister \\nRomano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist \\nRefounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, \\nimperiling the future of the center-left coalition. Officials in the \\nprime minister's office said Sunday night that Prodi would meet on \\nMonday with President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro to discuss the political \\nturbulence, though not to offer his resignation. If the Communist \\nRefounding's parliamentary deputies abide by the resolution, which \\npassed by a vote of 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government \\nat a time when the outcome of the recent election in Germany has already \\ninjected a note of uncertainty into the future of European economic \\nand fiscal policy. Mauro Zani, a spokesman for the Democratic Party \\nof the Left, the main party in Prodi's coalition, called the decision \\nby Communist Refounding a ``misfortune for the entire country.'' Passage \\nof the budget, he said, is essential ``to avoid disaster.'' Prodi's \\ncoalition is a loose alliance of the former Communists, known as the \\nDemocratic Party of the Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented \\nfollowers. It is supported by Communist Refounding, a fringe group \\nof hard-line leftists who broke with the mainstream Communists after \\nthey overhauled the party following the collapse of Communism in Eastern \\nEurope. Despite frequent shocks, the alliance has held since 1996, \\nglued together mainly by the desire to meet the fiscal requirements \\nto allow Italy to adopt the single European currency. As the Jan. \\n1 date approaches for the introduction of the new money, the euro, \\nItaly must cut its key lending rates to bring them in line with those \\nof bigger European neighbors, like Germany. A rate cut by the Italian \\ncentral bank is generally thought to hinge on passage of the budget \\nbill. If the bill is not passed, negative signals would be sent to \\nglobal financial markets that are already upset because of the financial \\ncrises in Asia, Russia and Latin America. On Sunday, Prodi's backers \\nwere still hoping that a sufficient number of Communist Refounding \\ndeputies would break ranks and back the budget when it comes up for \\na vote in Parliament later this week. If that fails, a centrist group \\nthat rescued Prodi in June under similar circumstances and that is \\nled by former President Francesco Cossiga announced it would support \\nthe budget, thus at least assuring parliamentary passage. Communist \\nRefounding and its mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have pushed \\nProdi to the brink twice before. The party forced him to offer his \\nresignation last year over proposed budget cuts, but then backpeddled \\nafter the party's rank and file protested. In June, the hard-line \\nleftists again refused to follow the prime minister, that time in \\na Parliament vote for NATO expansion, but the government muddled through \\nwith the help of Cossiga's party. But one of the leaders of that centrist \\ngroup, Clemente Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support the \\ngovernment generally, leaving the future of Prodi's coalition highly \\nuncertain. \\n\", \"\\nNAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives \\nof the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously \\ninjured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern \\nDistrict of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday. The blast at \\nthe embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of \\nthem Americans, and injured 5,400. In an nearly simultaneous bombing \\nof the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people \\nwere killed and 85 were injured, none of them Americans. The official, \\nwho could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed \\nat gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the \\npre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection \\nwith the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed \\nDaoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the \\nSouthern District of New York. All three have pleaded innocent. Fazul \\nAbdullah Mohammed is a fugitive. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the \\nalleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the \\nworld, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's \\nterrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page \\nindictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings. Bin Laden is \\nbelieved to be living in Afghanistan. U.S. law provides for the trial \\nin the United States of those charged in terror attacks against American \\ncitizens, even if carried out on foreign soil. \\n\\nSometime in the summer of 1997, an operative for Osama bin Laden sat \\ndown at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya. He was worried, \\nhe wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa \\nnetwork'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a \\nworldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans. The organization, \\nthe author complained, had declared war against the United States, \\nyet he had learned of that only from the news media. The writer, who \\nfederal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one \\nof the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi \\na year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest \\nof an aide to bin Laden. Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said \\nhe was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, \\nseemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.'' He said the Americans \\nwere breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that \\nhe had to take precautions. ``The cell is at 100 percent danger,'' \\nthe operative warned. The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital \\nevidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer \\nin a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed \\nin U.S. District Court in New York City. The papers said the computer \\nwas seized in August 1997 in a raid by Kenyan authorities that was \\nattended by an FBI agent. The documents did not make clear whether \\nthe FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings \\nof the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. \\n7 of this year. The timing is potentially important because there \\nhave been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the \\nUnited States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist \\nattack on American targets in Kenya. Officials of the FBI and the \\nU.S. attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night \\nat what point FBI agents learned of the computer file, nor would they \\nmake any other comment. Fazil eluded American investigators after \\nthe bombing as he traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands \\nand then to the Middle East. He remains a fugitive. The dispatch provides \\na remarkable insight into the workings of a terrorist network in the \\ntwilight of the 20th century. The author talks of how he and his fellow \\noperatives follow events on CNN and use the Internet to communicate. \\nHe refers to himself as the media information officer of the East \\nAfrica cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on \\nbig decisions. Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document \\nseems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against \\nbin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that \\nhis operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's \\ndoor by federal authorities _ the attacks on American soldiers in \\nSomalia in 1993 and 1994. The writer of the document warned that the \\nfollowers of bin Laden, whom he referred to as ``the sheik,'' had \\n``become America's primary target.'' He said his comrades in East \\nAfrica ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence \\nactivity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of \\nthe members who are associated with the sheik since America knows \\nwell that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's \\ncell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.'' ``They know that \\nsince Kenya was the main gateway for those members, there must be \\na center in Kenya,'' he wrote, concluding: ``We are really in danger.'' \\nThe government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare \\nand transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants. Federal \\nauthorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of \\nbin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about \\nthe ``security'' situation of the cell. Fawwaz, who served as an informal \\npress spokesman for bin Laden in London, was arrested by British authorities \\nin September after the embassy bombings. He has denied any connection \\nto terrorist activities. A translation of the report was part of a \\npackage of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to \\nsupport the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York. It is not \\nclear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded \\nto bin Laden. The documents, which were initially filed in secret, \\ninclude a federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz of conspiring with \\nbin Laden to kill Americans overseas. A second count charges him with \\nsoliciting others to do so. The report made clear that the organization \\nwas being run on a shoestring. Its author wrote that his mother has \\nfallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a \\nvisit. ``What do you think? Keep in mind we only have $500.'' He repeatedly \\nexpressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was \\nin the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. \\n``There is a war and the situation is dangerous,'' he said. He wrote \\nthat American forces kidnapped anyone who threatened the national \\nsecurity or American citizens. The author noted with alarm a recent \\nCIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees \\nhad been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United \\nStates for trial. According to federal authorities, Fazil went on \\nto play a pivotal role in the bombing of the Nairobi embassy. Prosecutors \\nassert that he rented the villa where the bomb was assembled and surveyed \\nthe embassy's security precautions. On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil \\ndrove a pickup truck to the embassy, leading the way for a vehicle \\ncarrying the bomb that killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. \\nThe author of the report said that he stood ready to ``fight the forces \\nof atheism and dictators who wreaked havoc on earth.'' He said that \\nthe group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all \\nits global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground \\nfor a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. \\n``We, the East Africa cell members, do not want to know about the \\noperations plans,'' he wrote, `` since we are just implementers.'' \\n\\nMUNICH, Germany (AP) _ U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension \\nto provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant \\nof Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. \\nMamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, has been jailed since his arrest \\nnear Munich on Sept. 16 by Bavarian authorities acting on a U.S. warrant. \\nUnder German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to \\nturn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their \\nextradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard \\nZierl, said U.S. authorities a few days ago asked the court hearing \\nthe case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary material. Quoting \\nunidentified Bavarian law enforcement sources, Focus newsmagazine \\nreported Saturday that the evidence turned over so far was not very \\nstrong. The magazine said much of it was based on the testimony of \\nan FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who made only vague \\nconnections between Salim and terrorist activities. Zierl declined \\nto comment on the report, but said U.S. authorities probably asked \\nfor more time just a precautionary measure. U.S. authorities charge \\nSalim helped finance, train and arm members of a terrorist organization, \\nincluding the alleged bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. \\nA criminal complaint unsealed Sept. 25 in U.S. District Court in New \\nYork charges him with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass \\ndestruction. \\n\\nIf Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings \\nof the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already \\nclear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness: One of his senior \\naides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years. The \\ngovernment has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym \\nCS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret \\nproceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. According to the government, \\nthe informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period \\nwhen prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks \\non U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. From the court papers filed \\nin the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, \\nit is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to \\nfederal investigators. They have cited the source in the papers filed \\nto support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are \\nunder arrest in Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is \\nthought to be living in Afghanistan. The source is also the basis \\nfor many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin \\nLaden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks \\non U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear \\nweapons. It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere, \\nor hiding under government protection. As recently as 11 days ago, \\nrecords show, the source swore to a 5-page affidavit before a New \\nYork notary summarizing his allegations against bin Laden. Government \\nofficials adamantly declined to say anything about the identity of \\nCS-1, which stands for ``confidential source.'' But at least one operative \\nof bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago \\nthat he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman \\nwho was married to one of bin Laden's relatives. The operative's concerns \\nwere inflamed by a report in a British newspaper that Tayyib was cooperating \\nwith Saudi and U.S. authorities. In an August, 1997 article, The Daily \\nTelegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May \\nand had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts \\nand businesses. The news of Tayyib's possible defection, the East \\nAfrican operative wrote in a report apparently intended for the group's \\ncommanders, ``almost made me explode. ``An important man with close \\nlinks to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, \\nand we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against \\nthat,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security \\nconcerns. Fazil has since been charged in the embassy attacks and \\nremains at large. The report was typed on a computer seized last year \\nby Kenyan authorities, according to a government filing last week \\nin U.S. district court in Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have \\ncharged at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist \\nactivities or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they said their case \\nwill in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, \\nsuggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of \\nbin Laden or his associates. The arrangement appears to have resulted \\nfrom a plea bargain in which the source is cooperating in hopes of \\nreceiving a lesser sentence. There is no indication that the source \\nhas yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take \\nplace after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete. In \\nthe affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading \\nguilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed \\nfrom attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. \\nThe source described taking ``an oath of allegiance'' to follow bin \\nLaden's orders, and gave a detailed account of bin Laden's group, \\nincluding its history and inner workings. The source told of private \\nstatements by bin Laden to other al Qaeda members, encouraging them \\nto attack U.S. troops and other citizens stationed in the Middle East \\nand Africa. ``I either heard these statements myself,'' the source \\nsaid, ``or I read them or learned of them from other al Qaeda members.'' \\nThe government has also said in other court papers that the source \\nhelped identify bin Laden's signature on a 1996 document urging Muslims \\nto kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not \\nbe reached for comment. \\n\\nPolice arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles \\nto encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh \\nafter the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. \\nMufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editors at ``Jago Mujahid'' or \\n``Wake Up Mujahid,'' a monthy magazine published from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi \\ncapital, were jailed for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday. \\nThey were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any \\none for offenses related to national security, the officer said on \\ncondition of anonymity. Those arrested need not be taken to court \\nfor trial for up to three months. Police seized copies of the newspaper \\nfor reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based \\nSaudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United \\nStates of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya \\nand Tanzania in August. Under Taliban rules women may not study or \\nwork outside their houses, and all kinds of light entertainment including \\nmusic are banned. Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals \\nare subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh \\nis a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular laws. \\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't recognized \\nthe Taliban government in Afghanistan. \\n\\nThe man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania \\nand Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he \\nhas lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban \\nmilitia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, \\non Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama \\nbin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States. ``It's \\nover, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's \\nchief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an \\ninterview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. \\n``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. ... He is \\na free man.'' The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political \\nactivity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban \\ninformation minister said in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir \\nKhan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich \\nman, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, \\na claim not immediately corroborated. \\n\\nAlbania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama \\nBin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the \\nAugust embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated \\nother parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported. The newspaper quoted \\nFatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the Albanian intelligence service, \\nas saying that Bin Laden's network had sent units to fight in Kosovo, \\nthe neighboring Serbian province. ``Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Algerians, \\nTunisians, Sudanese and Kuwaitis _ they come from several different \\norganizations,'' Klosi was quoted as telling The Sunday Times. He \\nsaid he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of \\nEurope from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, \\nwho have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers. \\nInterpol believes more than 100,000 blank Albanian passports were \\nstolen in riots last year, providing ample opportunity for terrorists \\nto acquire false papers, the newspaper said. Apparent confirmation \\nof the Bin Laden's activities came earlier this month during the murder \\ntrial of Claude Kader, 27, a French national and self-confessed member \\nof Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said. Kader claimed \\nduring the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters \\nfor Kosovo, and that four of his associates were still at large. Bin \\nLaden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 \\nafter telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian \\nagency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. \\n\\nThe United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a \\nSudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month \\nto a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind \\nof the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to \\nU.S. intelligence officials. The evidence, the officials said last \\nweek, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical \\nplant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic \\nJihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there \\nof President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives \\nmoney and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his \\nterror network, the officials added. This evidence was uncovered after \\nthe United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following \\nthe bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said. A spokesman \\nfor Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either \\nto bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups. In a statement provided \\nby Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely \\nno relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in \\nthe world. I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with \\nhim, I have never had any financial or business relationship with \\nhim, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.'' U.S. officials \\nsay they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi \\npresence in Sudan since the missile attack. Officials said they were \\nnot certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum. But intelligence \\nagents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa \\nplant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the \\nchemical weapons program. In addition, a soil sample that the CIA \\nclandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical \\nused in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. \\nThe new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over his \\ndecision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department and CIA \\nofficials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based \\non tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. \\nThe criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States \\nhas poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since \\n1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996. In addition, more than \\n100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn \\nin January 1996 because they proved to be fabrications. That year \\na second informer warned of several terrorist threats, including one \\nagainst Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his \\nreports proved impossible to confirm. Senior administration officials \\nsay that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence \\nof Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, \\nbut no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. \\nNow they say that the new evidence against Idris has confirmed their \\ninitial suspicions about Al Shifa. At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise \\nmissile attack, Clinton administration officials acknowledge, they \\ndid not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory. The CIA, which had \\nbegun to scrutinize the plant 18 months earlier, believed the plant's \\nownership was irrelevant. ``What we knew about the ownership was that \\na lot of it couldn't be reliably established,'' said one senior U.S. \\nintelligence official. Still, after the missile strike, when Idris \\nwas publicly identified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate \\nhis possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism. A Sudanese \\nexpatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was previously \\na senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. \\nHe bought the Shifa plant in March. Officials say U.S. intelligence \\nhas received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic \\ngroups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is \\n40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government \\nentity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons \\ndevelopment. Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial \\nCorp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, \\nand talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against \\nU.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence. But Pendry \\ndenied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial \\nCorp. U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details about \\nthe reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad. \\nBut they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin \\nLaden's terrorist campaign. \\n\\nThe Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday \\nof looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his \\nwar-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man \\nWashington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of \\nU.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an \\ninterview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States \\nretaliated by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps \\nin eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According to U.S. intelligence \\nsources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's \\nal Qaeda terrorist group. ``America is looking for an excuse to fire \\nmore rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' \\nSaqib said. Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for \\nbin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan. \\nSaqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to \\ninvestigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United \\nStates has become insecure. ``America fears its shadow ... in every \\npart of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to \\nbin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. \\nIn Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban \\nhosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demands the host guarantee \\nhis guest protection. So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin \\nLaden's involvement in terrorist activities. The Taliban have refused \\nto turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there \\nis evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent \\nof Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice \\nhas been imposed, including the death penalty. ``We want good relations \\nwith the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, but \\nthey have to respect our ways,'' he said. Saqib said his inquiry will \\nwind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the \\ncase will be closed _ at least for the Taliban. ``Bin Laden is not \\na sinful man ... America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' \\nhe said. ``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that \\nworld to have no reason to go after bin Laden.'' \\n\\nOne of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on \\nAfghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants \\nas possible, administration officials now acknowledge. According to \\nthe officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the \\nmonths before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal \\nunder U.S. and international law. The officials said the raid was \\ntimed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps \\nat the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would \\nbe meeting there with his chief operatives. A 1976 executive order \\nbars anyone working for the U.S. government from plotting or carrying \\nout assassinations. But officials said the White House legal opinion \\ndrafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority \\nto target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking \\nAmericans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official said this week that \\nthe infrastructure of bin Laden's group is mostly ``human.'' ``As \\nwe said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to \\ndisrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden \\nterrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman \\nfor the National Security Council at the White House. Targeting infrastructure, \\nofficials acknowledged, can also mean destroying the leadership of \\na terrorist group. ``Command and control of an enemy is a justifiable \\ntarget,'' Leavy said. Senior administration officials said they never \\ndiscussed killing bin Laden in their planning sessions. His death, \\nthey said in interviews after the attack, would simply have been a \\nside benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that \\nbin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears \\nto have left unscathed before the missiles hit. Officials said there \\nwere reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have \\ndied in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were \\nbetween 50 and 100. Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction \\nbetween attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking \\na group of people who command a terrorist organization. Administration \\nofficials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill \\nbin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors \\nwith leading a global war against U.S. interests. He has been linked \\nto the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. But a \\nless subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary \\nWilliam Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United \\nStates had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues. ``We \\nweren't quite successful,'' Cohen continued, ``but we sent a message.'' \\nKenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the secretary had not \\nretracted his statements. The Los Angeles Times recently reported \\nthat the administration believed that it had a legal right to use \\ndeadly force against terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization was \\na significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the \\nbombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa. Last spring, officials \\nsaid, U.S. intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan \\nto capture the Saudi exile. Officials said that at roughly the same \\ntime, the White House drafted the legal justification for military \\nattacks against a terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, \\nprovided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the \\nmeeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would \\nbe gathered. The review, by the National Security Council, was the \\nbasis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order \\nbanning assassinations. That ban was imposed by President Ford in \\n1975, after congressional investigators uncovered evidence that the \\nCIA had plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and \\nothers. The order said: ``No person employed by, or acting on behalf \\nof the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage \\nin, assassination.'' While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified \\nban, it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over \\nthe years. In 1986, the Reagan administration responded to a terrorist \\nattack against U.S. soldiers in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya. \\nThe targets included the residence of the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. \\nAnd in the Gulf War, U.S. forces used powerful bombs in an attempt \\nto kill Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq. The legal review conducted \\nby the White House would appear to provide a precedent for future \\noperations in similar circumstances. \\n\", \"\\nA liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next \\nelections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said. \\nGalina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament \\nfrom the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked the entry \\nway of an apartment building, police said. A neighbor found the body \\nin a pool of blood late Friday night and called an ambulance, they \\nsaid. The Interfax news agency said her aide, Ruslan Linkov, was also \\nseriously injured. Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in \\nthe 1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical \\nreasons. She had said she would run again in 2000. She served as President \\nBoris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues and was on the human rights \\ncommittee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. Born in the Ural Mountains \\ncity of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was trained as a psychologist and \\nlater received a doctorate in history. She was divorced and had one \\nson, according to Who's Who in Russia. There have been several attacks \\non prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official \\nwas attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, \\nand an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last \\nmonth. \\n\\nMourners bearing flowers and candles gathered Sunday outside the house \\non Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, \\nwas shot to death on Friday night. A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, \\nMrs. Staravoitova's press aide, was reported to be regaining consciousness \\nin a heavily guarded hospital ward where he was taken with gunshot \\nwounds to the head and neck. The police say the two were attacked \\nin the stairwell of Mrs. Staravoitova's building by two assailants, \\none of them a young woman. The attackers reportedly fled through a \\nback entrance to a waiting car. Two guns were found at the scene. \\nFriends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of Russia's \\ndemocratic movement, had received death threats, but the motive for \\nthe killing remains unclear. ``The choice of the target suggests a \\nwell-thought out plan,'' said Sergei Kozyrev, vice president of the \\nRussian Association of Scientific Societies and a Staravoitova supporter. \\n``To kill a woman _ a woman in politics _ that has not happened in \\nRussia since Stalin's time.'' Setting aside past feuds, local democratic \\ngroups said Sunday that they would unite in coming elections to the \\nSt. Petersburg city council, combining their forces against what they \\nsay are criminals who have invaded local politics. At a gathering \\nSunday night in Moscow, Yegor Gaidar, a former Russian prime minister \\nand a close ally of Mrs. Staravoitova, bitterly rejected suggestions \\nthat Russia should adopt extraordinary security measures to stem the \\nrise in political crime. \\n\\nA liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next \\nelections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. \\nGalina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament \\nfrom the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment \\nbuilding along with her aide, the Interfax news agency reported. It \\ngave no other details. Starovoitova tried to run for president in \\nthe 1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical \\nreasons. She had said she would run again in 2000. There have been \\nseveral attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg in recent months. \\n\\nThe New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: The Russian \\nreform movement has produced few leaders with an uncompromising dedication \\nto democracy. Galina Starovoitova was one, and her murder in St. Petersburg \\non Friday was a terrible loss for Russia. In a bleak season of economic \\ncollapse and political timidity, the killing can only heighten fears \\nthat Russia is slipping into an ugly era of intolerance and political \\nviolence. Initial evidence suggests that the killing was a political \\nassassination. Ms. Starovoitova was gunned down in the lobby of her \\napartment building, shot three times in the head, typical of Russian \\ncontract killings. She was a member of the Russian parliament and \\na recently declared candidate for governor of the region around St. \\nPetersburg. In recent weeks she had spoken out forcefully against \\npolitical extremism, denounced the anti-Semitic statements of a Communist \\nparliamentarian and was campaigning aggressively against financial \\ncorruption in the St. Petersburg municipal government. Ms. Starovoitova's \\nactivities were fully in character with a career built around principles \\nof liberty, tolerance and the rule of law. She championed democracy \\nand human rights long before they became politically acceptable in \\nMoscow, and courageously stood by Boris Yeltsin and other reformers \\nas Russia struggled to find a new political course when the Soviet \\nUnion disintegrated. An ethnographer by training, Ms. Starovoitova \\nproved to be a skillful and effective politician. She first gained \\nnational attention a decade ago when she set aside her academic work \\nabout the ethnic history of Leningrad and ran successfully for a seat \\nin the Soviet parliament from Armenia, a startling victory for a Russian. \\nShe later represented St. Petersburg in the Russian legislature. Ms. \\nStarovoitova was a woman of irrepressible energy and infectious enthusiasm. \\nBut her good humor and quick smile belied a steely commitment to combat \\nthe corruption and ethnic divisions that she correctly considered \\nto be the enemies of Russian democracy. The least Yeltsin can do is \\nto hunt down her killers and bring them to trial. That would be the \\nexception in a nation where political violence is rarely prosecuted. \\nHer countrymen can honor her memory by following her example. \\n\\nA liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next \\nelections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said. \\nGalina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament \\nfrom the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked the entry \\nway of an apartment building, police said.

A finance official \\nwas attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, \\nand an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last \\nmonth. \\n\\nHundreds of people gathered Saturday to mourn the shooting death of \\none of Russia's most prominent women, a potential presidential candidate \\nwhose killing was widely considered to be politically motivated. President \\nBoris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the investigation \\ninto the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down Friday \\nnight as she climbed the stairs to her apartment. An aide was also \\nshot and critically wounded. The shooting occurred in a building along \\nSt. Petersburg's atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious \\nRussian crime _ the murder that was the central event in Fyodor Dostoevsky's \\n19th century masterpiece, ``Crime and Punishment.'' Like that fictional \\ncrime, which shone a light on social ferment in the St. Petersburg \\nof its day, the death of Starovoitova was immediately seized upon \\nas a seminal event in the Russia of the late 1990s. ``It is one of \\nthe black pages in our modern history,'' Vladimir Putin, director \\nof the Federal Security Service (FSB) told the Interfax news agency. \\n``It doesn't do much to improve our reputation, the reputation of \\nthe country as a whole.'' Starovoitova, 52, was an outspoken deputy \\nin the lower house of parliament who inspired strong feelings from \\nboth her friends and enemies. A leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic \\nChoice party, she was planning to run for president in 2000. Those \\nclose to her speculated about who might have wanted her dead, with \\nsome naming various prominent politicians as potential culprits. ``Whose \\npath did she cross? The answer is simple: communists and gangsters,'' \\nsaid former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais. ``These are the \\ntwo kinds of people in whose way she was standing.'' Putin, whose \\nagency is in charge of the investigation, cautioned that there was \\nstill no evidence that her death was a political assassination. Interior \\nMinister Sergei Stepashin did not speculate about the motive for the \\ncrime, but told reporters that it was being investigated under a criminal \\ncode section that covers terrorism. Arriving at the St. Petersburg \\nairport from Moscow, he said: ``I brought with me a team of experienced \\ninvestigators. I think we will clear it up soon.'' Yeltsin sent a \\ntelegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of parliament's lower house, \\nthe State Duma, promising that the ``contractors and executors of \\nthe murder will be found and severely punished,'' The president also \\nsent a telegram to Starovoitova's family, in which he called her ``one \\nof the most vivid figures in Russian politics,'' who ``consistently \\nupheld the lofty ideals of freedom and democracy.'' More than 200 \\npeople gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square to remember Starovoitova. \\nPeople hugged quietly as they listened to speeches by her fellow politicians \\nand friends. The small stage was adorned with red roses, yellow carnations \\nand photographs of the deputy with various people, including the late \\nRussian physicist and dissident, Andrei Sakharov. ``We are united \\ntoday by pain, which is bigger than politics,'' said Viktor Krivulin, \\na poet and candidate for the regional legislature. ``Politics, as \\nI felt during the past night, has become the art of spitting on the \\nsoul.'' Others at the gathering said they were sure that Starovoitova \\nwas killed by those who disliked her outspoken views. ``She had too \\nmany enemies,'' said Galina Markelova, an aide to the lawmaker. She \\nsaid Starovoitova had received many threats in the past. ``It was \\ndoubtless a political murder,'' added Vitaly Milonov, the chairman \\nof the Young Christian Democrats. Police said two men followed Starovoitova \\nand her aide, Ruslan Linkov, 27, and shot them on the stairs of her \\nbuilding Friday evening. Linkov was shot twice. He regained consciousness \\nafter a five-hour operation at the Military Medical Academy, but remained \\nin critical condition in intensive care. A pistol with a silencer \\nand and automatic rifle were found at the scene, ITAR-Tass said. A \\nfuneral is scheduled for Tuesday in the settlement of Gorelovo, near \\nSt. Petersburg. \\n\\nIn modern Russia, the crime was so common as to be mundane. Two thugs, \\narmed with machine pistols and silencers, stalked and killed a powerful \\nfigure, then slipped away into the night. Police vowed to catch them \\nand politicians expressed outrage. Usually, that would be the end \\nof the story. This time, though, the figure shot was one of the most \\nprominent and popular women in Russian politics, a prospective presidential \\ncandidate with friends in the highest reaches of the Kremlin. As outrage \\nmounted Sunday, it seemed clear that the killing of Galina Starovoitova \\nwas not going to be treated as a routine crime, and some said it might \\nturn out to be a watershed event in Russian politics. ``This is impossible \\nto tolerate any longer,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko, \\nanother reform-oriented party. ``We must stop feeling powerless before \\nthe increasingly cheeky scum. We cannot go on living as though everything \\nis running as usual.'' Starovoitova, a member of parliament and a \\nleader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was walking \\nup the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young \\naide Friday evening. A team of assailants _ police believe it was \\na man and a woman _ appeared behind them and opened fire. Starovoitova, \\nshot three times in the head, collapsed and died instantly, authorities \\nsaid. The aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was critically wounded, \\nbut managed to telephone a news agency reporter before losing consciousness. \\nPolice have recovered two guns, and are hoping that Linkov can provide \\na description of the killers. He had regained consciousness but still \\ncould not speak Sunday. Although it was still not clear who killed \\nStarovoitova or why, the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract \\nhit _ a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. Most of the \\nkillings involve business deals and the corruption that has swamped \\nthe government and the economy. Until now, the most notorious of the \\nkillings was that of popular television host Vladislav Litsyev, who \\nwas shot outside his Moscow home in 1995. But there have been hundreds \\nof others. St. Petersburg has been especially plagued. Last year, \\nthe city's deputy governor was gunned down on a central St. Petersburg \\nstreet. In the past two months alone, hitmen have claimed the lives \\nof a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent \\nbanker. So deeply has the toxin infected Russian society that President \\nBoris Yeltsin ordered an investigation last week into reports that \\nhis Federal Security Service _ the domestic successor to the KGB _ \\nhad ordered the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most prominent \\nbusinessman and the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States. \\nThere is no indication that anyone attempted to carry out an assassination \\nof Berezovsky. But Yeltsin's order was the equivalent of U.S. President \\nBill Clinton ordering an investigation into whether the FBI was plotting \\nto kill Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. Yet, as remarkable as that \\nnews was, it has been vastly overshadowed by the death of Starovoitova. \\nTelevision news since her death has carried reports of little else. \\nReaction has poured in from virtually every important figure in the \\ncountry, and from surrounding nations. Yeltsin, calling her ``my comrade,'' \\ndeclared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her \\ndeath. There was, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death, \\nthe sense that a line had been crossed. Perhaps it was because she \\nwas a woman, perhaps because she elicited impassioned support, or \\nperhaps because people are simply fed up. But, in more characteristic \\nfashion, her death also led to a round of political finger-pointing. \\nColleagues of Starovoitova declared _ without any apparent evidence \\n_ that her Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, \\nwere the most likely culprits in her death. Historian Dmitry Likachyov, \\none of the nation's most revered and trusted figures, said her killing \\nseemed to signal the ``outburst of a new Red Terror.'' By late Saturday, \\nthe name-calling had gone so far that Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin \\ncalled a news conference to say there was no evidence that the Communist \\nspeaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, was involved in the killing. \\nSeleznyov went on television to say he was saddened by her death. \\n``But,'' he added, ``I would not like the deputies who sat on the \\nsame bench with Galina Starovoitova in the State Duma ... to turn \\nthis into a political show.'' It is too early to know where the recriminations \\nand political maneuvering will lead. For now, the only thing certain \\nis the Starovoitova has become the latest in a long line of Russian \\nmartyrs. \\n\\nA badly wounded aide to a murdered lawmaker regained consciousness \\nMonday and was talking to police, who later arrested several suspects \\nin raids around the city, officials said. Galina Starovoitova, 52, \\na leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was shot \\ndead by unidentified assailants on the stairs of her apartment building \\nin St. Petersburg on Friday night. The killing of such a prominent \\npolitician has caused an uproar in Russia and prompted calls from \\nall sides for a crackdown on the country's growing lawlessness. Scores \\nof business leaders and others have been gunned down in recent years \\nin contract killings that are almost never solved. The lawmaker's \\naide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was in a ``clear'' mind Monday, testifying \\nto investigators, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Special police \\narmed with assault rifles were standing guard at the door of his hospital \\nroom. Acting on information from the aide, police carried out raids \\nand rounded up several suspects, officials said. There were no further \\ndetails. Linkov was critically wounded in the head during the attack \\nand later rushed to a hospital where he underwent surgery during the \\nweekend. Liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete evidence _ \\nthat Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of \\nparliament, were the most likely culprits. Over the weekend, Interior \\nMinister Sergei Stepashin even had to call a news conference to say \\nthere was no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady \\nSeleznyov, was involved in the killing. Seleznyov responded in kind \\non Monday, suggesting that the ``extremists from democratic organizations'' \\nmight have staged the murder in order to win local elections set for \\nDec. 6, the Interfax news agency reported. The speaker also threatened \\nto file a libel suit against a St. Petersburg newspaper, which Starovoitova \\nedited. The newspaper recently accused Seleznyov of setting up an \\nillegal fund to finance a presidential bid and other shady activities. \\nSeleznyov, who has said he might run for president in 2000, denied \\nthe newspaper's allegations on Friday, calling them an ``outright \\nslander.'' Starovoitova's murder had all the traits of a contract \\nmurder, an increasingly common crime in Russia. Communist leader Gennady \\nZyuganov on Monday used Starovoitova's killing as an occasion to lambast \\nthe government for its inability to contain soaring crime. ``That's \\na result of the (government's) catastrophic policy aimed at the destruction \\nof the state and the nation,'' he said. Starovoitova, of the reformist \\nparty Democratic Russia, tried to run for president in 1996 but her \\nregistration was turned down for technical reasons. She had said she \\nwould run again in 2000. She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide \\non ethnic issues in 1991-92 _ the only woman in his immediate circle \\n_ and later joined the Russian parliament as one of the most vocal \\ndefenders of liberal reforms. Yeltsin called Starovoitova a ``comrade'' \\nand said he would personally monitor the investigation into her killing. \\nStarovoitova remarried earlier this year and had one son and a grandson. \\nShe is scheduled to be buried on Tuesday at the Nikolskoye cemetery \\nin St. Petersburg. \\n\\nA liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next \\nelections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. \\nGalina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament \\nfrom the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment \\nbuilding along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the Interfax news agency \\nreported. Linkov was seriously injured, it said. The report gave no \\nother details. A police spokesman in St. Petersburg would not comment \\non the report. Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in the \\n1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical \\nreasons. She had said she would run again in 2000. She served as President \\nBoris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues and was on the human rights \\ncommittee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. Born in the Ural Mountains \\ncity of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was trained as a psychologist and \\nlater received a doctorate in history. She was divorced and had one \\nson, according to Who's Who in Russia. There have been several attacks \\non prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official \\nwas attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, \\nand an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last \\nmonth. \\n\\nA slain Russian lawmaker was honored Tuesday as a martyr to democratic \\nideals in a stately funeral service in which anger mingled freely \\nwith tears. Afterward, Galina Starovoitova was to be buried alongside \\nsome of Russia's greatest national heroes. The stirring tribute to \\nStarovoitova, a feisty liberal whose killing remains a mystery, was \\nindicative of the depth of national feeling over her death. ``To stop \\nus, they want to scare us. They will never succeed,'' former Deputy \\nPrime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at the funeral for Starovoitova. \\n``We will fulfill the goals she sacrificed her life for.'' Hundreds \\nof people, including many of the country's most prominent political \\nfigures, packed the grand Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's Ethnography \\nMuseum for the funeral. An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons \\nand flanked by a military honor guard, stood at the head of the hall. \\nAt the end of the service, mourners passed grimly past it as classical \\nmusic played. Outside, several thousand more mourners stood in the \\ncold, waiting for the service to end so they could file in and pay \\ntheir respects. ``Ordinary people should honor her memory, and make \\nsure this never happens again,'' said one man, Vadim Olshevsky, the \\nmanager of a construction company. But, he added bitterly, ``There's \\nlittle hope of that in our country.'' Among speakers at the service \\nwere former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President \\nBoris Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff, who represented the president \\nat the service. Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was also present. \\nYeltsin, who has said he will personally oversee the investigation \\ninto Starovoitova's killing, was in a Moscow hospital, recovering \\nfrom pneumonia. ``The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson \\nfor the whole of Russia,'' Yarov said. ``Irrespective of real motives \\nfor that murder, a crime of this magnitude is a political act, and \\nsociety should know all the truth about it.'' One national television \\nchannel turned over its daylong programming to funeral coverage and \\na memorial tribute. Newspapers carried page after page of coverage \\nof her death. Her political party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called \\non all Russians to turn out their lights in her memory for three minutes \\nat 8 p.m. Tuesday. Starovoitova was initially going to be buried in \\na simple cemetery in the St. Petersburg suburb where her family lives. \\nBut as outrage mounted over her killing, the government announced \\nthat she would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the \\ncity's center following the funeral at the Ethnography Museum. Among \\nthose buried at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery are the composers Peter \\nTchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky and the author Fyodor Dostoevsky. \\nStarovoitova was shot to death Friday evening as she and an aide scaled \\nthe stairs to her apartment in St. Petersburg. The aide, 27-year-old \\nRuslan Linkov, was seriously wounded, but has been able to provide \\nsome description of the shooting to police. Acting on his information, \\ninvestigators rounded up several suspects, officials said Monday. \\nBut a detective later said that investigators had learned nothing \\n``serious'' from Linkov, according to the Interfax news agency, and \\nthere were no further details about whether the suspects were still \\nin custody. Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigations for the Interior \\nMinistry, told Interfax on Tuesday that he was confident the case \\nwould be solved. ``It will take time,'' he said, but added that investigators \\n``have tips, they have something to work on.'' Authorities are acting \\non the assumption that Starovoitova's death was a contract hit, a \\ncommon event in post-Soviet Russia. Russian politicians and newspapers \\nhave speculated wildly about political motives for the killing, but \\npolice have said they have no idea why someone would have wanted her \\ndead. Police said someone fired shots at the apartment of a member \\nof the St. Petersburg legislature Monday night, Interfax said. No \\none was hurt. It was not clear whether the shooting was related to \\nStarovoitova's death. \\n\", \"\\nParliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence \\nmotion that could bring down the government over an organized crime \\nscandal. Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an \\nindication of the government's chances of survival, which are said \\nto be extremely slim. If approved, the legislature will debate the \\nmotions on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday. The opposition \\naccuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having ties to organized crime \\nand tampering with the privatization of a state bank. He denies the \\ncharges. ``Ousting the government from power will open the way for \\nthe struggle against gangs,'' said Lutfu Esengun, a deputy from the \\nIslamic Virtue Party, which presented one of the three no-confidence \\nmotions to Parliament. On Wednesday, 6th graf pvs \\n\\nTurkey's latest premier-designate got the backing of two key secular \\nparties Monday in his efforts to form a broad-based, coalition government, \\non condition that his government stick to Turkey's secular principles. \\nThe Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support \\nfor Yalim Erez. News reports said Virtue was holding out for a number \\nof Cabinet seats that reflected its standing as the largest party \\nin parliament. ``We are neither saying `yes' nor saying `no' at this \\npoint,'' Virtue leader Recai Kutan said. Erez denied that the two \\nhad discussed Cabinet posts. Erez, an independent lawmaker, is trying \\nto form a coalition government that would include Cabinet members \\nfrom several parties, including Virtue. The coalition would run the \\ncountry only until parliamentary elections set for April. Erez took \\nover efforts to form a government last week after veteran leftist \\nBulent Ecevit gave up, unable to convince Turkey's bickering center-left \\nand center-right parties to join him in a coalition that excluded \\nthe Islamic-oriented party. Erez opened talks with various party leaders \\non Monday. He got support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who \\nsaid his party supported Erez as long as he had Ecevit's backing. \\n``As long as our sensitivity toward the secular, democratic regime \\nis taken into account, we will do our best to help form the new government \\nand ensure it gets a vote of confidence,'' Ecevit said after his own \\ntalks with Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military is opposed to \\nany deal that would bring Virtue to power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, \\nthe Welfare Party, out of power last year. Erez is supposed to talk \\nTuesday to center-right Tansu Ciller and to Deniz Baykal, who leads \\na center-left party. ``I am more and more optimistic after every meeting,'' \\nErez told reporters after meeting with the party leaders. Turkey has \\nbeen trying to form a new government since a coalition government \\nled by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged \\nthe sale of a bank. Yilmaz is now acting premier. \\n\\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday faced \\nintense pressure to step down after allegations that he interfered \\nin a privatization contract and helped a businessman linked to a mobster \\nsecure loans. Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party \\nwhose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said \\nhe would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately. \\nTwo opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to censure \\nthe government. The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, \\nwho claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had \\nencouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans \\nfrom other state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid. \\nYigit's allegations were carried Tuesday night on two of his TV channels \\nwhich showed a videotape he had made to explain his version of the \\nstory before his detention Monday evening for questioning about the \\nbidding. Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs \\n600 million. The government suspended the privatization last month \\nafter a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation supposedly \\nbetween Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici. On that earlier tape, Cakici \\nwas heard assuring Yigit that he will fend off rival bidders. It was \\nnot clear who made the tape, which got into the hands of an opposition \\ndeputy. Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's involvement \\nin the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless to go ahead \\nwith the bidding. Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing \\nYigit's ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender. \\nYigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy mass-circulation \\nnational newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure the paper's backing \\nto his center-right Motherland party in elections next year. Milliyet's \\nsale to Yigit was canceled after the scandal. Cakici was arrested \\nin France in August. Turkey has requested his extradition. Last month \\nState Minister Eyup Asik resigned after allegations he had been in \\nclose contact with Cakici. \\n\\nA week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, \\nPresident Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing \\npolitician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form \\na new government. Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times \\nin the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a \\ngovernment that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. \\nHe also suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 as the \\ndate for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a longer \\nperiod. ``It is wrong to see this government as simply an election \\ngovernment,'' he said. ``There are problems that will not wait until \\nan election.'' Military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, \\nhave quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that \\nthey do not want a quick election. They fear it will produce a Parliament \\njust as divided as the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented \\nVirtue Party as the largest bloc. The commanders are also hoping to \\nexclude two of the country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister \\nMesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom \\nthey trust, from posts in the new government. Ecevit must now try \\nto build a government that includes their center-right parties but \\nnot them as individuals. In a meeting this week the country's senior \\npolicy-making body, the National Security Council, in which military \\nofficers have a strong say, set three priorities for the coming months. \\nIt said that whatever government emerges from forthcoming negotiations \\nshould dedicate itself to fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish \\nnationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrated the state apparatus. \\nAmong Ecevit's immediate challenges will be to resolve a political \\ncrisis with Italy that broke out last month when the Kurdish rebel \\nleader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in Rome and then asked for political \\nasylum there. Turkey wants Ocalan sent here for trial, but Italy says \\nit cannot extradite him as long as Turkey retains the death penalty. \\nEcevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) is among the few senior Turkish politicians \\nwho favors the abolition of capital punishment. Together with Demirel, \\nEcevit is often cited by Turks who complain about the continued dominance \\nof a geriatric political elite here. He is 73 and has been in politics \\nfor most of his adult life. Early in his career Ecevit emerged as \\na spokesman for Turkey's downtrodden masses. Perhaps more than any \\nother figure, he legitimized social democratic ideology in a climate \\nwhere leftist sympathies were often considered subversive. At the \\nsame time, however, he has shown himself to be a fierce nationalist. \\nHe was prime minister when Turkey sent troops to occupy northern Cyprus \\nin 1974 and is still considered a hard-liner on Cyprus. He is also \\nuncompromising in his opposition to Kurdish nationalism. During his \\nterms as prime minister in the 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined \\nefforts to move Turkey toward membership in the European Union, then \\ncalled the European Economic Community. He considered it an instrument \\nof capitalist exploitation. Ecevit has also disturbed the United States \\nby flirting with anti-Western ideologies. In the early 1990s, during \\nan interval when he worked as a journalist, he traveled to Iraq and \\nwrote a series of articles favorable to Saddam Hussein. He recently \\ncalled for better relations between Turkey and Iraq, and maintains \\nsome of the anti-imperialist positions and suspicion of capitalism \\nthat he developed in the 1960s. The Democratic Socialist Party, which \\nEcevit heads, is a closely held family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully \\nscreen applicants for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty \\nto Ecevit is suspect. ``During his terms as prime minister in the \\n'70s, Ecevit did not appear to be a consensus builder,'' said Ilter \\nTuran, a professor of political science at Bilgi University in Istanbul. \\n``It seems that nowadays he is more accommodating, so from that perspective \\nhe may not be bad choice.'' ``On many issues that Turkish society \\nis encountering now, he represents an orientation which does not seem \\nto be totally in tune with the times,'' Turan said. ``That would include \\nhis position on issues like privatization, integrating Turkey more \\nfully into the international system, and the devolution of central \\nauthority. He has failed to grasp where the world is heading. He looks \\nat and analyzes the world in categories that are no longer useful \\nor appropriate.'' Almost alone among Turkish politicians, Ecevit lives \\nmodestly and has avoided any hint of personal or financial scandal. \\nHe speaks fluent English, and his reading tastes run to poetry and \\nintellectual journals such as The New York Review of Books. He has \\ntranslated the works of T.S. Eliot into Turkish and published several \\nvolumes of his own poems. \\n\\nBulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday, is \\na former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of \\nCyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home. The invasion, \\nafter a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece, has led \\nto the division of the island. Throughout the years, Ecevit, 73, has \\nremained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots ``As \\nlong as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination \\nof Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots,'' he said in July \\n1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion. Ecevit, \\nwho was prime minister three times since 1974, has over the years \\nshed some of the socialist idealism he was known for in the 70s. During \\nhis tenure as deputy prime minister in a 17-month government that \\nwas toppled last week over a corruption scandal, he gave his backing \\nto the liberal policies of the center-right-led coalition. He often \\nsaid he was carrying out a duty to bring a stable government and spare \\nTurkey from crisis - a reference to tensions between a previous Islamic-led \\ngovernment and the secular military. Though never a Marxist, Ecevit \\nwas in his early years viewed with suspicion by big business for espousing \\nsocialism based on heavy government social benefits and a strong role \\nfor the state sector in the economy. Recently, however, he has helped \\nthe government keep on good terms with the IMF, which ordered a strict \\ncurb on public spending, and approved a number of state sell-offs. \\nUnder his leadership in the 70's, ties with the United States were \\ntense. He has also expressed concern over a U.S.-led multinational \\nforce based in Turkey that monitors a no-fly zone over Kurdish-controlled \\nnorthern Iraq. He argues it it is helping create a Kurdish state. \\nHis frequent visits to Iraq to meet with President Saddam Hussein \\nhave in turn raised suspicion in Washington. Despite a short alliance \\nwith an Islamic party in 1974, he is a staunch defender of Turkey's \\nsecular traditions and pushed for a crackdown on Islamic radicalism. \\nEcevit was born in Istanbul in 1925, to an intellectual family and \\nstudied literature at a prestigious American-run high school. He has \\ntaken some courses at Harvard University. A former journalist, he \\nentered politics in 1957, rising to the leadership of the Republican \\nPeople's Party in 1972, becoming prime minister in 1974, briefly in \\n1977 and again in 1978-79. He was barred from politics in the years \\nthat followed a 1980 military coup. He was imprisoned three times \\nfor carrying on with political activities despite the ban, mainly \\nthrough his wife of 51 years, Rahsan, who formed the Democratic Left \\nParty in 1985 and led it until a democratic reform in 1987 allowed \\nEcevit back into politics. In corruption-tainted Turkish politics, \\nhe remains known as the leader with the cleanest slate. Not even his \\nalliance with Yilmaz who was ousted for alleged ties to the mob and \\nrigging the privatization of a bank, tarnished his image. \\n\\nPremier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist in \\nthe difficult task of convincing a key party leader to join forces \\nin a secular coalition. Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government \\nWednesday, desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier \\nTansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, already \\nhas the support of another center-right party led by Mesut Yilmaz, \\nwhose government collapsed last week under the weight of a mafia scandal. \\nMrs. Ciller has not said if she would back an Ecevit-led government \\nand her long-standing rivalry with Yilmaz makes Ecevit's job of coalition-building \\ndifficult. ``I don't give up that easily, neither do I lose hope that \\neasily,'' Ecevit told his parliamentary group Thursday. Mrs. Ciller \\ncould lose grassroot support if she stands in the way of a new government, \\npolitical columnist Ertugrul Ozkok wrote Thursday in daily Hurriyet. \\n``This could put her at odds with her classic support base.'' Ecevit \\nwas expected to meet with Yilmaz on Thursday, and other party leaders \\nFriday. Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces \\nto keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power. Virtue is the largest \\nparty in Parliament, but the all-powerful military is fiercely opposed \\nto an Islamic-led government. \\n\\nThe chances for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey faded \\nWednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the \\nIslamic party a share of power. The military, self-appointed guardians \\nof Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion \\nof Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament. Premier-designate \\nBulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together \\na secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands \\n99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday. Ecevit already has \\nthe support of her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head \\nof the other center-right party. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she \\nwould not join forces with Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. \\n25 over a mafia scandal. Instead, she reiterated her demand for a \\ngovernment that would include Virtue. ``We do not oppose Mr. Ecevit's \\npremiership. We will support him, but only if all parties represented \\nin Parliament are included,'' Mrs. Ciller said. It was not clear what \\nEcevit's next move would be. He might try to form a fragile minority \\ncoalition. He might also admit defeat and return the task of forming \\nthe government to President Suleyman Demirel. Demirel could then choose \\nany member of parliament to head the government until elections in \\nApril. \\n\\nAfter failing to bring together political rivals in a coalition, Premier-designate \\nBulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he was returning his mandate \\nto the Turkish president. In a statement reported by the Anatolia \\nnews agency, Ecevit said he would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday \\nmorning. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet \\nover two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed \\nin a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Deputies accused Yilmaz, who \\nhas since been serving as acting premier, of entertaining ties with \\nthe mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank. Refusing any \\nalliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party \\nin Parliament, Ecevit was unable to create a political alliance strong \\nenough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divided legislature. \\nEcevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival \\ncenter-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former \\nPrime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate efforts to make a \\nminority coalition with outside backing for his Democratic Left Party \\nfrom Parliament also failed. Demirel will now have to either ask someone \\nelse to try to form a government or wait until Jan. 10, when the constitution \\nallows him to appoint a caretaker cabinet to lead the country to parliamentary \\nelections, now scheduled for April. Such a cabinet would not have \\nto face a confidence vote. Or Demirel could choose to leave the current \\ncaretaker government, headed by Yilmaz, in power until the elections. \\n\\nOpposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against \\nPrime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the \\nprivatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster. \\nYilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left \\nRepublican Party, which usually gives him the majority he needs in \\nparliament, votes against him. The leader of the Republicans, Deniz \\nBaykal, urged Yilmaz to resign. But the premier vowed Wednesday to \\nstay on, saying he was the victim of a conspiracy. ``This is a plot \\nand it can't be a reason for a resignation,'' Yilmaz said, adding \\nthat he intended to continue the ``struggle against organized crime.'' \\nAfterward, Baykal said the Republicans would support a no-confidence \\nmotion. The leader of the Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, \\nsaid his party might withdraw from the governing coalition. He said \\nthe party would announce its decision Thursday. The political turmoil \\nsent the Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent. \\n\\nPresident Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely \\ntrusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran \\npolitician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political \\nleaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition. Bulent Ecevit of \\nthe Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a \\ngovernment that could command a majority of votes in Parliament. ``It \\nis now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win \\na vote of confidence,'' former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks \\nwith Demirel. ``We have told the president that we will not hamper \\nthe appointment of a deputy of Parliament.'' With party leaders unable \\nto overcome differences, the new premier-designate would most probably \\nbe affiliated to a party but be trusted enough by other parties to \\nfollow an independent line. Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin has been \\nsuggested as a likely candidate. The new appointment would be made \\nwithin days, Yilmaz told reporters. Demirel consulted Turkey's party \\nleaders immediately after Ecevit gave up. Most declared themselves \\nin favor of a government led by a lawmaker. Only center-right leader \\nTansu Ciller said she wanted a government led by a party leader, and \\nmade clear she was willing to take on the task. Turkey's parliament \\nis split by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right \\nparties. Yilmaz led the last government, which collapsed in November \\namid allegations he had ties to organized crime and interfered with \\nthe sale of a state bank. By tradition, Demirel should then have asked \\nthe leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government. \\nBut Demirel broke with custom to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue \\nParty from power. Turkey's staunchly secular military opposes the \\nreturn of an Islamic-led government. Modern Turkey has had only one \\nIslamic-led government, formed after 1995 elections, and the military \\npressured it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular \\ntraditions. Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the \\nVirtue Party during his efforts to form a government. \\n\", \"\\nChina's central government ordered the arrest of a prominent democracy \\ncampaigner and may use his contacts with exiled Chinese dissidents \\nto charge him with harming national security, a colleague said Wednesday. \\nTwo Beijing police officers spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguo to \\nstop trying to set up a political opposition party. Underscoring the \\nwarning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released soon \\nand may be charged for having links to ``reactionary groups,'' Zha \\nsaid. Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested \\nMonday night in police raids in two cities that delivered the sternest \\nblow so far to a five-month campaign to establish the China Democracy \\nParty and challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. \\nQin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a crime \\nthat could land him in jail for life. A third Democracy Party advocate, \\nWang Youcai, already in custody for a month, was also formally arrested \\nMonday although his family has not been informed of the charges. Zha, \\nwho helped Xu organize would-be party members in Beijing and the nearby \\nport of Tianjin, said police officers told him Xu's arrest was ordered \\nby the central government, not Beijing police. He took the police \\nreference to ``reactionary groups'' to mean exiled dissidents in the \\nUnited States. Under China's vague State Security Law, such links \\nmay also be punishable by up to life in prison. Zha pledged to work \\nwith dissidents in China and exiles in the United States to campaign \\n``to save Xu Wenli.'' On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the \\ncountry demanded in an open letter that the government release Xu, \\nQin and Wang Youcai, saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human \\nrights treaties China has signed over the past 14 months. The authorities \\n``are deceiving and cheating international public opinion while on \\nthe other hand they are suppressing and persecuting domestic political \\ndissidents,'' said the letter faxed to foreign news agencies. In Washington, \\nWhite House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored \\nthe detention and arrests of Xu and Qin. ``We believe the peaceful \\npolitical activities of this kind and other forms of peaceful expression \\nthat they've been involved in are fundamental human rights that should \\nbe protected by all governments,'' Lockart said. ``We call on the \\nChinese government to assure the protection in these cases of Mr. \\nXu and Mr. Qin.'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. \\nofficials conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign \\nAffairs and urged that Xu be released immediately. U.S. officials \\nreceived confirmation Wednesday that Xu is being detained on suspicion \\nof ``having conducted activities damaging to China's national security,'' \\nRubin said. He said he had no information from Chinese authorities \\nabout Qin or Wang. Two other democracy party supporters taken into \\ncustody in central Wuhan city along with Qin _ Chen Zhonghe and Xiao \\nShichang _ were released Wednesday morning, said He Xintong, Xu Wenli's \\nwife. She added that police questioned the pair about the party as \\nwell as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations. Qin and Xu are \\ntowering figures in China's persecuted dissident community. Their \\nactivism dates to the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the 1970s. \\nWang was a student leader in 1989's influential Tiananmen Square democracy \\nmovement. All have spent time in prison, Xu for 12 years, much of \\nit in solitary confinement. Xu's wife said she does not know where \\nhe is being held and, in her 20-year experience with the authorities, \\nbelieves they are unlikely to tell her. Released in 1993, Xu picked \\nup his campaigning for political change soon after his parole ended \\nlast year. He has tried to use China's nascent legal system and the \\ninternational treaties it signed to push for reform. ``My husband \\nis innocent and there's nothing he can be criticized for,'' said his \\nwife, He Xintong. ``They're going to have to expend a lot of effort \\nto make him a criminal.'' \\n\\nProtesting the lack of a defense lawyer, the father of a prominent \\ndissident is to seek a delay in his son's subversion trial, scheduled \\nto start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan. The defendant is \\nQin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who has spent 10 years in prison \\nand labor camps and has recently promoted an alternative, non-Communist \\npolitical party. In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, \\nQin Qinguo, 76, said that before the trial begins, he plans to hand \\nthe court a written plea for postponement. If the plea is ignored, \\nhe said he will walk out. ``I wouldn't be able to stand it,'' the \\nfather, a retired steelworker, said, citing his frail health and high \\nblood pressure. Under China's code of criminal procedure, a defendant \\nhas the right to a defense lawyer. But in this case, the elder Qin \\nsaid, some lawyers he approached declined to take the case, while \\nothers were warned by security officials not to get involved. The \\nfather said he did not agree with his son's political tactics but \\nnow he felt he had no choice but to protest his treatment. Qin Yongmin \\nwas arrested on Nov. 30, only hours after his mother died of a stroke. \\n``He wasn't even allowed to attend the funeral,'' Qin Qinguo said. \\n``And now he's not allowed to find a lawyer.'' On Thursday morning, \\na few hundred miles to the east in the city of Hangzhou, Wang Youcai, \\n33, is to go on trial on similar charges of inciting subversion. He, \\ntoo, has no defense lawyer. Wang was a leader of student demonstrations \\nin Tiananmen Square in 1989 and served two years in prison after they \\nwere put down by military force. As the founder of the suppressed \\nnew political party, the China Democracy Party, he publicly announced \\nits charter in June during President Clinton's visit to China. Scores \\nof people around the country began to champion the new party, hopeful \\nthat closer ties between China and the United States, and China's \\nsigning of the international covenant on political and civil rights, \\nwould mean a looser political climate. But the party was soon declared \\nillegal and many adherents were detained, at least temporarily. Wang \\nnow faces charges that could land him in prison for five years or \\nmore. A third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party, Xu \\nWenli, has been detained for weeks in Beijing and is expected to face \\nsimilar subversion charges. In the last two days, at least 10 Democracy \\nParty members or supporters in the Hangzhou area have been detained \\nby the police and others have had their phone lines cut, reported \\nthe Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in \\nChina, based in Hong Kong. \\n\\nHours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty \\nand host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent \\nhuman rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest \\nrun-in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in \\na week to legally register a human rights monitoring group. Qin said \\na civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan \\naccused him of engaging in illegal activities. The police came soon \\nafter he returned home. ``As I'm sending this statement, the Wuhan \\nPublic Security Bureau is again taking me away,'' Qin said in a hastily \\nscrawled message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporters. \\nQin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about three \\nhours before being released and threatened with prosecution if he \\npersisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer. Qin \\nhoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International \\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities \\ndon't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting \\nhuman rights to the last.'' China plans to sign the International \\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. \\nBy the time the ink is dry, Blair should be landing in Beijing on \\nTuesday morning for the first visit by a British prime minister in \\nseven years. The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedoms of speech \\nand assembly. But even after China signs, the treaty would not come \\ninto force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservations \\neffectively nullifying some provisions. Blair has vowed to discuss \\ndifferences over human rights with Chinese leaders. His visit has \\ndrawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group \\nurging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners. \\nIn an open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leaders \\nsay they respect human rights principles, in law and practice the \\ngovernment allows rights abuses and persecution of dissidents. Thousands \\nof political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons, \\nlabor camps or detention centers, said the letter, a copy of which \\nwas released by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights \\nand Democratic Movement in China. The letter called for the release \\nof Shi Binhai, a journalist who compiled a popular book on political \\nchange; Fang Jue, a businessman who called openly for political reform; \\nand other imprisoned activists. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders \\nurged Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu \\nJingsheng. The three are among 13 journalists imprisoned ``simply \\nfor attempting to practice their profession,'' it said in a statement. \\n\\nThe separate trials of two prominent democracy advocates for inciting \\nsubversion of the state opened Thursday morning, with the families \\nof both defendants protesting their inability to hire defense lawyers. \\nThe trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32, founder \\nof the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was in session \\nfor just two hours and 10 minutes. It appears to be finished, although \\nthe court did not announce a decision or say when it would. ``I don't \\nknow what happens from here,'' said Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, who \\nwas one of three relatives allowed to attend the trial. ``I don't \\nhold much hope,'' she added in a telephone interview. Wang, who spent \\ntwo years in prison after the 1989 student demonstrations in Tiananmen \\nSquare, was accused of organizing a political party that sought to \\noverturn Communist Party rule and of colluding with foreign enemies \\nof the state. He could face five years or more in prison. Since all \\nthe lawyers his family approached were intimidated by security agents, \\nMs. Hu said, Wang tried to mount his own defense Thursday morning \\nafter prosecutors laid out their case. But the judge frequently interrupted \\nhim and cut him off after half an hour, saying he was not responding \\nto the specific facts of the case, she added. Wang argued that his \\nactivities were legal under China's constitution and under an international \\ncovenant on political rights that China has signed, Ms. Hu said. In \\nthe central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charges of Qin Yongmin, \\n45, a veteran dissident, also continued for something over two hours. \\nIt will apparently be continued, said Qin's father, Qin Qingguo, since \\nthe session ended after the prosecution presented its charges. In \\nthat case, too, prospective lawyers had been intimidated or detained, \\nfamily members said. The elderly father's request to the court Thursday \\nmorning for a postponement was ignored, so he and one of the defendant's \\nbrothers stayed outside the court building in protest, leaving another \\nbrother inside. ``We didn't feel there was any reason to observe the \\ntrial because if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney, then \\nas far as we were concerned the proceedings were meaningless,'' the \\nfather said by telephone. The U.S. Embassy asked to observe the trials. \\nWhen an embassy official arrived at the court in Hangzhou Thursday \\nmorning, he was told that there were no seats available and instead \\nwaited outside, greeting Ms. Hu when she emerged, shaken, from the \\nbrief trial. \\n\\nChina's government said Thursday that two prominent dissidents arrested \\nthis week are suspected of endangering national security _ the clearest \\nsign yet Chinese leaders plan to quash a would-be opposition party. \\nForeign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify what laws \\nwere broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered the state. \\nA third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been \\nin custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of ``inciting the \\noverthrow of the government,'' the Hong Kong-based Information Center \\nof Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. All three \\nmen could face up to life in prison if convicted of the harshest measures \\nunder China's vague state security law. The ruling Communist Party \\nhas resorted to the law to silence dissent since it went into effect \\nlast year. The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and \\nthe accusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese \\nleaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally \\nregister the China Democracy Party in June. Xu and Qin were ``suspected \\nof involvement in activities endangering state security'' and their \\n``behavior breached relevant provisions of the criminal laws of the \\nPeople's Republic of China,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly briefing. \\nPolice in Hangzhou city notified Wang's wife Wednesday that charges \\nhave already been submitted to prosecutors, bringing him a step closer \\nto trial, the Information Center said. Xu and Qin are influential \\nfigures in the dissident community, having started their campaign \\nfor change 20 years ago in the seminal Democracy Wall movement. Wang \\nwas a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations. \\nBoth have served time in prison. Xu spent 12 years in jail, much of \\nit in solitary confinement. Since dissidents began organizing and \\ntrying to legally register the China Democracy Party, police have \\nharassed and briefly detained more than two dozen members, but until \\nnow the government had not leveled such politically charged allegations. \\nThe Communist Party has never allowed another political party to form \\nsince it took power in 1949. In Washington on Wednesday, White House \\nspokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the arrests \\nand said the dissidents' peaceful political activities were fundamental \\nhuman rights that all governments should protect. U.S. officials conveyed \\ntheir concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged \\nthat Xu and Qin be released immediately. Zhu criticized the United \\nStates for condemning the arrests, saying that ``no country, including \\nthe United States, should interfere in China's internal affairs.'' \\nChina in October signed a key U.N. treaty on civil and political rights \\nthat guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association. \\nIt was the 17th international human rights treaty China has signed. \\nZhu told reporters there was ``absolutely no contradiction at all'' \\nbetween China's support for these treaties and its arrests of the \\ntwo dissidents. \\n\\nWith attorneys locked up, harassed or plain scared, two prominent \\ndissidents will defend themselves against charges of subversion Thursday \\nin China's highest-profile dissident trials in two years. Qin Yongmin's \\nand Wang Youcai's families were running out of options Wednesday to \\nhelp the pair, leading organizers of a budding opposition political \\nparty. Qin's family pleaded for a postponement at Wuhan's Intermediate \\nPeople's Court, but court officials denied the request. Police have \\ndetained one lawyer and threatened another, and subtler pressures \\nhave been used on others, family members said. Given the interference, \\nWang Youcai's wife assumes he will be convicted. ``Whether he has \\na lawyer or not, whatever he says, the government has already decided,'' \\nHu Jiangxia said. Qin and Wang will be tried separately, in cities \\n500 kilometers (300 miles) apart and in proceedings attended only \\nby family and a few observers selected by the courts. Qin, 44, and \\nWang, 31, are accused of inciting the subversion of state power, apparently \\nfor helping to organize the China Democracy Party. They face from \\n10 years to life imprisonment if convicted under the harshest aspects \\nof the law. By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, \\nthe ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination \\nto crush challenges to its monopoly on power. Authorities have detained \\nor questioned more than 30 people associated with the party in a 17-day-old \\ncrackdown. Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student \\nleader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among \\nthe most active and influential members of China's dissident community. \\nA third prominent member of the dissident community, Xu Wenli, was \\nalso arrested in the crackdown, but not yet charged. To prevent displays \\nof solidarity outside Wang's trial, police have detained at least \\nten dissidents in the eastern city of Hangzhou, a Hong Kong-based \\nrights group reported. The Information Center of Human Rights and \\nDemocratic Movement in China said many more are missing and believed \\nto be in custody. To prosecute Wang, authorities violated the minimal \\nrights guaranteed suspects under Chinese law and ignored court orders, \\nhis wife said. ``Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer, but while \\nI was doing this, some people were doing things to stop me,'' Hu Jiangxia \\nsaid. During one meeting with a potential defense attorney, a police \\nofficial stormed in and said, ```Don't do anything for them. Don't \\ntake this case. Whoever takes the case, you can't win,''' Hu recounted. \\nFour law firms refused to take Qin's case, his brother Qin Xiaoguang \\nsaid. The Information Center said one lawyer who initially agreed \\nto represent Qin on Monday went missing for four hours and then called \\nQin's family to withdraw. Dispirited by the harsh treatment, Qin's \\nfamily argued over whether to attend the trial. Qin Xiaoguang said \\nhe and his father have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness, \\nbut another brother will go. Three dissidents from northeastern China \\nsent an open letter to China's legislature and the Supreme People's \\nCourt appealing for fair trials, the Information Center said. It added \\nthat authorities violated China's own laws by not ensuring Wang and \\nQin have adequate representation. The letter was the latest in a string \\nof petitions demonstrating the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the \\nidea of the China Democracy Party. Since Wang publicly announced in \\nJune that he and others in Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents \\nin at least 14 provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities \\nhave refused their applications to register the party as required \\nby law. Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has \\nput on trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. \\nHe was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year \\nsentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile. \\n\\nIn response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese officials broke \\ntheir silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this week of a prominent \\ndissident who was trying to form an opposition political party. ``Xu \\nWenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging to national \\nsecurity and has violated relevant criminal codes of the People's \\nRepublic of China,'' said a statement from the Foreign Ministry, which \\non Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest. The sudden arrest on \\nMonday night of Xu, as well as several other activists involved with \\nhim in trying to form the China Democratic Party, set off strong protests \\nfrom human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents and Washington. \\n``We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamental freedoms \\nguaranteed by international human rights instruments as a serious \\nstep in the wrong direction,'' State Department spokesman James P. \\nRubin said in Washington on Tuesday. U.S. officials in Beijing urged \\nthe government to release Xu and asked for clarification as to the \\nexact nature of his crime. China signed the International Covenant \\nof Civil and Political Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's \\narrest is seen by human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment \\nto its tenets. Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, \\nwith more than a dozen activists around the country announcing that \\nthey would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the \\nChina Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home \\nin Wuhan on Monday. Almost 200 dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese \\ngovernment protesting the detentions, said the Information Center \\nfor Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong. Three other \\nDemocratic Party organizers were also detained on Monday, although \\ntwo of them were released early Wednesday. But the two more prominent \\ndissidents, Xu and Qin, are likely to face a much longer haul since \\nboth have been charged with ``criminal acts.'' Xu's wife, He Xintong, \\nsaid Wednesday night that she had still not been informed of the specific \\ncharge against her husband, although she surmised from the aggressive \\nbehavior of the arresting officers that the sentence ``could be long.'' \\nQin's family was told that he was charged with ``plotting to subvert \\nthe government,'' a crime that for serious offenses commands sentences \\nof three years to life. In the Chinese criminal code, this charge \\ncomes under a grab-bag section called ``threatening state security,'' \\nwhich makes almost any political activity that questions or hampers \\nthe authority of the Communist Party illegal, from ``violent or nonviolent \\nactivities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities,'' to \\n``activities designed to change the basic nature of the state.'' Xu's \\nand Qin's trouble almost certainly stems from their efforts to gain \\nrecognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network of pro-democracy \\nactivists in more than a dozen cities around China that was formed \\nthis year. In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressive \\nand defiant in their attempts to register the party with the government, \\nsubmitting repeated applications even after local authorities had \\ndeclared the concept of an opposition party illegal. They say the \\nChinese Constitution does not specifically forbid the formation of \\nnew political parties, although there have been no new parties since \\nthe founding of the People's Republic in 1949. In fact, the by-laws \\nof the China Democratic Party are fairly tame; they carefully acknowledge \\nthe central role of the Communist Party, but also support free speech \\nand free elections for public officials. ``My husband thought the \\ntime was right to begin working to form a new party, since China recently \\nsigned the covenant on human rights,'' Ms. He said. In September, \\na few Democratic Party members got some slightly encouraging signals \\nfrom local governments, which initially accepted their applications \\nto form a social organization to develop a party. But in recent weeks, \\nas organizers like Xu became more insistent and defiant, harassment \\nby the police increased. ``All this past week we felt something was \\ngoing to happen,'' Ms. He said. ``It seemed that anyone who came to \\nvisit us was later detained for a while. And there have been a lot \\nmore cars from the Public Security Bureau parked outside than is usual.'' \\n\\nOne leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec. \\n17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of China ``to incite \\nthe subversion of state power,'' according to court documents given \\nto his wife on Monday. The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, \\na founder of the China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests \\nhow serious the Communist authorities are in their campaign to destroy \\nthe fledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak \\nout over the last year. The charges that Wang faces, in a trial that \\nwill almost certainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence \\nof five years or more. Wang, 32, has been imprisoned in his home city, \\nHangzhou in eastern China, for a month, but was not formally arrested \\nuntil Nov. 30. On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters \\nof the new party, were detained. One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central \\ncity of Wuhan, and the other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being \\nheld on suspicion of subversive activities. Detailed charges have \\nnot been filed. Wang was a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations \\nin Tiananmen Square in 1989. After the army had crushed the movement, \\nWang was arrested and served two years in prison. Qin and Xu became \\nknown as democracy advocates in the late 1970s. Qin was imprisoned \\nfor eight years. In 1993 he was put in a labor camp for two years. \\nXu spent 12 years in prison. When President Clinton visited in the \\nspring, Wang announced the formation of the Democracy Party. He and \\nother dissidents hoped that China's new friendship with the United \\nStates and its decision to sign a global covenant on political and \\ncivil rights would give them room to promote political alternatives. \\nAfter Clinton returned home Wang was detained, warned and released, \\nonly to be re-arrested as authorities began what now appears to be \\na major crackdown on dissent. Monday, Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, was \\nhanded the bill of prosecution, according to the Information Center \\nof Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong. Wang is charged \\nwith helping draft a party manifesto that states, in part, ``Only \\nby establishing an opposition party can we be rid of this despotism.'' \\nThat is cited as grounds for the subversion charge, the information \\ncenter said. In addition to detailing Wang's organizing activities, \\nthe prosecutors charge that he colluded with enemies of the state \\nabroad, making his crime far more serious under Chinese law. He used \\ne-mail to send 18 copies of the party's founding documents abroad, \\nmet with a member of a subversive foreign organization and received \\nmoney from foreign sources to buy a computer, the indictment reportedly \\nsays. \\n\\nPolice detained and questioned the organizer of a group set up by \\ndissidents to monitor official corruption and told him the group's \\nactivities must cease, a human rights group said Thursday. Police \\nin Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, took An Jun away Wednesday \\nafternoon and held him until past midnight for questioning about the \\ngroup's members, said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic \\nMovement in China. Police wanted a list of members with their work \\nand home addresses, a demand An Jun refused for fear of getting them \\ninto trouble, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said. Corruption \\nWatch, founded by nine dissidents in seven provinces, now has nearly \\n100 members, the center said. It applied last month to the government \\nto register officially, but received no response, the center added. \\nThe police officers who questioned An Jun said that without official \\npermission, the group must cease its activities, the center said. \\nRampant official corruption is a major public gripe in China. The \\nInformation Center said Corruption Watch had already received reports \\nof graft in its first month of operation. In a separate report, the \\ncenter said that an official in the Sichuan provincial government \\nrefused Thursday to accept an application by three dissidents to form \\na branch of a would-be opposition group, the China Democracy Party. \\nGroups of dissidents in cities across China have attempted to register \\nthe group, as required by law, but authorities have rejected those \\napplications. Signaling that the Communist Party's 49-year-old ban \\non opposition groups remains intact, police have detained and questioned \\nmany dissidents associated with the group. \\n\\nA Chinese dissident fleeing a new round of arrests of democracy activists \\nin Shanghai arrived here Wednesday and announced that he and other \\nopponents of the Chinese government plan a demonstration Thursday \\nat the United Nations to protest the crackdown. The dissident, Yao \\nZhenxian, who was released in April from a Chinese labor camp, is \\na leader of the China Democracy Party, which was formed in June during \\nPresident Clinton's visit to China. Speaking through an interpreter \\nat Kennedy International Airport, Yao, 44, said little about why he \\nhad left Shanghai, except that he and his younger brother, Yao Zhenxiang, \\n38, had been sent to a labor camp in 1996 on a ``trumped-up charge'' \\nof publishing pornography. The younger Yao, who is also a prominent \\nfigure in the China Democracy Party, is scheduled for release in April. \\nLast week the Chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers \\nof the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang Youcai, is to go on \\ntrial Dec. 17. ``The Chinese government feels it expanded too quickly,'' \\nYao said at the airport, referring to his party. Washington gave Yao \\na special visa, which expires in February. Dr. Wang Bingzhang, 50, \\nan adviser to the overseas committee of the party, said later that \\nYao had left China for personal and political reasons. ``They were \\nscared all the time,'' he said, referring to Yao's wife, Yu Yingzhang, \\nand daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompanied him. ``The family had \\na terrible life, especially the daughter. Secret agents followed them \\nall the time.'' The family trading business, which was 12 years old, \\nwas shuttered by the government in 1996, said Wang, a former surgeon \\nin Beijing, ``so they had no way of living.'' In addition, after Yao \\nmade organizational trips to several provinces, democracy activists \\nurged him to go abroad, Wang said. ``They wanted him to tell the truth \\nabout what is really happening in China and to call on the whole world \\nto pay attention,'' Wang said. Beatrice Laroche, liaison at the United \\nNations for Human Rights in China, a New York-based group, said the \\nChina Democracy Party was a growing presence in some of China's most \\npopulous provinces, including Sichuan. ``But their most vocal leaders \\nhave all recently been detained,'' she added. Ms. Laroche said the \\nYao brothers, especially the younger man, won prominence by helping \\nto finance predecessors of the China Democracy Party with money from \\nthe family business before it was closed by the government. \\n\", \"\\nTurkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured \\nKurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting \\nhim asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.'' Kurds in \\nItaly, Germany, Austria and Romania launched protests and hunger strikes \\nin fervent shows of solidarity with the rebel leader. Kurds came to \\nRome by bus and car from across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong \\nprotest outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed held \\nunder tight security. If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, ``he'll \\nbe tortured for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter \\namong the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``And \\nvery possibly he'll be killed.'' Ocalan was arrested Thursday at the \\nRome airport as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where \\nhe had sought asylum after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He leads \\nthe outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting \\nfor Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict \\nhas killed nearly 37,000 people. To Turkey, Ocalan is the nation's \\nmost-wanted criminal. ``If Western European nations open their arms \\n(to the rebels) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' \\nDeputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara. ``If Italy \\ncontinues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday, it will be opening \\nits doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling \\nof brawls that broke out during the first day of protests Saturday \\noutside the Rome military hospital. The protest in Rome was peaceful \\nSunday. Elsewhere in Europe, dozens of Kurds protested in Bucharest \\nuntil chased away by police; 1,000 Kurds rallied in Bonn, some waving \\npictures of the Kurd leader; and 100 Kurds in Vienna set up tents \\noutside Parliament and declared a hunger strike. In Turkey, four Kurdish \\nprison inmates were in critical condition after setting themselves \\non fire to protest Ocalan's arrest, the independent Human Rights Association \\nsaid. Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened \\nopposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there have been no \\nexecutions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to \\nextradite anyone if there were even a risk of capital punishment. \\nForeign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting \\nof European defense and foreign ministers, saying he would tell Italian \\nForeign Minister Lamberto Dini that ``we expect a serious and fair \\napproach.'' He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who \\nreportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request. ``To \\nannounce the results of an extradition trial that has not yet even \\nbegun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' Cem told reporters \\nbefore departing. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin indicated \\nto reporters in Rome that Italian companies could be shut out of Turkey's \\nbillions of dollars of defense contracts if it fails to turn over \\nthe Kurd. In Italy, Dini told reporters in the city of Trento that \\nthe government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a ``clear \\nand responsible manner.'' It was up for the courts to decide Turkey's \\nextradition request, as well as an expected one from Germany, he said. \\nIn Istanbul, Turkish inmates at a prison took an Italian prisoner \\nhostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition. Metris prison \\nofficials said the jail director was talking to the inmate captors. \\nOcalan founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the group \\ntoward armed struggle in 1984, finding wide support among poor Kurds \\nin the underdeveloped southeast. The Turkish army claims to have all \\nbut wiped out the PKK within Turkey but the rebels have havens in \\nIran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting continues. \\n\\nAbout 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman \\nDemirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit. President \\nThomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued to take place \\nduring Austria's European Union presidency. Austrian government officials \\nreportedly will try to open up a ``longer-term perspective'' for Turkey's \\nEU membership. A related topic certain to come up is Cyprus, among \\nsix countries with whom the European Union started formal membership \\ntalks on Nov. 10. In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany \\nand France said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile \\ntheir differences weighed heavily on their island's membership chances. \\nThey spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the Cyprus negotiating process, \\nadding ``a political solution is urgently required.'' Austrian police \\ntook special measures to ensure the safety of the Turkish visitor. \\n``The political situation requires comprehensive security measures,'' \\nthe Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a senior police \\nofficer, as saying. The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last \\nweek in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers \\nParty PKK, Zehetmayr said. He hinted that he expects large protests \\nof Turkish groups in Vienna. Demirel, who was accompanied by five \\nCabinet members and a large trade delegation, is the first head of \\nstate of the Turkish Republic to visit Austria, APA said. Following \\nhis talks with Klestil and a luncheon in the president's residence, \\nDemirel was scheduled to meet Parliament president Heinz Fischer and \\nother senior officials. He was also to deliver a speech to the Foreign \\nPolicy Society later Tuesday. \\n\\nA Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast \\nfaces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder \\nand leader. Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's \\ninternational airport Thursday. Turkey has asked for his extradition \\nand Ocalan has asked for political asylum. Some believe that without \\nOcalan, who ruled some 10,000 loyal rebels with an iron fist, his \\nKurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will be left in disarray. ``If the \\nhead is dethroned, the rebellion gets a mortal blow,'' said Cengiz \\nCandar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah. \\nBut Ocalan has been absent from the battlefield for at least a month, \\nand others contend that the PKK is capable of operating without him. \\n``Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the end \\nof the PKK. The PKK has already been acting like a headless monster \\nfor too long,'' said Ilnur Cevik of the English-language Turkish Daily \\nNews. Turkish newspapers have carried frequent reports of power struggles \\nwithin the PKK and said that Ocalan's grip on the PKK was beginning \\nto waver. Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers \\nParty, PKK, in 1978. The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, \\nmainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also \\ncarrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey. Close to \\n37,000 people died in the conflict. His presence in Europe could also \\nbe a blessing in disguise for the group, forcing the PKK to transform \\nitself from a rebel army into a political movement. Ocalan seemed \\nto be moving in this direction before his detention. While living \\nin Damacus, he increased his meetings with European deputies. This \\nmay be the PKK's best option. The Turkish military claims it has made \\nimportant battlefield gains and captured the PKK's second-in-command \\nthis year. The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria, \\nwhich appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened \\nto attack it. Two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey's border \\nwith Iraq have also grown lukewarm. The PKK has used their bases in \\nSyria and Iraq to wage cross-border operations. ``The PKK had two \\noptions. Either they choose to fight until they get control of the \\narea, regardless of what image they project abroad, or they try to \\ntake on a political image. I believe (Ocalan) wanted to leave the \\nMiddle East so he could become a political figure,'' said Hikmet Tavak, \\nmanaging director of the London-based Kurdish television, MED-TV. \\nIn Rome, spokesmen for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully selected \\nItaly because he felt there was sympathy there for his cause. They \\nalso said Italian authorities were warned that Ocalan would be arriving. \\nThere is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if \\nthe movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under more \\npressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights. \\nThere are an estimated 8 to 15 million Kurds in Turkey. They are not \\nrecognized as an official minority and barred from using Kurdish in \\neducation or broadcasting. Kurdish politicians have been jailed and \\ngroups banned on charges of supporting the PKK. \\n\\nFacing his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister Massimo \\nD'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader \\nwho was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday. Turkey wants Italy \\nto extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' \\nParty, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. He \\nis viewed in Turkey as a terrorist. Germany also has a warrant out \\nfor his arrest on homicide charges. But D'Alema, a former Communist \\nwho was appointed prime minister last month, is under pressure from \\nleftists in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum. In a news \\nconference Monday, D'Alema recognized the extent of the problem. ``The \\nlast thing we wanted was an awkward and complicated situation like \\nthis one,'' he said. He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition \\nof suspects to countries that have the death penalty. Turkey has capital \\npunishment, though it says it will soon abolish it. Ocalan is being \\ntried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty. \\nD'Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine \\nwhether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which would be \\npossible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issued Monday, \\nholds up. ``We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy,'' \\nD'Alema said. ``This is an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody \\nconflict.'' Earlier Monday, while members of D'Alema's government \\nmet with Turkish officials who were in Rome for a European ministerial \\nmeeting, thousands of Kurds flooded into Rome to hold a demonstration \\nand hunger strike in support of Ocalan. D'Alema's decision was further \\ncomplicated on Sunday when Turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul \\ntook an Italian prisoner hostage, saying they would release him only \\nafter Italy extradited Ocalan. Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow \\nto pressure. \\n\\nGreek media and officials leveled strong opposition Sunday to the \\npossible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla \\nleader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey. Ocalan, whose Kurdistan \\nWorkers Party has waged a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in \\nsoutheastern Turkey, is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest \\nwas announced Friday. ``We do not give advise to other countries,'' \\nsaid parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis. ``Europe has a tradition \\nof civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abides by \\nthat tradition.'' Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan's \\narrest, which was welcomed by the United States. But Greek government \\nofficials have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination. ``We \\nhave repeatedly brought attention to the problems created by the blatant \\nviolation of human rights in southeast Turkey,'' government spokesman \\nDimitris Reppas said late Saturday. In the past, Greece has accused \\nAnkara of waging a campaign of ``genocide'' against its Kurdish population. \\nAnkara counters that Greece is harboring PKK ``terrorists.'' Both \\nsides angrily deny the charges. Thousands of Kurdish refugees from \\nnorthern Iraq and Turkey have sought refuge in Greece. A group of \\nmore than 100 Kurds began a three-day fast in a downtown Athens square \\nSaturday in support of Ocalan. Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest, \\nTurkey requested his extradition to face a number of terrorism-related \\ncharges, which could carry the death penalty. ``Italy knows what the \\nfate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he falls into the hands of the \\nTurkish military regime,'' said an editorial Saturday in the Greek \\ndaily Eleftherotypia. ``Ocalan has requested political asylum in Italy \\nas head of the Kurdish liberation movement and should be allowed to \\nremain in a democratic country. He must not be extradited to Turkey.'' \\nGreece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party called \\non the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep Ocalan \\nthere. The move was also supported by a number of parliamentary deputies \\nfrom the governing Socialist party. Earlier this month, a bloc of \\n109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an invitation for \\nOcalan to visit Greece. \\n\\nAbout 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital \\nwhere Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued \\ntheir hunger strike Monday to protest his detention. Kurds from across \\nWestern Europe have been streaming into Rome to show their support \\nfor Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was arrested Thursday when \\nhe stepped off a plane from Moscow. He had been seeking political \\nasylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He has, 3rd graf \\n\\nTurkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a \\nsecond day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held \\nhostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, \\na prosecutor said. The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, was taken hostage \\nSunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, \\nto push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, \\nTurkey's most-wanted man. Ocalan is currently being held in Rome. \\nCalascibetta, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his detention \\nin August, was due to be handed over to Swiss police Monday. He is \\nwanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection with a killing. \\nTurkey's Anatolia news agency said Oz was determined not to free his \\nhostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's demand to send back Ocalan \\nwho is Turkey's most wanted man. ``He is not in any life threatening \\ndanger. We are not alarmed for his safety,'' said prosecutor Celil \\nDemircioglu. ``The negotiations are continuing, we believe he will \\nbe freed very soon.'' Demircioglu said Calascibetta's extradition \\nwould now be delayed by a few days. He denied Turkish press reports \\nthat the Italian was being held at gun point. Oz is currently on trial \\non drugs-related charges. The mob has often supported right-wing parties \\nand ultranationalist causes. At a time when the state is under pressure \\nto crack down on the mob, it seemed convenient for Oz to show he was \\nbacking the government's cause. \\n\\nINNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back at \\nleast 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration \\ncrackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, \\nAustrian officials said Monday. Most of those sent back since the \\ncrackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they \\nhad no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said. On Monday alone, \\nabout 70 people were refused entry at the Brenner Pass crossing point. \\nThey included Pakistanis, Indians, Yugoslavs and Chinese as well as \\nKurds, the Austrians said. The border crackdown appeared designed \\nto prevent large numbers of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking \\nto Rome for protests in connection with Ocalan's arrest. Turkey has \\nasked for Ocalan's extradition. Austrian authorities said many of \\nthose turned back had come from Germany. A Red Cross station was set \\nup at the border to assist those turned away to return to Germany \\nif their residence permits were in order. Those without proper papers \\nwere detained by Austrian immigration. \\n\\nTurkey stepped up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured \\nKurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting \\nhim asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.'' In Rome, \\n1,500 Kurds massed for a second day of demonstrations outside the \\nmilitary hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held. Kurds arrived \\nfrom Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and \\na Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike. \\nIf Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, ``he'll be tortured \\nfor certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the \\nsinging, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``And very \\npossibly he'll be killed.'' Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport \\non Thursday as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he \\nhad sought asylum after recently fleeing his hideout in Syria. He \\nleads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting \\nfor Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict \\nhas killed nearly 37,000 people. Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist \\nand its most-wanted criminal. ``If Western European nations open their \\narms (to the rebels) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' \\nDeputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara. ``If Italy \\ncontinues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday it will be opening \\nits doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling \\nof brawls that broke out among the Kurdish demonstrators in Rome on \\nSaturday. The protests were peaceful Sunday. Ocalan faces the death \\npenalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened opposition in Italy \\nto his extradition. Although there have been no executions in Turkey \\nsince 1984, Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if \\nthere were even a risk of capital punishment. Foreign Minister Ismail \\nCem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting of European defense \\nand foreign ministers. Before leaving, he criticized an Italian Justice \\nMinistry official, who reportedly said Turkey's extradition request \\nwould be refused. ``To announce the results of an extradition trial \\nthat has not yet even begun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' \\nCem told reporters. He said he would tell Italian Foreign Minister \\nLamberto Dini ``that we expect a serious and fair approach.'' Ocalan, \\na political science dropout from Ankara University, founded the Marxist-inspired \\nPKK in 1978. He turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding \\nwide support among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast. The \\nTurkish army claims to have all but wiped out the PKK within Turkey \\nbut the rebels have havens in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting \\ncontinues. \\n\\nThousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurants, shops \\nand companies to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian \\nauthorities, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Kurdish business leaders \\nsaid the one-day shutdown Monday cost their 1,000 businesses some \\ndlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported. There are some 4,000 \\nKurds living in Romania. Kurdish students cut classes and workers \\ndidn't go to work. Some 41 Kurds declared a hunger strike Monday to \\nprotest Ocalan's detention. The protesters have refused any medical \\nassistance from Romanian authorities, relying on the services of two \\nKurdish doctors, the paper reported. ``We are not terrorists, as we \\nare considered by the Turkish state and its friends,'' said Aihan \\nDogan, a Kurdish leader. The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader \\nOcalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe. Turkey \\nhas asked for Ocalan to be returned to Turkey. \\n\", \"\\nTop-level budget negotiators for congressional Republicans and the \\nWhite House concluded yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon \\nwith plans to resume talks on Monday morning and probably extend their \\nmidnight Monday deadline for another day or two. Both sides were amiable \\nas they emerged from a two-hour session, but they had little to report \\nand indicated that their relatively early departure, compared with \\nthe last three nights, should not be interpreted as a sign of crisis \\nor of imminent peace in the budget talks. Sunday's discussions focused \\non education and President Clinton's request for $1.1 billion to hire \\n100,000 teachers, but aides said the bargainers did not delve into \\nmuch detail and nothing was resolved. ``I think we made some real \\nprogress today, but we still have a significant difference in the \\narea of education,'' said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff \\nand top negotiator, after Sunday's meeting. ``We're going to try to \\nplow through that over the next two days.'' Asked how far apart the \\ntwo sides were on education, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican \\nmajority leader, replied: ``I don't know. We're not together.'' He \\nsaid the two sides had made ``some progress, but not enough.'' The \\ntalks came during another day of escalated political confrontation \\nas congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they \\nhave three weeks until Election Day, tried to take advantage of the \\nstatic budget situation. Congress has passed only six of the 13 required \\nspending bills and are negotiating now with the White House on a final \\nomnibus package that will contain the remaining seven bills and major \\nissues including how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how much \\nmoney to provide the International Monetary Fund and under what conditions \\nit should be provided, and how much emergency money to provide for \\nitems like increased security at U.S. embassies around the world and \\nfor American farmers. Also to be resolved are a host of issues that \\nhave little to do with financing and more to do with ideology, including \\nenvironmental matters, contraception and national student testing. \\nRepublicans said the president had been disengaged from the process, \\nand they were irked at what they said was his swooping in at the 11th \\nhour and pushing his education agenda in an apparently successful \\nportrayal of himself as the guardian of that popular topic. Democrats \\ncountered that the Republican-led Congress had done nothing all year, \\nand cast the Republicans as extremists for blocking the president's \\nplea for more money to hire teachers and modernize schools. In fact, \\nRepublican bargainers said Saturday night that they would provide \\nthe money if local governments, not Washington, could decide how the \\nmoney would be used. Armey was one of many who castigated the president \\nfor apparent disengagement, an indirect reminder that Clinton has \\nbeen steeped in a sex scandal and is facing an impeachment inquiry \\nin the House. The scant number of congressional Republicans who did \\nnot leave town for the weekend used the House floor to press this \\nsame message. ``What about the president?'' asked Rep. Tom DeLay of \\nTexas, the majority whip. ``Maybe in Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp \\nDavid? Where is the president? I bet the American people don't know \\nthat he spent 152 days out of the 283 days this year fund raising, \\ntraveling and on vacation.'' Republicans said that Clinton had participated \\nin 98 fund-raising events so far this year and that two events on \\nMonday in New York, supporting the Senate campaign of Rep. Charles \\nSchumer, would bring him to 100. Clinton said at the White House that \\nhe was ``prepared to do whatever it takes'' to reach a resolution \\nover the spending bills, and dispatched his aides to Capitol Hill. \\nHe also said he would postpone from Monday morning until Monday afternoon \\nhis departure for his fund-raising tour in New York, and he canceled \\na fund-raising appearance in Florida. But as the high-level budget \\nbargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, both sides agreed they would \\nneed to extend their deadline beyond midnight Monday, when temporary \\nfinancing for the government expires for the third time since the \\nOct. 1 start of the fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back \\nat the Republicans, saying they have held a slack schedule themselves. \\nRep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress had been in session only \\n108 days so far this year, an unusually abbreviated period and one \\nconsumed for more than a month by the drive to hold impeachment hearings \\non the president. Most Americans, Miller said, had worked more than \\n225 days. ``They say, `Where is the president?''' Miller said. ``The \\npresident has been waiting for the budget. This is the first Congress \\nsince 1974 that has no budget,'' he said, referring to the broad blueprint \\nthat is supposed to guide spending. ``This is a Congress that can't \\npass seven of its appropriations bills,'' he said, largely because \\nof divisive splits among conservative and moderate Republicans. \\n\\nFor the first time in decades, Congress and the White House negotiated \\ntax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus. \\nThe result was chaos. The lawmakers were never able to agree on a \\nbudget resolution _ the framework into which all the tax and spending \\nbills are supposed to fit. This had not happened since congressional \\nbudget procedures were established in 1974. Then, without the discipline \\nof such an overall plan, the Senate and the House could not pass eight \\nof the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running. So \\nthe lawmakers had to stay in session more than a week longer than \\nthey had hoped. Finally, they lumped all eight bills together this \\nweek and announced an agreement. But the only way they could get this \\nfar was to resort to gimmicks. One was to designate $20 billion as \\n``emergency'' expenditures so that programs did not have to be cut \\nelsewhere to offset the new spending. This will use up more than one-quarter \\nof the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year. Another \\ngimmick extended the tax break for Individual Retirement Accounts \\nto couples with incomes from $100,000 to $150,000. This will actually \\nraise a small amount of revenue in the next five years _ the period \\ncovered by budget accounting _ but it will make the picture considerably \\nworse in later years. As hard as it was to negotiate a budget in the \\nbad old days of budget deficits, say the politicians involved, it \\nwas exponentially more difficult this year. At least in years past, \\nthere was a common goal. As much as they disagreed on policy and principle, \\nthey were all aiming at a reduction in the deficit. This year, some \\nmembers of Congress wanted to use the surplus for a big tax cut. Others \\nwanted to pay off the national debt. Others wanted to spend part of \\nit on medical research, schools and weapons for the Pentagon. Others \\nwanted to spend large sums on highways. Still others wanted to continue \\ncutting government spending. And that was just among the Republicans. \\nThe Democrats had their own ideas about the budget, and President \\nClinton laid down his marker about saving the surplus until a way \\nwas found to shore up the Social Security system. ``In budget terms,'' \\nsaid Robert Reischauer, a former director of the congressional budget \\noffice, ``this is like the end of the Cold War.'' There are other \\ndifferences as well in the way things were negotiated with the budget \\nin a surplus. In 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politicians staked their \\ncareers on striking a budget deal to lower the deficit, the fundamental \\nquestion was how to divide up the bitter medicine of more taxes and \\nless spending. Republicans, for the most part, opposed tax increases \\nand favored cutting spending on social programs. Democrats wanted \\nto raise taxes, especially on the rich, and protect social spending. \\nIn the end, balances were carefully drawn. But plenty of politicians \\n_ President George Bush, to name one _ lost their jobs in the process. \\nThis year, with Democrats and Republicans alike claiming victory, \\nthe burning issue was how to parcel out the candy. Democrats got more \\nmoney for education and farm assistance. Republicans got more money \\nfor the military and an extension of popular tax breaks for businesses. \\nSome of the $20 billion that will eat into the surplus really will \\ngo for emergencies, like relief for victims of Hurricane Georges. \\nBut much of the money, like the $90 million that will pay for six \\nnew helicopters for the national police in Colombia to use in drug \\ninterdiction, was designated emergency spending simply because there \\nwas no other way to get it into the budget. For the politicians, the \\nnew way is more fun. It is hard to imagine that anyone will be voted \\nout of office because of this year's budget. But that did not make \\nit easier to reach an agreement. The other big difference is that \\nthe principal fights this year were not over money at all. They involved \\ndelicate policy issues like needle exchanges, contraception, global \\nwarming, immigration and the census. In Congress, there is no consensus \\non these matters. So the only way policy could be set was to wrap \\nthem into the giant spending bill. It may be more pleasant to debate \\npolicy than money. But it is probably harder to find a way to split \\nthe difference. As long as the surplus lasts, the lack of discipline \\nthat characterized the budget-writing this year is likely to continue. \\nThis is distressing to those devoted to controlling government spending. \\n``The temptation,'' said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House \\nWays and Means Committee, ``is to grab the loot and spend it.'' \\n\\nHouse and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to require most federal \\nhealth plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, giving \\nan unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights. \\nBut the future of the measure was in doubt because it was attached \\nto a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding \\nthe Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle the \\nspending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the \\nPostal Service and which still must be approved by the House and Senate. \\nThe contraceptive measure would require the federal health plans, \\nwhich affect 1.2 million female federal employees who are of child-bearing \\nage, to cover the five methods of contraception that have been approved \\nby the Food and Drug Administration for use in this country _ birth \\ncontrol pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera. \\nCurrently, only 19 percent of federal health plans cover those methods. \\nThe House and Senate approved the contraceptive measure earlier this \\nyear. But the opponents of abortion were furious about the approval \\nand persuaded Republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion \\non the matter. The cost of contraceptives has driven up the out-of-pocket \\ncost of health care for women. And many male members of Congress seemed \\npersuaded to support coverage of contraceptives for women, since almost \\nall of the 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, the male impotency \\ndrug. Thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bills \\nbefore Oct. 9, when temporary financing of the government expires, \\nthe negotiators agreed to include the contraceptive measure in their \\nconference report on the $13.4 billion bill for the Treasury Department \\nand Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who pushed the contraceptive \\nmeasure through the House, hailed Thursday's agreement as the first \\nmajor accomplishment by abortion rights advocates since the Republicans \\ntook control of Congress in 1994. She said the negotiators had agreed \\nto include the measure because in an election year they did not want \\nto be perceived as opposing contraception or be seen as rejecting \\na measure that had passed both the House and Senate. But many Democrats \\nsaid the were upset that the bill contains a provision that is seen \\nas interfering with the independence of the Federal Election Commission. \\nThat provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven \\nfederal election commissioners every four years to retain the general \\ncounsel and staff director. The provision is aimed at getting rid \\nof Lawrence Noble, the current general counsel, who has investigated \\nthe campaign finance practices of groups like the Christian Coalition. \\nThe contraceptive measure is one of four related matters that have \\nhelped stall four spending bills. The three other bills that are stalled \\nin part because of abortion-related matters include the agriculture \\nbill, in which there is a dispute over whether the federal Food and \\nDrug Administration should use taxpayer money to approve drugs like \\nRU-486, which induce abortions. The foreign operations bill is also \\nstalled over whether to finance international family planning programs \\nthat may also promote abortion, while the labor and health bill is \\ndelayed because of a provision that would block access of minors to \\ncontraception. Addressing the measure on insurance coverage for contraceptives, \\nHelen Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of Catholic \\nBishops, said that the bill was bad policy. She said contraception \\nhad failed to stem the number of abortions, teen-age pregnancies or \\nout-of-wedlock births. ``Public-relations-wise, it's a good tactic \\nfor them,'' she conceded, ``but in terms of social policy, this is \\na failure.'' \\n\\nSome conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal \\nspending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for \\nthe $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided \\naid to farmers. However, no one can vote on the package just yet, \\nbecause it is not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican \\nleaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement \\non the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document. \\nThat is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees \\nand their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that \\nneeded to be resolved and that the final document could run to more \\nthan 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved is a dispute over \\nwhether airlines can create a ``peanut-free'' zone to protect passengers \\nwho are allergic to peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other \\nmembers from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting \\nthe proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three \\nrows of someone with an allergy. Congress gave itself until midnight \\nTuesday to vote on the final bill, agreeing with President Clinton \\nto a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government \\nopen. The budget was due Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. \\nThe vote was initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere near \\nto being written. Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including \\nGingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief \\nof staff Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final deal. Excluded \\nwere the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees, \\nwho now must write the language that will put the deal into law. Almost \\neveryone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass eventually, with \\nthe biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the \\n$20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergencies \\nand for the package's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut. The \\nlag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservatives \\nnervous that more members will try to add provisions that will further \\nexpand a bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry \\nthat once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly \\nrevealed, voters could put pressure on members not to support it. \\nThe elections are Nov. 3. But several conservatives said that despite \\nthese problems, they expected to support the bill anyway. Rep. Mark \\nSouder, R-Ind., said: `Most of my friends, who are predominantly activist \\nconservatives, are split about 50-50. If tax cuts were your primary \\nthing, then you're unhappy, but many conservatives have a mixed agenda. \\nMy position is, hold the nose and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and \\nfar too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. \\nEvery member has a little different focus.'' Souder said he liked \\nthe extra money for defense spending, and he liked the price supports \\nfor farmers. Hog farmers in his district, whose biggest customers \\nwere Japan and China, had been hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets. \\nSeveral Republicans said that the bill seemed skewed in favor of the \\nDemocrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed to curry favor with \\nDemocrats to shore up support if the House votes to impeach him, and \\nRepublican leaders feared that if they had stood up to Clinton, they \\nmight have forced a government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. \\n``Clinton was buying votes,'' said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. ``He \\nwas sucking up to the liberal Democrats so they would support him \\nin impeachment.'' Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said the leaders \\nseemed motivated by a desire to avoid the political damage they incurred \\nfrom the partial government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. He also cited \\nthe president's need to placate the left by adding costly domestic \\nprograms. ``The combination of the lessons learned three years ago \\nand the scandal on the president's side yielded the inevitable result, \\na budget that leans way to the left,'' Tauzin said. Still, he said \\nhe would probably support the bill. ``It won't be enthusiastically,'' \\nhe said. ``It won't be holding my nose either. I would have preferred \\nto spend more of this money on a tax cut. I think we would have gotten \\na tax cut, but for the scandal. If the president had not been caught \\nup with the scandal, he probably would have followed the Dick Morris \\nstrategy and moved towards the center.'' Gingrich said he recognized \\nthat some conservatives were wary of the agreement. But he sought \\nto reassure them that the package served their interests. He cited \\na $9 billion increase in defense spending. And he noted that the Republicans \\nhad blocked several items, including needle-exchange programs in the \\nDistrict of Columbia, national education testing and U.S. contributions \\nto a United Nations program that pays for family planning in China, \\nwhich many in Congress object to because China has a policy of coercing \\nabortions and forcing sterilization. Gingrich said the agreement was \\nthe best that could be achieved ``when you have a conservative Republican \\nCongress and a liberal Democratic president.'' Some conservatives \\nwho had been especially critical were more understanding Thursday. \\nRep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of conservatives in the House, \\nhad denounced the bill earlier as a Great Society type of big-spending \\nprogram. Friday, after a meeting of Republicans, he said, ``Our leadership \\nfound themselves in a bad situation and did a good job.'' A few remained \\noutright hostile to the bill, as much for the hasty way in which it \\nwas cobbled together as for what it contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, \\nsaid: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens between \\nnow and Tuesday. I think it's the process that gives the president \\nthe ability to stonewall until the very end and then hold us for ransom. \\nThe Republican leadership in the House and Senate did a good job of \\nlimiting the highway robbery, but it's still gone too far beyond the \\nspending caps.'' Also angry at the rushed endgame was Rep. Gene Taylor, \\nD-Miss., who took to the House floor and said he could not support \\nthe final bill. ``I'm going to urge my colleagues to vote `no,' '' \\nTaylor said. ``We have stayed here this long. We can stay a little \\nbit longer. And I am going to encourage my colleagues to continue \\nto vote no until we are given adequate time to study the measure that \\nis brought before us.'' \\n\\nA sticking point for White House and congressional budget negotiators \\nhas been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the \\nWhite House is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with \\nHouse Democrats as it is with the House Republican leaders. On Monday, \\nWhite House negotiators, led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, tried \\nto determine whether Democrats would accept a deal to finance for \\nsix months the departments of State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees \\nthe Census Bureau. The deal would put off until next March the contentious \\nissue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to \\nsupplement traditional methods of counting people. Bowles told the \\ngroup of Democrats that the House Republicans were willing to give \\non a number of outstanding issues that were stalling final agreement \\non the budget, but that they were digging in their heels when it came \\nto financing the census for six months. The Democrats met in the office \\nof Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale for the half-year \\nfinancing is that by next March the Supreme Court is expected to rule \\non whether using sampling is legal or constitutional. The Supreme \\nCourt has already agreed to review two lower court rulings that said \\nsampling would violate federal law. Oral arguments on the cases are \\nset for November. But House Democrats balked at the idea of six months' \\nfinancing for the census, arguing that even if the Supreme Court allowed \\nsampling, the Republicans would be under no obligation to approve \\nmoney for a census that included sampling. ``The general feeling among \\nmany Democrats was that even if we won the case, there would be a \\nlot less leverage in March, especially if it was the only issue left \\nto be debated,'' said a House Democratic official who insisted on \\nanonymity. Democrats contend that now is the time to press the Republicans, \\nwhile they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign. \\nRep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who attended the meeting Monday, \\nsaid, ``It was, sort of, this is where we are. We've been able to \\naccomplish great things, what do you think? We made it very clear \\nthat unless the census was included, along with some other issues, \\nlike school construction, the deal wouldn't be acceptable.'' Statistical \\nsampling would allow the Census Bureau to estimate populations that \\nare difficult to count, and would have the largest effect on the counting \\nof African-Americans in cities and blacks and Hispanics in rural areas, \\ngroups that are traditionally undercounted by the standard means. \\nRepublicans fear, and Democrats hope, that the method would raise \\nthe count of people living in traditionally Democratic areas, giving \\nthe party an advantage when new boundaries for election districts \\nare drawn following the 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, the Democrats \\nreminded administration officials that Clinton had promised that he \\nwould veto any legislation that restricted the Census Bureau's ability \\nto conduct an accurate census. ``I can't think of any way that restricts \\nthe census more than not to fully fund it,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, \\nD-N.Y. The willingness of House Democrats, including Gephardt, to \\npress the president on the issue represents a realization of their \\nleverage with Clinton, who will need all of their support in the coming \\nimpeachment inquiry. ``Gephardt is a major player now, and the irony \\nis we helped make him that,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., \\nwho supports the use of sampling in the census. The Democrats' position \\nalso indicates how little trust many have in the White House on this \\nissue. The proposal to finance the departments of Commerce, Justice \\nand State for six months is similar to one reached last November between \\nBowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea then was that holding \\nall three departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum \\npressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling. \\nBut House Democrats were not consulted before that agreement was struck \\nand later grumbled about it. At a meeting of the Democratic caucus \\nTuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmakers on dealings with the White \\nHouse and declared that Clinton had promised that he would hold firm \\non the census and that she believed him, a participant said. The statement \\nwas greeted with laughter. ``There is a certain level of suspicion \\nbecause there have been times when we have been cut out,''said the \\nHouse Democratic official. ``But I have to say, there hasn't been \\nmuch evidence of that, this time.'' \\n\\nStruggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, \\ncongressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday \\nwith their differences over education, staging events to demonstrate \\nsupport for what has become the most public and politically high-stakes \\nelement of the budget battle. Negotiators met into the night to hash \\nout their disagreements over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives. \\nThese were among the biggest issues that still separated the two sides \\nas each tried to formulate a message to take home to voters for the \\nNov. 3 elections. On education, the issue that President Clinton has \\npropelled to the forefront of the talks and on which Republicans do \\nnot want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend more \\nthan $1 billion but disagree over how to spend it. The president insists \\nthe money be spent on hiring 100,000 teachers across the country so \\nthat the average class can be reduced to 18 students. Republicans, \\nrailing against ``Beltway bureaucrats,'' say that local school districts \\nshould decide how the money is spent, whether it be for teachers or \\ncomputers. The two sides remained apart on several ideological matters, \\nincluding whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives \\nand whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to \\nrefuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on \\nmoral grounds as well. And they also were split on how to conduct \\nthe census in the year 2000. This is one of the thorniest issues. \\nIt is not one that moves voters, but it is vital to both parties because \\nit helps determine their relative strength in Congress. House Speaker \\nNewt Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and \\ntop negotiator, met for much of the day in the speaker's office, shuttling \\nin and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenants but giving few clues \\nabout the nitty gritty details of their talks. They have given themselves \\nanother deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion-worth \\nof spending items, but they could easily extend that deadline another \\nday or two. They missed the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, providing \\ntemporary funding for the federal government through Oct. 9, then \\nOct. 12, then Wednesday. Some of the other central issues, such as \\nfinancing for the International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed \\ndown, but neither side was ready to declare a final deal until all \\nthe other elements of the budget package are in place. ``We're down \\nto splitting infinitives,'' Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican \\nmajority leader, said of approving funds for the international fund. \\nAs they worked through several issues, Republican leaders appeared \\nto be calculating the differences in their own party that might sour \\na final deal when it arrives on the House floor _ more of a concern \\nthan on the Senate floor because the Senate has fewer differences \\namong its Republicans and with the White House. \\n\\nStruggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, \\ncongressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday \\nwith their differences over education, the most politically high-stakes \\nelement of the budget battle.

As the two sides broke Tuesday night, White House chief \\nof staff Erskine Bowles, the president's top negotiator, emerged from \\nthe session saying: ``We don't have a deal. We made some good progress. \\nThe biggest issue, still, is the 100,000 teachers.'' He added: ``There \\nare still some open issues'' upon which no agreement has been reached, \\nbut he sounded optimistic about a session scheduled for Wednesday \\nmorning. ``I think we've got a chance of wrapping up tomorrow,'' he \\nsaid.

Some of the other central issues, like financing \\nfor the International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed down, but \\nneither side was ready to declare a final deal until all the other \\nelements of the budget package were in place. ``We're down to splitting \\ninfinitives,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey said of approving \\nmoney for the IMF. As they worked through several issues, Republican \\nleaders appeared to be calculating the differences in their own party \\nthat might sour a final deal when it arrives on the House floor _ \\nmore of a concern than the Senate floor because the Senate has fewer \\ndifferences among its Republicans and with the White House. Some conservative \\nRepublicans said they were concerned over the emerging shape of the \\nfinal package, particularly elements dealing with family planning \\nand emergency spending. They say the president's proposals for emergency \\nspending, on such items as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fixing \\nthe year 2000 computer bug and providing relief to American farmers, \\nwill break the limits in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The \\nadministration said such money would come from corresponding cuts \\nelsewhere in the budget, but conservatives say it comes from raiding \\nthe surplus. If Republican leaders cannot count on their conservatives, \\nthey will need support from Democrats to pass the final package. And \\nDemocrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some White House positions, \\non issues like the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans \\non aid for farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House \\nconservatives, said he believed Republican leaders were ceding too \\nquickly to the White House. He said that the president appeared to \\nbe getting his way on some issues but that what he really seemed to \\nbe winning was the war of public relations. ``The president is getting \\nwhat he wants; he's controlling the situation,'' McIntosh lamented. \\nWhen Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears on television, McIntosh \\nsaid, ``it's in reaction to the president.'' Nonetheless, McIntosh \\nsuggested that he could vote for a final accord. ``Most conservatives \\nare holding out for a better deal than we're hearing,'' he said, ``but \\nwe'll probably give them the vote because we don't see a much better \\nalternative happening if it goes down.'' Others were distressed, particularly \\nabout two contraceptive issues. One would require federal health plans \\nto cover contraceptives. The other would bar overseas family-planning \\norganizations from lobbying to change abortion laws in other countries. \\nRep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted to see the final language \\non the health plan measure. As it passed both the House and the Senate, \\nit allowed for health plans with religious affiliation to decline \\nto offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn wants plans to be able to \\nrefuse such coverage on moral grounds as well. The plan covers five \\nspecific types of contraception. Coburn said he wanted two of those \\n_ Depo-Provera and intrauterine devices _ to be eliminated from coverage \\nbecause he said they interfered with fertilization and were therefore \\nconsidered to cause abortions. Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., \\nwho introduced the contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly \\nobjected to Coburn's position. She said that health plans based their \\ndecisions on what to offer on profits, not morals. The question is \\nwhether the White House will insist on keeping the contraceptive coverage \\nin the final package and will oppose the moral exception. If the administration \\nallows the moral exception, it could alienate some House Democrats. \\nHouse Democrats are also worried about the direction the talks are \\ntaking on the census. This has always loomed as one of the biggest \\nissues separating Democrats and Republicans. The results of a census \\nhelp determine the future power of the two political parties. But \\nthe fact that the two sides are finally talking about it now indicates \\nthat they are covering the full range of budget matters that need \\nto be resolved. The White House has proposed buying time on the matter \\nby financing the Commerce, State and Justice departments only for \\nfive months. The Commerce Department contains the Census Bureau. White \\nHouse officials said this would put off the nettlesome issue while \\nallowing a resolution of the entire spending package, but House Democrats \\nworry it would be a prelude to giving in to Republicans down the road. \\nRepublican leaders like the idea of postponing a decision but say \\nthat financing should be restricted only for the Census Bureau. On \\nseveral touchy environmental issues that have prompted repeated veto \\nthreats from the White House, the two sides appeared to be opting \\nfor compromise over confrontation, with several disputes resolved. \\nBut a few particularly difficult issues remained under negotiation. \\nA compromise was struck between the White House and Alaskan lawmakers \\non logging in the Tongass National Forest.

But compromise still eluded \\nthem on the question of building a road through a wilderness refuge \\nto connect two communities in Alaska. \\n\\nVoting mainly on party lines on a question that has become a touchstone \\nin the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the \\nSenate on Thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife \\nhabitat in Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across \\nthe edge of a wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the Aleutian \\nPeninsula, where it would connect an isolated village called King \\nCove to a long-range air strip in the town of Cold Bay. Without the \\nroad, its backers say, about 700 residents of King Cove must continue \\nto use unreliable air and boat service in emergencies, often risking \\ndangerous winds and seas as they seek medical evacuation to Anchorage. \\nOpponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent \\nthat threatens the seasonal breeding grounds of protected migratory \\nbirds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be a better \\nalternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, was a victory for the state's \\ncongressional delegation. But with President Clinton likely to veto \\nthe measure, the final outcome may depend on whether its sponsors \\ncan insert the road proposal into a huge spending bill that is likely \\nto emerge just before Congress heads home for the Nov. 3 elections. \\nThree Republicans voted against the bill, and six Democrats voted \\nfor it. The Clinton administration has repeatedly warned that it will \\nveto a big spending bill if it contains an array of anti-environmental \\nprovisions that are under consideration. Indeed, the White House seems \\nto be itching for a partisan fight over environmental priorities. \\nBut while many Republicans in Congress still appear reluctant to engage \\nin that broad fight, they were willing Thursday to cast their lot \\nwith the Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, \\nboth Republicans. A companion bill in the House, sponsored by Rep. \\nDon Young of Alaska, also a Republican, has not come to the floor. \\nEven Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a leader of Republican environmentalists, \\nvoted for the road. Last February Chafee's staff had assembled a score \\nof environmental lobbyists in his office to plan strategy for opposing \\nthe road, environmental advocates said Thursday. They speculated that \\nthe senator had changed his position out of deference to the power \\nof Stevens, who as chairman of the Appropriations Committee exerts \\ntremendous influence at a time when a dozen spending bills are in \\ntheir final stages. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly for \\nthe road after Alaska's senators convinced him of its merits. Stevens \\nsaid in angry tones Thursday that two-thirds of Alaska's land was \\noff limits to development and that vital health services were being \\ndenied to his state's residents. ``We can't use it without permission \\nfrom some bureaucrat who is compelled by extreme environmentalists,'' \\nhe said. ``They are so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek \\nrefuge, the smallest wilderness in Alaska, is so sacrosanct that it \\ncan't move its border 60 feet.'' But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called \\nthe road project a dangerous precedent. ``Building a road through \\na wilderness in Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be \\nthe first time in the nation we have voted deliberately to authorize \\na road through a wilderness area,'' Bumpers said. ``And once you go \\ndown that road, nobody knows where it is going to end.'' \\n\\nSome conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal \\nspending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for \\nthe $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided \\naid to farmers. However, no one can vote on the package just yet, \\nbecause it is not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican \\nleaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement \\non the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document. \\nThat is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees \\nand their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that \\nneeded to be resolved and that the final document could run to more \\nthan 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved is a dispute over \\nwhether airlines can create a ``peanut-free'' zone to protect passengers \\nwho are allergic to peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other \\nmembers from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting \\nthe proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three \\nrows of someone with an allergy. Congress gave itself until midnight \\nTuesday to vote on the final bill, agreeing with President Clinton \\nto a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government \\nopen. The budget was due Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. \\nThe vote was initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere near \\nto being written. Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including \\nGingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief \\nof staff Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final deal. Excluded \\nwere the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees, \\nwho now must write the language that will put the deal into law. Almost \\neveryone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass eventually, with \\nthe biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the \\n$20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergencies \\nand for the package's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut. The \\nlag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservatives \\nnervous that more members will try to add provisions that will further \\nexpand a bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry \\nthat once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly \\nrevealed, voters could put pressure on members not to support it. \\nThe elections are Nov. 3. But several conservatives said that despite \\nthese problems, they expected to support the bill anyway. Rep. Mark \\nSouder, R-Ind., said: `Most of my friends, who are predominantly activist \\nconservatives, are split about 50-50. If tax cuts were your primary \\nthing, then you're unhappy, but many conservatives have a mixed agenda. \\nMy position is, hold the nose and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and \\nfar too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. \\nEvery member has a little different focus.'' Souder said he liked \\nthe extra money for defense spending, and he liked the price supports \\nfor farmers. Hog farmers in his district, whose biggest customers \\nwere Japan and China, had been hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets. \\n\", \"\\nThe European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign \\nhostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's \\nforeign minister. In a statement, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner \\nHans van den Broek ``condemned in the strongest terms the senseless \\nkilling of the four hostages.'' Van den Broek said the EU was determined \\nto see remaining hostages in Chechnya released unharmed. He planned \\nto discuss the killings with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, \\nwho is in Brussels for talks at NATO. The severed heads of the hostages \\n_ three Britons and a New Zealander _ were found Tuesday. The men, \\nwho were working to restore phone services in the breakaway Russian \\nrepublic, had been abducted by gunmen in October. \\n\\nA French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more \\nthan 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, \\nnews reports reported. Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional \\noffice of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, \\nwas seized by three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz \\non Jan. 29. According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed \\nearly Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry \\nand the regional security forces of the north Caucasus. He was flown \\nto Moscow and was waiting for a special plane to take him to Geneva, \\nSwitzerland, NTV television news said. It was unclear where Cochetel \\nwas held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. \\n``He was liberated on the border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president \\nof North Ossetia, told NTV. French President Jacques Chirac spoke \\nto President Boris Yeltsin by telephone and thanked him for Russia's \\npart in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin press service said. His release \\ncame four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were \\nfound in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went \\nwrong. Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's bodies. \\nChechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings and \\nwas apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday, Interfax \\nsaid. Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to \\nChechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports \\nsaid. Tagirov was investigating the deaths Britons Peter Kennedy, \\nDarren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand. \\nThey had been abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. Their \\nheads were found Tuesday on a highway about 40 kilometers (25 miles) \\nwest of Grozny. Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against \\nRussia ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the \\nbreakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are \\nmostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive. \\nA Russian soldier taken hostage during the war was released Friday \\nafter a year of efforts to free him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. \\nAlexei Novikov had been seized in February 1996. Only a handful of \\nsoldiers kidnapped during the war are still in captivity. \\n\\nA truck blew up when it drove over a land mine in breakaway Chechnya \\non Friday, killing two people and injuring two others, a news agency \\nsaid. In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday \\nin the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechnya's \\nsecurity officials. Chechnya's ambulance service said that three to \\nfive people are hospitalized every week with injuries from mine explosions, \\nInterfax reported. It did not say how many people are killed. Many \\nof the victims are children, who dig the ground to look for ammunition \\nleft over from Chechnya's two-year independence war against Moscow. \\nRussia withdrew its troops in 1996. Chechnya considers itself an independent \\nstate, although no country, including Russia, has recognized its independence. \\n\\nA French United Nations official who was kidnapped in southern Russia \\nmore than 10 months ago was set free Saturday and flown to U.N. headquarters \\nin Geneva. Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. \\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized \\nby three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan. \\n29. Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation \\non the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but \\na longer firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security \\nforces, the Interfax news agency said. Cochetel was unharmed, but \\nhe said three of the kidnappers had been killed. In footage of the \\noperation broadcast by Russia's NTV television station, Cochetel was \\nshown lying face-down, hand-cuffed, behind a white van. Russian security \\nofficers in masks and camouflage stood over him protectively, then \\ndragged him away as gunfire erupted and bullets bounced off the van. \\nTwo security officers were slightly injured during the operation, \\nInterior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said, according to \\nthe ITAR-Tass news agency. No ransom was paid for Cochetel's release, \\nMikhailov said. Cochetel was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, \\nwhere he was met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere and \\nU.N. officials. He left Saturday evening for Geneva, where his family \\nand colleagues were awaiting him at U.N. headquarters, said Vera Sobolyeva, \\nUNHCR spokeswoman in Moscow. Speaking briefly, 6th graf pvs \\n\\nChechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped \\nforeigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them. \\nThe deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by killers \\n_ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads into Chechnya, \\nand caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from Russian and foreign \\nofficials. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one \\nalleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough \\ninformation to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons \\nand a New Zealander. But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers \\npanicked and decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to \\nRussian media reports. ``A concrete criminal group was identified, \\nan organizer of the abductions was arrested and an approximate location \\nof the hostages was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement. The \\nsevered heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway \\nTuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen \\nlaw enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday. \\n``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime,'' \\nsaid Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya \\nsince being elected last year. The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, \\nDarren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw \\n_ were identified by their former bodyguard. They had been abducted \\nby unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. ``He was just making a career \\nfor himself,'' Hickey's sister Deborah, 21, said Wednesday, fighting \\nback tears. ``He was fantastic with electrics and all that sort of \\nstuff.'' The family had expected 26-year-old Hickey to be back at \\nhis parents' pub in Thames Ditton, England, by Christmas. ``Everything \\nwas going right, everyone was very optimistic'' that the hostages \\nwould be rescued, she told Britain's ITV. ``The people that have done \\nthis to him, they deserve exactly the same back.''

The men, pickup \\n9th pvs \\n\\nOne of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed \\nin a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostages were British \\nspies. The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov \\nat a news conference in Grozny. He refused to answer questions about \\nit, including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government \\nhad it. The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard. One, \\nPeter Kennedy, claimed they had been sent to Chechnya by the British \\nsecret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their mission was \\nto gather information to stop the spread of Islamic extremism in the \\nregion, he said in Russian. It was not known whether he was speaking \\nunder duress. The severed heads of the four hostages were found lined \\nup Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Chechen \\nsecurity forces were still searching today for the bodies. The government \\nhas said it was trying to rescue the men at the time of their deaths, \\nwhich have outraged Britain and Russia. But its possession of the \\ntape was likely to increase suspicions of a government link in the \\nfrequent kidnappings in Chechnya since it won de facto independence \\nfrom Russia in a 1994-96 war. Most hostages have been released unharmed, \\nthough dozens remain in captivity. Kennedy and his three colleagues \\n_ Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of \\nNew Zealand _ were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom. They were \\nreportedly setting up a mobile phone network in Chechnya when they \\nwere abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. In the tape, \\nKennedy claimed they were using the equipment to monitor phone calls. \\nAsked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia Andrew \\nWood said, ``We don't comment on these things in general but any reasonable \\nanalysis would show we have no wish to spy on Chechen territory.'' \\n\\nAssailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating \\nthe killings of four kidnapped foreigners, officials said Friday. \\nMansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's \\ncapital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports said. \\nOfficials at the prosecutor's office said unidentified attackers seized \\nTagirov, and authorities speculated it was the work of an armed band \\nseeking the release of one of its members from prison. Tagirov was \\ninvestigating the deaths of four foreigners whose severed heads were \\nfound Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the breakaway Russian republic. \\nThe victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain \\nand Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified \\ngunmen in Grozny. It was not clear if there was any link between Tagirov's \\nabduction and his investigation into the killings of the four men. \\nMeanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said authorities \\nhad arrested a man who confessed to kidnapping the four foreigners. \\nThe suspect was identified as Apti Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency \\nsaid. Chechen security forces were searching Friday for additional \\nsuspects as well as the bodies of the four foreigners. Atgeriyev said \\nhe did not place any value in a videotape that showed one of the four \\nvictims saying he was spying for Britain. ``There are certain methods \\nthat might force a person to confess to any crime,'' Atgeriyev said. \\nThe videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president, showed \\nhostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been sent to \\nChechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the breakaway republic. \\nChechen officials refused to answer any questions about the tape, \\nincluding where or when it was filmed and how the government got it. \\nIt was not known if Kennedy spoke under duress. Britain's Embassy \\nin Moscow was trying to obtain the tape, spokesman Michael Haddock \\nsaid Friday. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British \\ngovernment agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, \\nAtgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency. Since Chechnya's \\ntwo-year independence war with Russia ended in 1996, feuding gangs \\nhave waged bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped, \\nmostly for ransom. Meanwhile, a Russian soldier taken hostage during \\nthe war was released after a year of efforts to free him, ITAR-Tass \\nsaid Friday. Alexei Novikov was seized in February 1996. Only a handful \\nof soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in captivity. The report \\ngave no details of his release. \\n\\nChechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped \\nforeigners Tuesday along a highway near a remote village after a two-month \\nsearch in the breakaway region in southern Russia. An Associated Press \\nreporter saw the severed heads near the village of Assinovskaya, about \\n40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did \\nnot see any sign of the bodies. The heads were lined up on a piece \\nof cloth along a main highway across southern Russia, NTV television \\nreported. The heads were identified as those of the four abducted \\nforeigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to \\nthe four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in \\nGrozny. He said the bodies had not been found. But Chechen government \\nofficials at the scene said four bodies had been found without giving \\nfurther details. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny \\nthat the bodies of four men had been recovered. The hostages _ Britons \\nPeter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's \\nStanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were working for Granger Telecom, \\na British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across \\nChechnya. Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors \\nMonday and he told police where the hostages were being held. But \\nthat information reached the other captors, who decided to kill their \\ncaptives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying. The \\nchief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday that Chechen \\nauthorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night that went ``tragically \\nwrong.'' No other details were available. He said the company had \\n``opened a dialogue with the kidnappers and received confirmation \\nthat the hostages were alive as recently as last week.'' ``Their murder \\nis an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts go out to the families \\nto whom we offer our deepest condolences. We are a small tightly-knit \\ncompany and everyone here is in a state of shock,'' Verth said outside \\ncompany headquarters in Weybridge, south of London, where flags were \\nflying at half-mast. Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies \\nin Moscow said they were checking on reports the four men had been \\nkilled, but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London \\nsaid it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found. \\nChechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is heading \\nthe investigation into the killings, said authorities had several \\nsuspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress, according \\nto the ITAR-Tass news agency. Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the \\nmissing men, said he heard the news and was hoping it would not be \\nconfirmed. ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from \\nout there that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping \\nand praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his \\nhome in England. Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing \\nmen for the past two months. British officials said they had not received \\nany ransom demand for the missing men. Maskhadov said the deaths of \\nthe four men were a major blow to Chechnya and its efforts to gain \\ninternational recognition of its independence. He blamed the rash \\nof abductions in Chechnya to unidentified ``outside forces'' and their \\nChechen henchmen. ``I am ready to answer before my people and the \\nwhole world for what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax \\nnews agency. Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common \\nin Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war \\nfor independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed. \\nSince the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in the \\nNorth Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of foreigners, and \\n90 of them released, officials have said. \\n\\nA French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more \\nthan 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, \\nnews reports reported. Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional \\noffice of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, \\nwas seized by three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz \\non Jan. 29. According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed \\nearly Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry \\nand the regional security forces of the north Caucasus. He was flown \\nto Moscow and was waiting for a special plane to take him to Geneva, \\nSwitzerland, NTV television news said. It was unclear where Cochetel \\nwas held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. \\n``He was liberated on the border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president \\nof North Ossetia, told NTV. French President Jacques Chirac spoke \\nto President Boris Yeltsin by telephone and thanked him for Russia's \\npart in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin press service said. His release \\ncame four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were \\nfound in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went \\nwrong. Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's bodies. \\nChechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings and \\nwas apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday, Interfax \\nsaid. Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to \\nChechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports \\nsaid. Tagirov was investigating the deaths Britons Peter Kennedy, \\nDarren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand. \\nThey had been abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. Their \\nheads were found Tuesday on a highway about 40 kilometers (25 miles) \\nwest of Grozny.

The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, \\na Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb \\ncaptives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. \\nProsecutor Grant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal, \\nand asked judges to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the \\nappeal. The U.N. court convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, \\nof 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because \\nhe oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic \\nsmiled as he heard his sentence of seven years in prison read out. \\nHis conviction was the first by an international court on the basis \\nof so-called ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II tribunals \\nconvicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of their subordinates. \\n``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under \\nhis authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without taking \\nany disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte. \\nHazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found guilty \\nof two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing other \\ninmates. He was sentenced to 20 years. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, \\nwas convicted of three murders and the torture of at least three other \\ninmates. He was jailed for 15 years. All four defendants had faced \\nup to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, which \\nhas no death penalty. Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month \\ntrial that focused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, \\nthemselves blamed for the vast majority of the conflict's war crimes. \\nDuring the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witnesses \\n_ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs \\nin the area. Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death \\nby guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts, according \\nto testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced to commit \\nsexual acts with members of their own family. The 49-page indictment \\ndetailing atrocities at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoners \\nwere killed in 1992. One prisoner was beaten to death and had a Muslim \\nparty badge nailed to his head, a witness claimed. Yet a few witnesses \\nalso praised Delalic and Mucic for humanitarian gestures, such as \\ngetting food and clothing to some prisoners and releasing others. \\nThe tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted \\nonly one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, \\nwho was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing and torturing \\nMuslims in 1992. Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, \\nhanding the tribunal two more convictions while sparing it the need \\nfor trials. \\n\\nSome of the closest combat in the half year of the Kosovo conflict, \\nto the point of fighting room to room and floor to floor, occurred \\nnear this village six weeks ago, in the days before 21 women, children \\nand elderly members of the Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian \\nforces, their mutilated bodies left strewn on the forest floor. Piecing \\ntogether what happened, from surviving family members, ethnic Albanian \\nseparatist forces and official Serbian information, a story emerges \\nof fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by Serbian tanks, artillery \\nand infantry. The Serbian forces fighting here appear to have suffered \\nunusually heavy losses and, after the guerrillas finally fled, took \\nrevenge against the civilians, shooting women and children at close \\nrange as they tried to run away from their pursuers. According to \\nrelatives who found the bodies, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, was decapitated, \\nhis brain left on display on the ground. Hava Delijaj, 65, was shot \\nand one of her feet cut with a knife so that it hung by a thread of \\nskin. Young women and children who had run a few hundred yards up \\na rocky path were mowed down. Miraculously, a 6-week-old baby, Diturie, \\nwas found by her father alive in the clasp of her dead mother, Lumnije, \\n30, more than 24 hours after the killings. ``Blood was in her mouth \\nand her mother's hand on the baby,'' said Imer Delijaj, the father, \\nan avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian \\nguerrilla force, who returned in uniform to discover the bodies. ``I \\nmoved her hand and at that moment she opened her eyes. I realized \\nshe was alive. I tried to clean the blood from her mouth and she put \\nher tongue out.'' Several members of the Delijaj clan survived. Zejnije \\nDelijaj, 39, who had cooked for the guerrillas at the family compound \\nwhen they returned from fighting in the days before the massacre, \\nrecalled how she fled, crawling, falling, running and hiding in the \\nwoods as the Serbs shot at her. ``I could feel the dirt hitting me \\nfrom the impact of the bullets,'' she said in an interview, her nose \\nstill bloodied from what she said was a heavy fall during her flight. \\n``First it was machine guns, then grenades, then cannon,'' she said. \\n``Every time I moved and they heard leaves rustling, they shot.'' \\nThe massacre of the Delijajs, whose forebears settled in the Drenica \\nValley about 150 years ago, was not the first in the conflict that \\nravaged the Serbian province between March and October and has now \\nlulled into an uneasy truce. Indeed, the conflict between Serbian \\nforces bent on keeping Kosovo in Serbia and guerrillas fighting for \\nthe independence of its heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew \\ninternational attention with the massacre of the Jasari clan in early \\nMarch by Serbian units at Prekaz, in central Kosovo. But the killing \\nof the Delijajs, ranging from the paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94, \\nwho was burned in his bed, to the slaughter of Valmir, 18 months, \\nwho was found shot, is the most thoroughly documented so far. Human \\nRights Watch, a New York-based group, believes the knowledge gathered \\nso far increases the possibility of prosecutions by the U.N. war crimes \\ntribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. The Hague's prosecutors could \\nalso draw on the observations of diplomats, human rights monitors \\nand reporters who saw the bodies scattered in the ravine where the \\nvictims were killed before they were buried in shallow graves in the \\nclan's nearby compound. In other Kosovo massacres, bodies had been \\nmoved from the sites before they were seen by independent observers. \\nFurther, family members who survived the assault have described what \\nthey saw and the circumstances in the hills and valleys around Obrinje \\nas the Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, from \\ntheir headquarters at Likovac, north of here. By then, the Albanian \\nguerrillas had fled the area around the Delijaj compound, dispersing \\nafter what a senior commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim \\nMaloku, termed particularly fierce combat with the Serbs. In the days \\nbefore Sept. 26, he said, the guerrillas _ caught in a Serbian pincer \\nmovement _ had decided to fight rather than surrender. The fighting \\n_ sometimes house to house, even room to room _ took an unusually \\nheavy toll among the Serbs, said Maloku, a former officer in the Yugoslav \\narmy. He said he believed that it was those deaths the Serbs avenged \\nwith the massacre of the Delijajs. In other major attacks during the \\nconflict, the guerrillas generally found an escape hatch. In Obrinje, \\nled by another former officer of the Yugoslav army whom Maloku declined \\nto name, the guerrillas fought, using land mines and rocket-propelled \\ngrenades. Maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquarters \\nthat at least 47 Serbian soldiers and police officers were killed \\nin the fighting between here and Bajince, three miles east. ``We took \\nweapons from 47 Serbs,'' he said. The state-controlled Serbian media \\ncenter in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officers \\nwere killed in the fighting, including five reservists who died when \\ntheir vehicle hit an antitank mine on Sept. 25. The announcement of \\n10 Serbs killed in one action is unusually high. The practice of taking \\nviolent revenge is a time-honored tradition in the Balkans. From 1991 \\nto 1995, in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, to \\na far lesser extent, the main victims, the Muslims, avenged World \\nWar II massacres and new blood feuds, driven into killing by leaders \\nwho exploited old conflicts to carve new fiefs for themselves as the \\nold, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed. In this case, it appears, Serbian \\nvengeance was visited upon the Delijajs. Survivors of the clan said \\nthey had feared an assault on their collection of mud and brick homes \\nlining a rocky dirt track directly opposite the village of Likovac, \\nthe Serbs' base just a mile away. The Serbs had pushed the rebels \\nout of Likovac in August and the guerrillas had established new headquarters \\naround Bajince, six miles east of Obrinje. As the Serbs swept down \\nfrom the nearby Cicavica Mountains, and up from the road that runs \\nfrom Pristina to Klina, it was clear that Obrinje would be a target. \\nMost women and children in the area had moved into Apple Valley, where \\nmore than 10,000 refugees had gathered outdoors, seeking safety in \\nnumbers. But Imer Delijaj, 38, said he decided that the ravine below \\nhis family compound would be a better hiding place. He said he believed \\nthe women, children and elderly would be spared if the Serbs found \\nthem. As the Serbs approached on foot the Saturday morning of the \\nmassacre, the last person to flee the compound itself was Bashkim \\nDelijaj, 21, the youngest son of 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj \\nsaid he had stayed behind to look after his bedridden father. ``The \\nshelling started again at 7 a.m. on Saturday and I saw a tank convoy \\napproaching, with infantry behind the tanks,'' Bashkim Delijaj recalled \\nin an interview. ``I was smoking a cigarette when a grenade fell on \\nthe roof and from a hole in the gate I saw soldiers coming from about \\n30 meters away. They were in brown army uniforms, had huge knives \\nor small axes. Many had beards.'' Bashkim Delijaj said he was unable \\nto carry his father to safety, and did not have the courage to tell \\nhim what was happening. ``I told him I was getting the animals out \\nof the barn,'' he said. He said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventually \\nreceived shelter from a farmer, all the time hearing shooting and \\nshelling. When the firing had died down Monday morning, he returned \\nto the compound and ran into Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform. \\nThey went to one of the houses and found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, \\n33, shot dead, his body sprawled on the ground in the rain, and the \\nburned torso of Fazli. ``I looked in the window of our house and saw \\nonly the bones of my father, which looked like what we learned in \\nbiology class,'' he said. Together, the two men went to find out what \\nhad happened in the ravine. There they found the bodies. First, Ali, \\n65, who, Imer Delijaj said, had been cut through the neck with his \\nown tobacco cutting knife. Then Pajazit, who had been decapitated \\nin a makeshift tent, his brain placed between two foam mattresses. \\nThen Hava, 65, who was sprawled near the tent. They moved on to find \\nJeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not \\nfar away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who was seven months pregnant, \\nhad been mutilated, he said. A little further up the ravine, Imer \\nsaid he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30. He opened his wife's coat and found \\nhis 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 months old and recovering at a relative's \\nhome in Likovac. He said he tried to clean the baby and then put her \\nunder his jacket and walked a few feet further to find the bodies \\nof his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young children, \\nDonieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7. The corpses of other family members were \\nfound in the woods and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, were \\nfound the next morning, Imer said. On Oct. 3, the bodies of two missing \\nteen-age girls, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, were found in the bushes \\nat the side of a road near an abandoned Serbian police compound. Later \\nin the month, the body of Hajriz was found pushed down a well, close \\nto the ravine. One uncle, Sharif, who was in the ravine, is still \\nmissing, presumed dead. Human Rights Watch, which has been documenting \\nthe Delijaj massacre, has described it as the most vicious of a pattern \\nof attacks on civilians by the Serbs in the Kosovo conflict. (To a \\nlesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians, \\nforcing them from their homes, and allegedly carried out at least \\ntwo massacres.) The evidence strongly indicates that the Gornje Obrinje \\nkillings were followed by conscious mutilations carried out after \\nthe victims were killed, a coming report by Human Rights Watch says. \\nDelijaj family members have told Human Rights Watch monitors and others \\nthat they saw an ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying the Serbian \\npolice officers during the fighting. They believe that the police \\nofficer, who is posted at the nearby Glogovac police station, was \\nused by the Serbian special police officers as a guide to the Obrinje \\narea. This police officer, who is apparently one of a small group \\nof ethnic Albanians officers who have remained loyal to the Serbs, \\ncould be an important witness for criminal investigators from the \\nwar-crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to human rights experts. \\n``The ethnic Albanian policeman could be an important witness to identifying \\nthe police and army units responsible for the atrocities,'' said Peter \\nBoueckhart, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. ``It is vital that \\nthose who carried out these atrocities are prosecuted by the Hague \\ntribunal.'' At the burned Delijaj compound in the last week, Imer \\nDelijaj has been acting as the host of a wake which, following Albanian \\ntradition, will last several weeks and began after family members \\nreturned from their hiding places in the woods. Color photographs \\nof the youngest members of the family, and of Imer's mother and grandmother, \\nhave been mounted behind glass on a table outside the gate. A 30-year-old \\nfaded black and white picture of Fazli in a double-breasted suit stands \\napart, a sign of ultimate respect. An outsized Albanian flag with \\na black double-headed eagle on a red field is draped behind the table. \\nImer Delijaj's face seemed tense and his words were spare as he described \\nhis family's death. He did not express direct remorse for allowing \\nhis family to use a hiding place so close to the family compound, \\nwhich for all practical purposes was an informal base for fighters. \\nHis lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, who said he was eager to be helpful to \\ninvestigators of the Hague tribunal, said in Pristina that he believed \\nImer Delijaj felt guilty for a faulty decision. Whether the tribunal \\nwill closely examine the case remains unclear. Slobodan Milosevic, \\nthe Yugoslav president, has issued only a handful of visas to investigators \\nfrom the tribunal. Two investigators who were in Kosovo at the time \\nof the massacre left six days later without visiting the site or contacting \\nKrasniqi about the killings. Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As he \\nsat on the floor of his living room with a group of male visitors, \\nhe replied: ``It's easy to answer. If I can see eye to eye with men \\nI will fight them. But only with men in uniform and in a fair fight. \\nIf I see children with them, I will treat them like children all over \\nthe world. Children are children.'' \\n\\nYugoslavia must cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating \\nalleged atrocities during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, international \\nlegal experts meeting in Belgrade said Sunday. The meeting was the \\nfirst international debate in Yugoslavia over the U.N. tribunal's \\nwork and the government's cooperation with it. The tribunal, established \\nby the U.N. Security Council in 1993, sits in The Hague, Netherlands. \\nDespite objections to the tribunal, Yugoslav authorities allowed the \\ntwo-day discussions _ organized by the Belgrade-based, non-governmental \\nHumanitarian Law Center _ to take place without any problems. State-run \\nmedia largely ignored the event. Though there were some disagreements, \\nparticipants in the discussions generally agreed that crimes against \\nhumanity cannot go unpunished. ``The indicted who are not in The Hague \\nare at-large because of the refusal by Croatian and Yugoslav authorities \\nto arrest and extradite them,'' said Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative \\nof the American Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting \\nof Serbia and Montenegro, cooperates with the tribunal in cases where \\nSerbs were the victims in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republics \\nthat fought wars for their secession. But Yugoslavia has questioned \\nthe tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers \\nwanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia. Last week, it also refused \\nto allow U.N. investigators to probe alleged atrocities in Serbia's \\nsouthern Kosovo province where ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting \\ngovernment forces. ``The tribunal was founded to satanize Serbs,'' \\nsaid Miodrag Mitic, a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign \\nministry. He said the U.N. court was influenced by powerful countries \\nthat dominate the international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, \\nthe U.S. State Department's ambassador at-large for war crimes, demanded \\nYugoslavia's full cooperation. \\n\\nAmerican and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian \\nSerb general who was charged with genocide by the international war \\ncrimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment. Maj. Gen. Radislav \\nKrstic, arrested without incident in the American sector in northeast \\nBosnia, is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far, and the \\nfirst serving military officer. He is accused of directing the attack \\non Srebrenica in 1995, one of the most chilling and influential events \\nof the Bosnian war, when some 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men were marched \\noff, presumably to their deaths, as U.N. peacekeepers stood by. The \\nindictment of Krstic accuses him of having committed genocide during \\nand after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and Nov. 1, 1995. \\nHe is indicted both in connection with ``direct personal involvement \\nin the commission of these crimes'' as well as his command responsibility. \\nHe is also accused of murder and other crimes against humanity. Krstic \\nwas a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion, \\nbut was promoted to general within days of the fall of Srebrenica. \\nHe is considered a close associate of the Bosnian Serb commander, \\nGen. Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, \\nboth of whom are wanted by the tribunal. And he is considered capable, \\nif he is willing to testify, of implicating Yugoslav President Slobodan \\nMilosevic, who has not been indicted. Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor \\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, \\ncalled Krstic ``a very significant military leader'' and said she \\nwas delighted with the arrest. The general was only indicted on Oct. \\n30, tribunal officials said, but the indictment was kept secret so \\nthere would be a better chance of a successful arrest. NATO Secretary-General \\nJavier Solana warned that other war crimes suspects still at large \\n``should realize that they, too, will be brought to justice.'' James \\nRubin, the State Department spokesman, said that the arrest ``serves \\nas a standing warning to those indicted for war crimes, who remain \\nat large, that they will be held individually accountable for their \\nactions.'' The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest, with the \\nhardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, saying that his \\ngovernment would now reduce contacts with NATO-led peacekeeping forces \\n``to the necessary minimum.'' Poplasen, who defeated a more moderate \\ncandidate backed by Washington in September elections, said the arrest \\nof Krstic had ``embittered and upset'' the Bosnian Serbs and would \\nharm the implementation of the Dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995 \\nBosnian war. He said he would protest the arrest, and his remarks \\nwere later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote. A senior official \\nof a NATO country called the arrest ``very good news'' and said it \\nwas ``a warning to Milosevic himself'' and others who have not been \\npublicly indicted that ``the murders committed have not been forgotten.'' \\nA Pentagon official said the arrest, the most important made in the \\nAmerican sector, ``was a sign that this is a continuing process.'' \\nNATO-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine people wanted \\nfor war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, four of whom were the subject \\nof sealed indictments. There have been numerous calls for the arrest \\nof Mladic and Karadzic, the two most infamous men indicted, but they \\nnormally are accompanied by armed guards. NATO forces have never tried \\nto arrest them, apparently fearing casualties and an angry public \\nreaction from Bosnian Serbs. Officials say that both Mladic and Karadzic \\nare believed to have left the Bosnian Serb Republic to live in Serbia, \\nwhich is part of Yugoslavia and controlled by Milosvevic. Krstic, \\nwho was transferred to The Hague for trial, is the 35th suspect who \\nhas been taken there and the 26th person currently being held there. \\nHe is the commander of the Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and was arrested \\nwhile traveling on the road to Bijelina. At the outset of the war \\nin 1992, he was an officer of the Yugoslav Army, and like all senior \\nBosnian Serb officers, was transferred to the new Bosnian Serb force. \\nIn 1994, he lost a leg in a mine explosion. One Bosnian Serb official \\nsaid in a telephone interview that, at the time, Krstic had responsibility \\nfor ``anti-terrorist units'' who were given some of the most difficult \\ntasks. ``Srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people don't \\ntalk about it,'' the official said. ``But everyone believes it was \\nthe anti-terrorist units that were sent to do the killing.'' In Banja \\nLuka on Wednesday, some members of the Bosnian Serb parliament protested \\nthe arrest, saying that Krstic was simply doing his job as a soldier. \\nIvo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council, \\nnow with the Brookings Institution, said the arrest showed a new and \\npromising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troops, given \\nthe rapid arrest after the Oct. 30 indictment. He also said that the \\narrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send \\nan important message. Srebrenica was a key town in the Bosnian conflict. \\nIt was where the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993, \\nwhen the commander of U.N. troops personally led a convoy of trucks \\nto the surrounded town and promised the Bosnian Muslims there that \\nSrebrenica would be a ``safe area'' and the United Nations would protect \\nthem. But in July 1995, the United Nations did not protect Srebrenica \\nwith air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watched as the Serbs marched \\nin, separated Muslim men and women and marched the men off. ``Srebrenica \\nsignaled the massive failure of the West,'' said Daalder. ``It galvanized \\nthe United States and NATO to act.'' At a London conference later \\nin July, NATO agreed to defend Gorazde and remaining safe areas with \\nmassive air strikes if necessary. After a mortar attack on the Sarajevo \\nmarketplace in late August, NATO air strikes began, signaling the \\nlast chapter of the war and leading to the American-brokered Dayton \\nAccords. In Sarajevo Wednesday, an aide to the Bosnian Muslim member \\nof the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, praised the arrest. \\n``We welcome this action, hoping very soon that the time will come \\nfor Karadzic and Mladic to be brought to justice,'' said the aide, \\nMirza Jajric. The arrest took place as foreign ministers of the member \\ncountries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \\nmet in Oslo, Norway, to discuss the international effort to keep the \\npeace in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province. Under a deal pressed \\non Milosevic in October, the organization will provide up to 2,000 \\ncivilians to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo and to promote a political \\nsettlement there to give Kosovo enhanced autonomy. Macedonia's government \\nWednesday formally approved the basing of 1,700 NATO troops near its \\nborder with Kosovo. Those troops will be prepared to rush to the aid \\nof the civilian monitors if necessary. \\n\\nThe Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander \\nof war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted \\nthree underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities. \\nThe Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, \\nof responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb captives at \\na Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. Prosecutor \\nGrant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal, and asked \\njudges to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the appeal. The \\nU.N. court convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 \\nwar crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because he \\noversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic smiled \\nas he heard his sentence of seven years in prison read out. His conviction \\nwas the first by an international court on the basis of so-called \\n``command responsibility'' since post-World War II tribunals convicted \\nNazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of their subordinates. \\n``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under \\nhis authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without taking \\nany disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte. \\nHazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found guilty \\nof two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing other \\ninmates. He was sentenced to 20 years. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, \\nwas convicted of three murders and the torture of at least three other \\ninmates. He was jailed for 15 years. All four defendants had faced \\nup to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, which \\nhas no death penalty. Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month \\ntrial that focused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, \\nthemselves blamed for the vast majority of the conflict's war crimes. \\nDuring the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witnesses \\n_ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs \\nin the area. Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death \\nby guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts, according \\nto testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced to commit \\nsexual acts with members of their own family. The 49-page indictment \\ndetailing atrocities at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoners \\nwere killed in 1992. One prisoner was beaten to death and had a Muslim \\nparty badge nailed to his head, a witness claimed. Yet a few witnesses \\nalso praised Delalic and Mucic for humanitarian gestures, such as \\ngetting food and clothing to some prisoners and releasing others. \\nThe tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted \\nonly one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, \\nwho was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing and torturing \\nMuslims in 1992. Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, \\nhanding the tribunal two more convictions while sparing it the need \\nfor trials. \\n\\nIn its first case to deal with atrocities against Serbs during Bosnia's \\ncivil war, a U.N. war crimes tribunal on Monday convicted three prison \\nofficials and guards, but acquitted a top military commander who oversaw \\nthe facility. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Cmndr. Zejnil \\nDelalic, of the Bosnian Muslim Army, of responsibility for war crimes \\ncommitted at a government-run prison camp under his overall command. \\nProsecutor Grant Niemann of Australia said he would appeal Delalic's \\nacquittal. Judges freed Delalic pending the outcome of the appeal. \\n``Let me thank you for a just and fair judgment,'' Delalic told the \\ncourt. ``The judgment has even increased my trust in this institution.'' \\nThe tribunal convicted camp warden Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war \\ncrimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because he oversaw \\nguards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic, wearing dark \\nsunglasses and a cross, smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years \\nin prison. Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt of Australia \\nsaid he was considering appealing Mucic's ``inadequate'' sentence. \\nMucic's conviction was the first by an international court on the \\nbasis of ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II tribunals \\nconvicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of their subordinates. \\n``Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under \\nhis authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without taking \\nany disciplinary action,'' said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte \\nof Nigeria. Monday's verdicts ended a marathon 20-month trial that \\nfocused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves \\nblamed for the vast majority of war crimes committed during the 3 \\n1/2-year Bosnian conflict. During the trial _ the tribunal's longest \\nto date involving 122 witnesses _ survivors described the campaign \\nof terror unleashed against Serbs in the area. Inmates at the Celebici \\nprison camp were beaten to death by guards wielding baseball bats, \\nwooden planks and rifle butts, according to testimony. Others were \\nset on fire, raped and forced to commit sexual acts with members of \\ntheir own family. The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici \\nasserts that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992. One prisoner \\nwas beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, \\na witness claimed. Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic, \\nfor humanitarian gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some \\nprisoners and releasing others. Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as \\ndeputy warden of the camp, was found guilty of two murders and of \\nraping two women as well as torturing other inmates. He was sentenced \\nto 20 years by Karibi-Whyte, who denounced rape as ``a despicable \\nact which strikes at the very core of human dignity and physical integrity.'' \\nDelic's defense attorney said he would likely appeal. Esad Landzo, \\na Muslim guard, was convicted of killing three prisoners and torturing \\nat least three others and was sentenced to 15 years. His attorneys \\nalso are likely to appeal the conviction. All four defendants had \\nfaced up to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, \\nwhich has no death penalty. A charge against Delic and Mucic of plundering \\nproperty was dismissed by the three-judge panel. Mucic also was cleared \\nof responsibility for four murders and three cases of mistreatment \\nor torture of prisoners. Delic was cleared of two murders, and of \\ncommand responsibility for other killings at Celebici. He was also \\nacquitted of three cases of torture. Landzo was cleared of one murder \\ncharge and one torture count. The tribunal, set up by the Security \\nCouncil in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial \\n_ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years \\nfor killing and torturing Muslims in 1992. Two other men have confessed \\nto killing Muslims, handing the tribunal two more convictions without \\nconduction trials. \\n\\nHundreds of people gathered at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome \\nZejnil Delalic, who was cleared of war crimes charges earlier this \\nweek after spending 980 days in jail of the international war crimes \\ntribunal in The Hague. Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of \\nwar crimes committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led \\nBosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic. Three \\nothers involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison \\nterms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp guards. Delalic held \\nup his verdict as he arrived and was first greeted by his family and \\nthen by many friends from Konjic, 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of \\nSarajevo, where a huge welcome party for him was planned. ``This is \\nthe book of 500 pages in which it says 12 times Delalic is not guilty,'' \\nhe told reporters. ``More important is that acts commited by some \\nweren't ordered by officers of our Bosnian Army. These acts were qualified \\nas acts of individuals that happened on a daily basis,'' he said. \\nEdina Residovic, Delalic's lawyer, said she will seek compensation \\nfor wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Delalic, who spent almost three \\nyears in confinement. \\n\\nHe called himself the ``Serb Adolf,'' and his crimes were as chilling \\nas his nickname. In a trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes \\ntribunal, U.N. prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge \\npanel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most serious \\noffense. The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in \\nOctober to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing many \\nobservers by reversing his earlier declarations of innocence. Although \\nhis guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes \\nagainst humanity _ and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence _ \\nJelisic has denied that the killing spree constituted genocide. By \\npressing on with a genocide trial, prosecutors will be able to call \\nevidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the \\ninvolvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors \\nof his ruthless campaign a chance to tell their story in court. To \\nconvict Jelisic of genocide, prosecutors must prove that the murders \\n_ most of them carried out with close-range shots from an automatic \\npistol _ were part of a campaign intended to wipe out an entire ethnic \\ngroup in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko. Jelisic, who was arrested \\nin January by U.S. troops serving in the NATO force in Bosnia, has \\npleaded guilty to a total of 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against \\nhumanity. The charges cover the murders as well as three beatings \\nand the plundering of property. In entering those guilty pleas, Jelisic \\ntold the tribunal he wanted to ``cleanse my soul.'' He will officially \\nbe convicted of those charges during the genocide trial. Jelisic's \\nvictims were killed in or near the Serb-run Luka prison camp, a former \\nport complex on the banks of the Sava River. Although most victims \\nwere men, Jelisic also clubbed one female inmate with a police baton \\nand then fatally shot her. U.N. prosecutors say Jelisic identified \\nhimself to prisoners as the ``Serb Adolf,'' a reference to Hitler, \\nand bragged about the number of Muslims he had killed. Set up in 1993, \\nthe U.N. court has convicted three Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and \\na Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but \\nit has yet to register a genocide conviction. An earlier genocide \\ntrial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, \\ndied of a ruptured artery in his tribunal cell. \\n\\nThe president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized \\nBelgrade authorities anew for refusing to let U.N. investigators probe \\nalleged atrocities in Kosovo. In a letter to the United Nations Security \\nCouncil released Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle \\nKirk McDonald of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav officials \\nto grant visas to investigators is ``an affront.'' ``The intentional \\nand continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply \\nwith its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal \\nis an affront to the Security Council and all law-abiding nations,'' \\nshe said. The Texas judge fired off the letter last Friday following \\nthe refusal of Belgrade authorities to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor \\nLouise Arbour of Canada and a team of investigators to visit Kosovo. \\nMcDonald asked the Security Council to impose ``measures which are \\nsufficiently compelling to bring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \\ninto the fold of law-abiding nations.'' Hundreds of people, mostly \\nethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000 driven \\nfrom their homes since February, when Serb forces began a crackdown \\non ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. The tribunal wants to look \\ninto allegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict. \\n\\nTo his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of \\ngenocide'' who once bragged that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims \\nbefore his morning coffee.'' Opening a genocide trial Monday at the \\nYugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the \\n30-year-old mechanic used the nickname Adolf ``with a perverse pride \\nin the genocidal symbolism it represented.'' Jelisic pleaded guilty \\nin October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run \\nLuka camp set up in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992. By trying \\nhim for genocide, prosecutors will be able to call evidence about \\nthe background of Jelisic's murders, including the involvement of \\nmore senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors of his killing \\nspree chance to tell their story in court. Bowers told a three-judge \\ntribunal panel that Jelisic admitted in interviews with investigators \\nto far more killings than the dozen to which he has pleaded guilty. \\nJelisic will be convicted of those murders and sentenced at the end \\nof his trial, which is expected to last well into 1999. He faces a \\nmaximum sentence of life imprisonment. ``We will never be able to \\nfix the exact number'' of victims, Bowers said. ``But if we are to \\nbelieve even a small percentage of the totals which Goran Jelisic \\nclaimed, then his victims certainly number well over 100.'' As the \\ntrial began, judges were read excerpts of a psychological report which \\nstated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial but suffered a \\n``borderline personality disorder.'' Wearing a striped sweater and \\nblack jeans, Jelisic brought a laptop computer into court and took \\nnotes. When he wasn't writing, Jelisic sat slightly slumped in his \\nchair, his head still, looking impassively around the courtroom. Jelisic's \\ncampaign of murder stands out _ even at a tribunal set up to deal \\nexclusively with atrocities _ for its cold-bloodedness. ``Once Goran \\nJelisic even declined assistance from a guard, noting that he was \\nstill in `good form' even though he had killed over 60 people,'' Bowers \\ntold judges, citing statements made by witnesses due to testify later \\nin the trial. ``To victims in Brcko, the face of genocide was the \\nface of Goran Jelisic,'' he said. Bowers told the judges that Jelisic, \\nwho held no official rank, was released by Bosnian Serb authorities \\nfrom jail, where he was serving three years for fraud, and sent to \\nBrcko to murder Muslims. He told investigators that on his arrival \\nin the town, which was of strategic importance to Bosnian Serbs, he \\nwas given a list of Muslim targets and ordered to kill as many as \\npossible. Jelisic, Bowers said, seemed to relish the task. ``Witness \\ntestimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic was not a reluctant \\ntool of the genocide who was being compelled by Serb authorities to \\nact against his will,'' the U.S. prosecutor said. ``Quite to the contrary, \\nthe testimony will firmly establish that Goran Jelisic was an efficient \\nand enthusiastic participant in the genocide.'' Set up in 1993, the \\nU.N. court has convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian \\nSerb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but it has \\nyet to register a genocide conviction. An earlier genocide trial was \\nhalted when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a \\nruptured artery in his tribunal cell. \\n\", \"\\nCaught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factories \\nfear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end \\nbonus. So they're considering paying with products instead of cash. \\nSome workplaces have already offered their employees such things as \\nhammers, nails, screws and bolts instead of the traditional cash bonus \\nthat normally is equivalent to one month's wage, said the head of \\nBrazil's largest federation of trade unions. ``The idea is completely \\nunacceptable,'' said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general of the \\nfederation, which represents more than 2,000 unions and 19 million \\nworkers. ``We will recommend our unions reject such a preposterous \\nproposal.'' But strapped for cash and punished by high interest rates \\nand declining sales, factory owners may have no other choice, said \\nJoseph Curi, president of the Sao Paulo State Association of Small \\nIndustries, which represents 110,000 factories that employ nearly \\n800,000 workers. ``Access to credit is almost impossible,'' Curi said. \\n``If banks and the government don't create some kind of emergency \\ncredit line, the only option many of our associates will have will \\nbe to use products to pay the bonus.'' Factories that produce clothes, \\nshoes, food, toys and household appliances were ``the most enthusiastic \\nabout the idea,'' Curi said. Curi predicted even harsher times for \\nBrazil with the belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected \\nPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to announce Tuesday. \\nThe measures, aimed at curbing the country's ballooning budget deficit \\n_ equal to about 7 percent of gross domestic product _ are expected \\nto include spending cuts and, possibly, more taxes. ``There is a lot \\nof talk of increasing taxes, which means less cash circulating in \\nthe market and more credit restrictions,'' Curi said. ``It is a shortsighted \\napproach that will spell more recession and the collapse of many small \\nfactories.'' Brazil has been a major casualty of the global economic \\ncrisis, buffeted by loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow \\nof capital. The country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs \\n50 billion, from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. In an effort \\nto prevent a collapse of the nation's currency, the real, and stem \\ncapital flight, interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year. For \\nunion leader Felicio, the proposed product-for-cash swap ``is a clear \\nsign of the despair the business sector is feeling because of the \\nrecessive economic policies'' brought by the Real Plan, the economic \\nstabilization program put together in 1994 when Cardoso was finance \\nminister. The plan succeeded in slashing inflation from 2,400 percent \\nto almost zero today. But it also brought recession and unemployment, \\nwhich now stands at almost 8 percent, the highest in a decade. \\n\\nBrazilian officials ended four days of meetings with representatives \\nof the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday without living up to \\ntheir public pledge to announce concrete measures to reduce government \\ndeficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the \\nBrazilian Finance Ministry, offered only details on Brazil's plans \\nfor raising a primary account surplus over the next three years. With \\nonly five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs on Sunday, neither \\nhe nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in Brasilia, said how \\nthe government planned to achieve the savings. Important allies of \\nCardoso are lagging behind in three key states, and despite the government \\npromises, market analysts did not expect an announcement until after \\nthe elections. Instead, the strategy in Brasilia and Washington appeared \\nto focus on reassuring the markets that work on cutting the deficit \\nwas going forward, without providing fodder for opponents in domestic \\nelections. ``The discussions continue with the objective of reaching \\nagreement soon on the detailed program,'' said a joint statement by \\nthe IMF and the Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because of Brazil's enormous \\ndeficits, the collapse of emerging markets has hit the nation particularly \\nhard, draining foreign currency reserves and pushing the economy toward \\nrecession. Finance officials in Washington and around the world fear \\nthat a collapse of Brazil, because of its size and links to other \\neconomies, would worsen financial instability throughout the hemisphere. \\nWith 160 million people, Brazil represents the world's ninth-largest \\neconomy and is the financial engine of Latin America. Throughout the \\nday, government officials met with Cardoso in Brasilia and were expected \\nto fine-tune a three-year austerity package that Cardoso was to discuss \\nwith congressional party leaders on Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, \\nofficials said that among the measures being considered were a tax \\nincrease on financial transactions, to three-tenths of a percent from \\ntwo-tenths of a percent, and extending the Fiscal Stabilization Fund, \\nwhich sets aside 20 percent of all taxes collected for presidential \\ndiscretionary spending. The fund was to have expired by 1999. Speaking \\nin Washington, Parente said that Brazil would aim toward a surplus \\nof 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. \\nIt had already been announced, at the end of the IMF's annual meeting \\nin Washington two weeks ago that Brazil would have to reach a primary \\naccount surplus of 2.5 percent to 3 percent to qualify for IMF aid. \\nThe primary account covers government expenses, without interest payments \\non debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan \\nStanley Dean Witter, said signs that the Brazilian government and \\nthe IMF were moving closer to an aid package were reassuring, and \\nthat he did not expect much more than reassurance until next week. \\n``I call this the `We have a pope' scenario,'' Brown said. ``You're \\njust going to hear that we have a pope, maybe see the white smoke \\nrising,'' he said, ``and not figure out who the pope is until after \\nthe elections.'' \\n\\nLatin American leaders flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit \\nto figure out how they can shield their economies from the global \\nfinancial crisis. Not since the early 1980s have so many countries \\nbeen in recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's \\ndeveloping economies. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, \\ndescribed the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important \\nissue facing the world at the moment. ``I don't know if we are coming \\nto the end of the world economic order. It will be interesting to \\nknow,'' the Cuban leader said at a hotel press conference shortly \\nafter his arrival for the annual Ibero-American summit. Emphasizing \\nthe scale of the threat, Castro said President Clinton was aware that \\n``if South America falls into crisis, it will be extended inevitably \\nalso to the United States,'' which is heavily involved in investments \\nand loans in the region. Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash \\nout of Latin America with devastating effects on stock markets and \\ncurrency reserves. The heads of state and government from Latin America, \\nSpain and Portugal will explore measures to ward off the financial \\nturmoil that already has devastated Asia and Russia. Stock markets \\nalso fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investors in Latin America. \\nThe Latin American leaders must gauge the need for unpopular reforms \\nof their public finances, including austerity packages which risk \\nsocial unrest and political upheaval. A joint declaration will be \\nsigned Sunday in this ancient port city on the Douro River in northern \\nPortugal. Diplomats said there was consensus on the form of the final \\nstatement. The declaration ``calls on the international community, \\nand Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary \\nmeasures to promote stability in international financial markets, \\nwhich is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,'' said \\nLuis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin \\nAmerica's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory system for \\nglobal financial transactions that would place controls on speculators, \\nlike measures to slow down the internatioal flow of money. They also \\nwant reforms that allow international financial institutions to head \\noff crises rather than react to them with rescue packages. ``International \\ninstitutions must be active in tackling crises like the recent one \\n... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime \\nGama said. ``Countries that have progressive policies should not be \\npenalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in reference \\nto Latin American nations' efforts to modernize their economies. Brazil, \\nthe continent's largest economy and a potential bulwark against creeping \\nrecession, is waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion bailout package \\nfrom the International Monetary Fund. The presidents of the World \\nBank and InterAmerican Development Bank also were expected at the \\ntalks. The move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates \\nThursday revived Latin America's financial markets, but analysts expected \\nthe reprieve to be short-lived because of deep concerns about the \\ncontinent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stemmed \\nin part from the structural weaknesses of Latin American economies. \\nA strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a government \\nausterity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that could arise \\nif tough reforms are introduced. Brazil is drafting an austerity package \\nthat will hit public spending, especially social security. \\n\\nThe United States is preparing to commit U.S. taxpayer funds as part \\nof a lending program of at least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, \\nand with it the rest of Latin America, from the worst effects of the \\nfinancial turmoil circling the globe, according to U.S. and foreign \\nofficials assembling the program. Details of the U.S. contribution, \\nwhich is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or \\nloan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated. But several congressional \\nleaders have been alerted to the likelihood that the administration \\nwould have to act while Congress is in recess. This early warning \\nfrom the administration reflects memories of how Congress erupted \\nwith objections and hearings in 1995 when President Clinton committed \\n$20 billion in U.S. funds to the bailout of Mexico. But administration \\nofficials said last week that their early soundings indicate that \\nmembers of Congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic \\ncollapse in Latin America that would resound in the United States, \\nand thus they expect few objections. The timing of an aid package \\nfor Brazil _ originally expected within the next few days _ is complicated \\nby unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the Brazilian \\ngovernment. The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso \\nfaces politically risky gubernatorial elections on Sunday, which may \\nwell determine whether Brazil can execute an austerity program that \\nis the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating \\nwith the International Monetary Fund. The biggest role in the rescue \\nprogram for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund, \\nwhich said last week that it would contribute at least $15 billion \\n_ and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even \\nmore. Another $9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the \\nInter-American Development Bank, and the remainder from the United \\nStates and other major industrial nations. Germany and Japan, though, \\nhave been reluctant to take part, one U.S. official noted, suggesting \\nthat Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. \\nSo far, U.S. officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid \\npackage have said nothing in public about the details of plans for \\na direct contribution to Brazil. ``Brazil is very important to the \\neconomic well-being of the region, the United States and the international \\ncommunity, and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can \\nbe helpful,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Friday. But \\nin a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil, Rubin \\ndeclined to say what strategy he would pursue in dealing with Brazil's \\nproblems and insisted that no decisions had been made about how the \\nUnited States might contribute. But he discussed Brazil as an opportunity \\nto engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that President \\nClinton advocated in speeches to the IMF and the World Bank here three \\nweeks ago. At the time, Clinton argued that the monetary fund should \\n``provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial \\ncontagion'' rather than wait for disaster to strike. Direct U.S. aid \\nto Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year \\nof trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, \\nthe United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own \\ncapital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for Brazil but \\nto stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that \\nare major U.S. trading partners. That would be a change of strategy. \\nSo far, the United States has operated almost entirely through international \\nfinancial institutions, chiefly the IMF But it would also be a risky \\nmove for President Clinton, economically and politically. Even though \\nCongress objected to the $20 billion in U.S. funds committed to the \\nbailout of Mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion was ultimately \\nneeded, and it has since been paid back, with interest. But Rubin \\nnoted on Friday that ``it's a very different environment now.'' Other \\nadministration officials say they believe that there would be few \\nobjections in Congress to direct U.S. participation in a Brazil bailout. \\n``I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared \\nto death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen \\nin their own districts,'' a White House official said last week, ``and \\nthey won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it.'' By \\nacting soon to stabilize Latin America, the administration is hoping \\nto capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer \\npanic that engulfed Russia and, at its height, led to an outflow of \\na billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the \\nnext country forced to devalue its currency. Whether this calm marks \\nthe beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires \\nthat have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is \\na matter of considerable debate. But many experts cite the confluence \\nof several events that have reassured jittery investors around the \\nworld: two successive interest-rate cuts in the United States, Japan's \\nlong-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion \\nin taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, \\nIndonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing \\nto return. Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly \\non markets, Rubin acknowledged that ``in the last several weeks there \\nhave been a number of significant, positive developments.'' But the \\nformer trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market \\nrallies, warned that ``serious issues remain'' and that ``it will \\ntake some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has \\nrepeatedly called ``the most serious international financial disruption \\nof the last 50 years.'' In fact, Rubin's aides are clearly nervous \\nabout the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new \\nround of panic, which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market \\ncountries to borrow money on world markets. ``Brazil and Japan are \\nthe two obvious tinderboxes,'' said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale \\nSchool of Management, who served as undersecretary of commerce for \\ninternational affairs during Clinton's first term. ``In Brazil, the \\nissue is whether the package that is coming together will really be \\nbig enough to deal with an exploding debt problem. And in Japan the \\nquestion is whether there is real reform that goes along with the \\nmoney.'' But after spending 18 months in negotiations with the Japanese, \\nRubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in \\nTokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not \\nlack of resources. In Brazil, though, the United States has a better \\nchance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, \\nas long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Cardoso \\nand his team. But demonstrating economic support will probably require \\ntapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt \\nadministration to help stabilize the dollar. The money is under Rubin's \\ncontrol, with presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent \\ncongressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995. But the reaction \\nwas so strong _ for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for \\ninternational bailouts _ that Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious \\never since. He committed $3 billion in a ``second line of defense'' \\nin emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year, \\nbut no money was ultimately dispersed to either country. U.S. officials \\nsaid that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse \\nof the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the political scene \\nthere that it would be too risky to offer direct U.S. aid. In the \\nbailout of Russia _ whose economy collapsed after President Boris \\nYeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed \\nthe leading reformers _ the United States offered no direct help. \\nThose events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging \\nmarkets, and greatly worsened Brazil's troubles. So far, Brazilian \\nofficials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking \\nabout a forthcoming aid program from the IMF, convincing speculators \\nthat it would be dangerous to bet against the country. But at the \\nsame time, the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they \\ndo not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get \\nit. U.S. officials and top officials of the IMF are clearly nervous, \\nworried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater will \\nbe the risk of Brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil. \\n``The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control,'' \\nsaid an investment banker involved in the talks. ``But the fact is \\nthat there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months \\nthe government is going to be forced to devalue'' its currency, which \\nis pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a \\ncarefully controlled fall. To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian \\ngovernment has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, \\nchoking off credit for most companies. Meanwhile, the country is slipping \\ninto recession. The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it \\nis contingent on Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to \\nend huge deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending. \\nThe first deputy managing director for the International Monetary \\nFund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's \\nausterity plan, which is expected to be announced after Sunday's elections \\nbut before the international package, to avoid the appearance that \\nthe global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil. ``Brazil has \\nto do a lot,'' Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip. \\n``In return, I expect the international community will make a large \\ncontribution.'' \\n\\nBrazil and the International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday to \\nagreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's \\nninth-largest economy. A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian \\ngovernment said the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its \\nbudget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product \\nto zero by 2000. The statement was issued after weekend talks between \\nIMF officials and a Brazilian delegation headed by Pedro Parente, \\nexecutive secretary of the Finance Ministry. Representatives of the \\nWorld Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank took part in the \\ntalks. Both organizations as well as private banks are expected to \\ncontribute to the rescue package. Brazil is the latest country to \\nbe hit by the financial crisis that began 15 months ago in Asia and \\nthen spread to Russia. Brazil has lost about dlrs 25 billion in foreign \\ncurrency reserves since August when Russia defaulted on its debts \\nand sparked a new crisis of confidence in emerging market countries. \\nIf instability continues in Brazil it could affect Argentina, its \\nmain trading partner, and other Latin American economies. Despite \\nthe re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term as \\npresident and the announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and the IMF had \\nagreed on the broad outlines of a financial assistance package, investors \\ncontinued to withdraw large sums of money from Brazil. Cardoso is \\npreparing an emergency program of budget cuts to restore investor \\nconfidence and prevent a devaluation of the country's currency. Investors \\nwant Cardoso to outline the plans this week but he is expected to \\nwait until after Sunday's second round of elections for state governors, \\nwhose support he needs for his budget cuts. The joint statement said \\nthe Brazil-IMF discussions ``were aimed at preparing the ground for \\nprompt support by the international community, including the IMF, \\nfor the multi-year fiscal program to be announced soon by the Brazilian \\nauthorities, which will include new policy initiatives.'' The statement \\nreiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary budget surplus of \\n2.6 percent of its gross domestic product in 1999, 2.8 percent in \\n2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would '' fulfill the government \\ntarget of stabilizing the ratio of net consolidated public sector \\ndebt to GDP by the year 2000.'' The two sides are to continue their \\ntalks ``with the objective of reaching early agreement,'' the statement \\nsaid. \\n\\nThere's no such thing as a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President \\nFernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers. No haircuts \\nor phone calls, either. Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso \\nwants to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning \\nby paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential \\npalace in Brasilia, the capital. Sure, it's not much when compared \\nwith a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of economic output. \\nBut as Cardoso readies a package of spending cuts and tax increases, \\nhe clearly wants to show Brazilians that economy starts at home. So \\ngoodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwiches, fruit and juice, \\na palace tradition. Three barber shops in the palace were closed, \\nand the use of cellular phones and copiers was restricted.

Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy \\nbattered by the world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the \\nfull scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed to \\ninclude a spate of new taxes on fuel, income, personal fortunes and \\nbank transactions.

Federal money would \\nautomatically be cut off if spending gets out of hand. \\n\\nPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts to repair the largest \\neconomy in Latin America may depend on the outcome of this weekend's \\ngubernatorial elections. Cardoso wants to impose tough measures that \\nwould slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt \\nthe slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. But \\nhis plan, expected to be unveiled next week, must be approved by Congress, \\nand state governors have enormous sway over local delegations. ``The \\ninfluence governors have on their congressional blocs is overwhelming,'' \\nsaid University of Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas. \\nBrazil has been caught up in the financial turmoil that began more \\nthan a year ago in Southeast Asia. As wary investors have fled its \\nfinancial markets, Brazil's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs \\n50 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. On Sunday, voters \\nreturn to the polls for runoff elections in 12 states and in the Federal \\nDistrict of Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how successful \\nCardoso is in getting Congress to approve his economic program, which \\nis aimed at trimming the budget deficit. New income, fuel and bank \\ntransaction taxes are expected to be proposed. Kugelmas said opponents \\nof the president stand a good chance of winning in four large states \\n_ Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. ``If \\nthey win, the president will face a tough uphill battle,'' he said. \\nCardoso needs the governors' support not only in influencing the congressional \\ndelegations, but also in holding down their own spending. ``The problem \\nis that none of the candidates in Sunday's elections ... wants to \\nbe identified with unpopular austerity measures,'' said Kugelmas. \\n``So they promise to spend more money on schools, hospitals and public \\nwork projects.'' Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, \\nis perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity \\nplans. With more than 34 million inhabitants, nearly equal to the \\nentire population of neighboring Argentina, it alone accounts for \\nmore than one-third of Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513 \\ncongressional seats. While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso \\nally who is seeking re-election, has committed himself to the austerity \\nplan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is a question mark. ``If Maluf wins, \\nhe will use his victory as a launching pad to the presidency in 2003,'' \\nKugelmas predicted. ``And that means he will try to stay as far away \\nas possible from any austerity measure.'' \\n\\nLeaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing \\ntouches Saturday on an Ibero-American summit declaration warning of \\nglobal recession unless action is taken to stabilize the international \\nfinancial system. The draft declaration said recent financial market \\nturmoil shows that adjustments must be made quickly ``to keep the \\ndifficulties affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all.'' The \\ndeclaration addresses the world's seven richest nations. The Group \\nof Seven is composed of the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, \\nFrance, Italy and Canada. The final declaration will be approved at \\nSunday's summit in this port city in northern Portugal. Brazilian \\nPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that Brazil and \\nChina, two of the world's largest economies, had become the ``dikes \\nof resistance'' to global recession. Protecting their economies from \\nthe spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more countries \\nthan at any time since the early 1980s, is key to world economic stability, \\nhe said. Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and the eighth-largest \\nin the world, and its economic collapse could take the rest of the \\ncontinent with it. To halt Brazil's slide toward recession, Cardoso \\nis preparing austerity measures including spending cuts, tax hikes \\nand lower interest rates. The reforms would help Brazil qualify for \\nan International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 \\nbillion. The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling dlrs 137 \\nbillion since the financial crisis struck Thailand 15 months ago and \\nthen spread from Asia to Russia. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, \\naware of the impact that a Latin American recession would have on \\nthe United States, has actively pushed the IMF and the World Bank \\nto support Brazil after it was hit by investor flight. \\n\\nThe Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of \\nthe effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy, \\nreporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion \\nin August to $16.77 billion. That is the widest gap since the government \\nrecalculated the way it measures trade flows in 1992. It resulted \\nfrom a decline in American exports and a sharp increase in what this \\ncountry buys from abroad. So far this year, the trade deficit is running \\nroughly 50 percent above last year's levels and is up to a projected \\n$170 billion for the year, a gap that is expected to widen even further. \\nOne senior administration official who deals with economic issues, \\nspeaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that internal projections \\nsuggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a \\nfigure that he said ``will certainly cut into growth, and could well \\nbecome a major political problem.'' Trade deficits carry with them \\nboth good and troubling signals about the economy. The current flood \\nof imports is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest levels \\nin decades. And while sales of American aircraft, computer chips and \\nother goods are suffering, the weakening of the dollar on world markets \\nin recent weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for American \\nexporters. But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem \\nfacing American companies is the inability of many nations and some \\nlarge companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to \\nmake ordinary purchases. The result is such a freeze of economic activity \\nthat empty shipping containers are stacking up on American piers. \\nAnd the effects are hurting everyone from Midwest farmers who can \\nno longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East Coast fishermen \\nwho are discovering that Japan's appetite for salmon and lobster has \\nbeen ruined by the banking crisis. Among the most surprising elements \\nof Tuesday's report is that more than a third of August's deficit \\nwas with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst \\neffects of the global troubles: China. Despite continued growth of \\nthe Chinese economy, exports to China have slowed dramatically and \\nimports of Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately \\nseeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in \\nAsia. That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion, \\nlevels previously only seen in trade with Japan. The Chinese _ besieged \\nby floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient \\nbanking crisis _ have signaled to the United States in recent weeks \\nthat they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets \\nfurther in return for entry into the World Trade Organization. That \\namounts to a major setback for President Clinton, who for three years \\nhas been using the negotiations over China's entry to the world body \\nas the centerpiece of his effort to open China both economically and \\npolitically. Ostensible progress in this area has been cited by the \\nadministration until recently as one of the successes of the administration's \\nChina policy, but now officials say privately that the progress is \\nevaporating. The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American \\neconomy, and it was one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to \\nlower interest rates two times in recent weeks. So administration \\nofficials were going out of their way Tuesday to portray the numbers \\nas another warning sign, but not a crisis. ``While the United States \\nremains strong and sound, the troubled condition of the global marketplace \\ncontinue to strongly influence the U.S. trade balance,'' Commerce \\nSecretary Williams Daley said in a statement Tuesday. After China, \\nthe biggest deterioration in the American trade balance in August \\ncame in Mexico, where the peso has weakened markedly as economic contagion \\nhas spread through Latin America. Exports to Mexico have remained \\nunchanged. But imports from Mexico have increased markedly _ chiefly \\nautomobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment \\n_ as American manufacturers have taken advantage of the weakening \\ncurrency. In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest \\nfocus of concern by the administration and the International Monetary \\nFund, barely budged from the same period a year ago. Normally, that \\nwould be cited as a sign of continued demand for American products \\nin Latin America's largest economy, but there is fear it might be \\nimperiled. The news comes as the United States and the IMF complete \\na bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help \\nit stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through \\nAsia, Russia and several other nations. Tuesday the IMF and Brazil \\nreached agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and \\nnext, a sign that the aid will likely be announced after elections \\nin Brazil this weekend. But for all these potential problems, the \\nrising trade deficit has barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill. Because \\nthe rising level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment \\nhere, the subject has barely come up in races for the House and Senate \\naround the country. The only exception has been in regions where the \\nsteel industry is strong. The major steel companies have charged in \\nrecent weeks that Asian nations are dumping products on the American \\nmarket at prices well below their costs. The Commerce Department has \\nbegun an inquiry. The Commerce Department's numbers showed that the \\ndeficit rose 15.3 percent to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised \\nfigure of $14.55 billion in July. The department said that the resumption \\nof production at General Motors Corp. after last summer's strike may \\nhave increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, as GM brought \\nin parts from abroad. The deficit was the highest since the Commerce \\nDepartment began a new method of tracking trade information in 1992. \\nExports, the department said, fell three tenths of 1 percent, to about \\n$74.8 billion. Imports rose 2.2 percent to $91.6 billion. \\n\", \"\\nThis is what Newt Gingrich is supposed to do well. The planning. The \\nstrategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought the GOP \\nto the majority in Congress in 1994 and made him the first Republican \\nHouse Speaker in 40 years. But by his own admission, Gingrich's vision \\nseems to have blurred this time around, costing Republicans a net \\nof five seats in Tuesday's election and leaving the party's narrow \\ngoverning majority even narrower. The disappointing election results \\nalso left Gingrich open to a fractious challenge for his post as speaker. \\nMembers and aides said Wednesday that a fury at the speaker had bubbled \\nup overnight and that some members were trying to organize a slate \\nof candidates to replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House \\nRepublicans convene on Nov. 18 to select their leaders for next year. \\nAs Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, ``When a company's stock price \\ngoes down, it's usually the CEO who gets fired.'' Top Republican aides, \\nspeaking anonymously, were even blunter. ``People were very angry \\nlast night,'' one aide said. ``Today it's a mixture of seething and \\ndismay. It's just ugly. And Newt knows it. His career is on the line.'' \\nAnother aide said, ``Most people are really angry with Newt, and no \\none knows what to do with it. But some are dipping their toe in the \\nwater and seeing what the temperature is.'' A possible slate could \\ncontain the names of Reps. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana to replace \\nGingrich, Steve Largent of Oklahoma to replace Dick Armey of Texas \\nas majority leader, and Jennifer Dunn of Washington to replace John \\nA. Boehner of Ohio as conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh \\nof Indiana is also said to be considering a run for speaker, but it \\nwas not clear whether he would be part of any slate. Rep. Tom DeLay \\nof Texas, the majority whip, was said to be secure. Armey bluntly \\nacknowledged the scramble going on in the wings to oust the leadership. \\nTold on ``Nightline'' that there were Republicans after his head, \\nArmey replied: ``They're welcome to it if they're big enough to take \\nit.'' Publicly, Gingrich has expressed confidence about keeping his \\njob as speaker. But he has been grim-faced over the last 24 hours \\nand closeted himself Wednesday with his top strategists making calls \\nto shore up his support among members. ``He looks like the victim \\nof an accident,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who supports Gingrich. \\n``He's very somber in tone.'' The question, as it always is with Gingrich, \\nis how many members are prepared to rebel against his leadership. \\nIn the past, no more than a couple of dozen members have openly expressed \\ntheir dissatisfaction with him, and a coup attempt last year fizzled \\nfor lack of support. ``I'm hoping more people will understand the \\nneed for a serious reassessment this year,'' said Rep. Charles T. \\nCanady, R-Fla., who said he had hoped for a challenge to the speaker \\nafter the 1996 elections, when the Republicans also lost seats. ``The \\nreality is this: Our majority keeps shrinking,'' Canady said. ``If \\nit shrinks any more, it will be gone.'' But Gingrich has built support \\namong moderates, and some perceived the election as a repudiation \\nof the conservatives. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said the \\nresults showed that this was the right direction for the party. ``To \\nmaintain our majority, we've got to moderate some of our views,'' \\nBoehlert said. Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings \\nInstitution, said that moderates supported Gingrich in part because \\nno appealing alternative had emerged. ``They know he sees the broader \\nworld and is prepared to moderate if it makes sense,'' Mann said. \\n``Newt's gone out of his way to support the moderates. He's nurtured \\na relationship with them.'' But Mann and others said that anger has \\nbeen building at Gingrich for several reasons, including his signing \\non to a budget deal last month that seemed to capitulate to President \\nClinton, not offering a clear legislative agenda for Republicans and \\nnot communicating a clear political message. ``We are most defined \\nby who we hate'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. ``But voters are more \\nsophisticated than that, and Republicans better have something to \\nsay about where we're going.'' The anger grew in the last few days \\nwhen the speaker approved a $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign \\nthat allowed Democrats to turn the election into a referendum on Gingrich, \\nwho has never been nearly as popular with the public as Clinton has \\nbeen. As if only slowly absorbing the implications of the loss, the \\nspeaker seemed unable at a news conference here Wednesday morning \\nto pinpoint why the party suffered a net drop of five seats in the \\nHouse. As late as Tuesday afternoon, he was predicting a net pickup \\nof between 10 and 30. ``Until we look at it better, I frankly don't \\nunderstand all the things that happened yesterday,'' he said, ``and \\nI'm not sure anybody else in the country does either.'' But he said \\nRepublicans should have ``maniacally focused'' on a basic message \\nof cutting taxes, saving Social Security and preventing drug abuse, \\nand campaigned aggressively on those themes. He contrasted the lack \\nof focus this year with the Contract With America that proved so successful \\nin 1994. ``People thought we stood for something pretty big,'' he \\nsaid. But Gingrich also seemed aware of the mounting concern about \\nhis leadership, repeatedly casting the election results as a victory \\nfor his leadership team because Republicans had stayed in the majority \\nfor three elections in a row for the first time in 70 years. He also \\nsuggested that those who would challenge him have little support. \\n``The people who normally are quoted on this are people who would \\nin fact take the party to a narrower base,'' Gingrich said, referring \\nto the periodic eruptions of concern among conservatives about his \\nleadership. ``I'd like to see who it was that had a plan that they \\nwere confident over the last 60 days would have been more successful \\nand why they didn't share it.'' \\n\\nJust four years ago, it was a good bet that Newt Gingrich would be \\nthe pivotal figure in U.S. politics at the turn of the millennium. \\nSeemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority party and turned \\nit into a pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With a promise to \\nbalance the budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social \\nvalues, he appeared to have rearranged the political map for Congress \\njust as Ronald Reagan had done for the presidency. But Gingrich's \\nleadership is now so shaky that even if he maintains his hold on the \\nspeaker's office, he is in danger of marginalization. A change this \\ndramatic suggests something far more profound than a miscalculation \\nabout election tactics. What looked like one of the major realignments \\nin U.S. political history might turn out to have been nothing but \\na temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution was fueled by anger, a \\nrevolt of white working-class Americans against what they perceived \\nas a Democratic bias in favor of blacks and other minorities, and \\na middle-class rejection of the politics of big government and big \\ndeficits. They were the same resentments that Ronald Reagan had exploited \\nso successfully. But old political habits and a moribund Republican \\nleadership allowed the Democrats to retain control of Congress throughout \\nthe 1980s, and turned Reagan's economic program into an undisciplined \\ntax-cutting spree that created prosperity along with huge budget gaps. \\nGingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent for political \\norganization finally took Reagan's formula for success to the congressional \\nelections in 1994. But once in power, he ran head on into Bill Clinton, \\nwhose political instincts were even better. The president co-opted \\nparts of the Contract With America, particularly the balanced budget \\nand welfare reform. He adapted the Republican social message into \\na call for things like school uniforms and television rating systems, \\nwhich symbolized more responsibility and parental control without \\nsupporting government intrusion into private lives. The Republican \\nright's genuine contempt for Clinton was based in part on the well-known \\nflaws in the president's character. But it was mainly a reaction to \\nthe ease with which he had diverted what was supposed to be the flood \\ntide of their revolution. They expected that the genuine successes \\nof Gingrich's first year in office would lead to still larger victories \\nfor minimal government and taxes, unfettered free enterprise and a \\nreturn to conservative Christian values. But the public was happy \\nto be led in another direction, and focus on the concerns of aging \\nbaby boomers about health care and Social Security. The government \\nthat was seen as the enemy when the issues were budgetary once again \\nlooked like a potential ally. Back in 1994, both parties were so stunned \\nby the sudden change in their congressional fortunes that they may \\nhave overestimated what it all meant. In particular they may not have \\nrealized how quickly good economic times, a drop in crime and national \\nwelfare reform could blunt the power of race in U.S. politics. The \\nDemocrats had become literally a minority party as white voters resentfully \\nidentified their policies with cities, blacks and immigrants. But \\nlast week union workers and Catholics returned to the Democratic fold. \\nWithout race as a wedge issue, the solid black Democratic vote became \\na powerful advantage in key states. Blacks, women and Latinos angry \\nat Republican anti-immigration initiatives were the winning coalition \\nin California, North Carolina and New York. The speaker was right \\nto say this was ``not the election we expected.'' There may indeed \\nbe a Republican majority in America, but it appears to resemble the \\nRepublicanism of Dwight Eisenhower rather than Newt Gingrich _ pro-business, \\nwary of debt and with an inherent distaste for bringing up messy social \\nissues like abortion. The Republicans who have begun talking about \\n``compassionate conservatism'' and ``the politics of inclusion'' may \\nbe peddling political mush, but they peddled it to victory on Tuesday. \\nThe congressional Republican Party's long sojourn in the wilderness \\nof the House minority may have left it too accustomed to opposition \\nto figure out what it can be for, and too attached to the politics \\nof anger to make sense of a nation in the mood for moderation. Gingrich \\nhas suggested that his mistake was to let the Republicans drift along \\non the politics of impeachment when they should have been ``almost \\nmaniacally focused'' on things like tax cuts. But looking maniacal \\nis what got them into trouble in the first place. Winning control \\nof Congress after so many years was very tough for Gingrich in 1994. \\nBut it will be ten times tougher to forge a politics that does not \\ndepend on rage. \\n\\nA week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavowed \\nhis ``war'' on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's \\nformer campaign strategist and chief outside defender, put forth a \\nnew battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled. Not only that, but \\nCarville went beyond his customary denunciations of Gingrich and the \\nRepublicans and, in an interview, trained his fire on leaders in his \\nown party for not being sufficiently aggressive four weeks before \\nElection Day. ``My sense of frustration is that I believe the Democrats \\nhave a much better chance of doing much better than anyone expects,'' \\nCarville said. ``And I don't think anyone's emerging to try to pull \\nit together. Everybody ought to be pushing, the leadership in the \\nCongress, the White House, the DNC. We ought to hammer Gingrich every \\nday. How can you take the Congress back if you don't make a case against \\nthe people who are running it? I have never heard of a strategy like \\nthat.'' Sounding increasingly agitated, he went on: ``The only people \\nleft to be activated in this election are Democrats. The right wing, \\nthey're bouncing off the walls. They're going out to vote.'' Rep. \\nDick Gephardt, the minority leader, complained to Erskine Bowles, \\nthe White House chief of staff, after Carville appeared on the NBC \\nNews program ``Meet the Press'' on Sept. 27 and declared, ``Cpl. Cue \\nBall Carville will be rolling into battle against Newt Gingrich.'' \\nThe concern among House Democrats, one expressed by some White House \\nofficials as well, was that Carville's vitriol would make the Democrats \\nappear overly partisan and could be especially damaging to Democrats \\nin marginal districts who do not want to appear too easy on the president. \\nBut on Wednesday, Carville was anything but timid. ``If Gephardt people \\nthink they've quieted me down,'' he said, ``I'm not quieted.'' Carville \\nsaid he told officials at the White House, ``Don't waste your breath \\nabout calling me and telling me not to say this.'' Carville insisted \\nthat he would rather do battle with Republicans than with his fellow \\nDemocrats. ``If they want to fight with me, they can,'' he said. ``I'm \\ngoing to fight with the Republicans.'' Yet he could not help but ridicule \\nhis party. Asked to describe the Democrats' strategy for the election, \\nCarville said, ``If there is one, no one's shared it with me.'' \\n\\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the Republican revolution \\nof recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President \\nClinton, was driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned \\non him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's midterm elections. \\nCatching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise, Gingrich \\nannounced Friday night in two conference calls to other Republicans \\nthat he would not seek re-election as Speaker in the Nov. 18 vote \\nand would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January. \\n``This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is in \\nthe system,'' Gingrich said, according to a party aide who listened \\nto one of the calls. Gingrich's resignation was a stunning reversal \\nfor one of the most combative and personally confrontational politicians \\nin America. He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one Democratic \\nspeaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style through Tuesday's \\nelections with last-minute commercials reminding voters of the Clinton \\nscandal. His reflexive pugilistic response was evident even Friday \\nnight. In his second conference call, according to several people \\nwho listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall. \\nAlthough it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take control \\nof Congress in 1994, they have become his most bitter critics in the \\nlast two years of his tumultuous speakership. Friday night he called \\nthem cannibals who had ``blackmailed'' him into quitting. Rep. Michael \\nP. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: ``Newt said all those who had marginalized \\nthe Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism. He said, `Refer to \\nthe clips.' He's blaming others.'' Another Republican described the \\nconference call this way: ``He started off very statesmanlike, but \\nthen you could see the anger building. When someone asked him why \\nhe was leaving, he said, `A handful of members have blackmailed the \\nconference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.''' \\nGingrich announced his move just hours after Rep. Robert L. Livingston \\nof Louisiana announced he was running for speaker, putting himself \\nforward as a pragmatist and a manager. After the Gingrich calls, Rep. \\nBill Archer of Texas announced he was considering his own run for \\nspeaker. Livingston and Archer are chairmen of the two most powerful \\ncommittees in the House. In a statement Gingrich said, ``The Republican \\nconference needs to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward.'' \\nHe said he hoped his colleagues would pick a successor ``who can both \\nreconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively.'' \\nReferring to his wife, he told his colleagues he was resigning from \\nCongress because ``Marianne and I are tired. We need time off to get \\nto know each other again.'' He also acknowledged his own knack for \\nbringing negative attention to himself and his party. ``If I stay,'' \\nhe told his colleagues Friday night, ``my controversial nature would \\novershadow any successes we might have,'' an understatement to those \\nwho recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown \\nof the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the \\nback of Air Force One on a trip with President Clinton. According \\nto another Republican who took notes, Gingrich said of his resignation: \\n``There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the members. So long \\nas I am around, I will always be a target in the news media, which \\nwould mean we would never be able to get our message out.'' Clinton \\nsaid: ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary leading the Republican \\nParty to a majority in the House and joining me in a great national \\ndebate over how best to prepare America for the 21st century. Despite \\nour profound differences, I appreciate those times we were able to \\nwork together in the national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's \\nstrong support for America's continuing leadership for freedom, peace \\nand prosperity in the world.'' Many Republicans took the opportunity \\nto portray Gingrich as a visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New \\nYork said that during the first conference call, ``there was shock \\nand surprise and strong expressions of appreciation for leading us \\nto the Promised Land.'' His supporters said Gingrich had the votes \\nto win the election to nominate a speaker, which is to be conducted \\nby secret ballot. But, they agreed, the party's slim, six-vote majority \\nmeant every vote would be a battle. Kenneth Duberstein, a former official \\nin the Reagan administration, said, ``I have no doubt he had the votes \\nto be speaker, but I'm not sure he had the votes to govern.'' He said \\nthat because of the deep rifts in the party, Gingrich would not have \\nbeen able to implement his plans. In an unusually biting reaction, \\nRep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he hoped \\nthat Gingrich's resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that \\nhe had fostered. ``I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as speaker \\nwill immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was \\nwrought on this institution over the last four years,'' Gephardt said. \\nHouse Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would set \\noff a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than had \\nbeen anticipated. ``There will be a lot of pretenders to the throne \\nwho will test the waters,'' said Boehlert, who had supported Gingrich \\nfor re-election as speaker. ``There won't be any shortage of candidates.'' \\n\\nStunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional \\nRepublicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for \\ntheir failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an \\noff-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility \\nof congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results \\nshowed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold \\nover the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in the \\nHouse. The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that \\nthe president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and \\nit whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes. \\nThe Democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political \\nyear marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair \\nwith Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming \\na Democrat leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent, \\namounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican-controlled \\nCongress of 1953, the last time Republicans controlled the House until \\nthey captured it again in 1994. With attention now shifting to the \\nHouse Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry \\nHyde told fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday \\nthat the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be the \\nindependent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, told lawmakers \\nhe hoped to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment \\nby Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands \\nand put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday \\nuntil they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying to put \\nthe best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, \\nGa., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three elections \\nin a row for the first time since the election of 1932. But furious \\nrank and file Republicans burned up the phone lines to each other, \\ndiscussing whether to mount leadership challenges in both chambers \\nin the next few weeks. ``We've got to reach out and have more than \\nsouthern white males running the Washington Republican Party,'' said \\nRep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He said that Republicans \\nthis year had been left without any accomplishments to run on. ``We \\nneed an agenda first of all,'' he said. ``We went an entire calendar \\nyear without an agenda.'' Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut \\ncalled the election a devastating loss and said simply, ``There are \\ngoing to be major changes in our leadership. All segments of our party \\nwant to see change.'' At the White House, Clinton called the election \\nresults a vindication of his party's policies. ``If you look at all \\nthe results,'' he said, ``they are clear and unambiguous. The American \\npeople want their business, their concerns, their children, their \\nfamilies, their future addressed here. That's what the messag e of \\nthe election was.'' One of the first difficult questions now facing \\nCongress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face \\nof public resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican \\nmajority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes \\nrequired for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement \\nreleased Wednesday, Hyde said ``The Committee continues to have a \\nclear constituional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious \\nmanner. Our duty has not changed becasue the constitution has not \\nchanged.'' But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the election results \\nguaranteed that impeachment will fail. ``I think any serious effort \\nto remove President Clinton from office is effectively over,'' he \\nsaid. ``It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on \\nan exit strategy.'' From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, \\na Long Island Republican, said, ``The inquiry should be wrapped up \\nexpeditiously, fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate \\nfuture.'' For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control \\nof the House with a 228-207 majority and to find consensus among their \\nparty's competing factions. With their numbers reduced, the Republican \\nleadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite \\na hard-core conservative faction that wants a more aggressive social \\nagenda with a bloc of moderates who want their party to return to \\nthe center. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. \\nThe new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate \\nRepublicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, taking control away \\nfrom Republican leaders. Already seeing some of the possibilities, \\nRep. Peter King of Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans \\nwould be strengthened. ``It gives us much more leverage with the leadership \\nand makes it easier to protect New York,'' he said. ``It's going to \\nweaken the position of the strident conservatives and the anti-northeast \\nconservatives.'' Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election \\ngains ranging from 10 seats to more than 40. Seeming uncharacteristically \\nuncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting for the results. \\n``Things were happening out there that none of us fully understand--neither \\nparty in my judgment,'' he said. Taking his share of the blame for \\nhis party's losses, the Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how \\nthe public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplified in the \\nmodern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican \\nthemes. ``I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people \\nwould just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio \\nand then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of \\ndisgusting by sheer repetition,'' he said. ``And as a result I think \\nwe probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a \\nmuch stronger message about cutting taxes and saving Social Security, \\nwinning the war on drugs, reforming education and national defense.'' \\nMajority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted mistakes, \\nsaying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final \\n96 hours of the campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble \\nto pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. ``One of this lessons \\nfor Republicans out of this is that we need to listen more carefully \\nto the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise \\nmessage that we do apply across the nation,'' he said in Washington. \\nBoth Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis next \\nyear on tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system. Even \\nas the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers were \\nmaking phone calls trying to assess whether to mount challenges against \\nthe Republican leaders who have steered the Congress since the Republican's \\nassumed control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer said \\nthe House had become a ``tinderbox'' of intrigue. Scarborough said, \\n``The long distance charges in Washington offices probably are going \\nthrough the roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes \\nthat something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans \\nwhen Republican governors are doing so well in New York, Massachusetts, \\nFlorida and Texas.'' And while Gingrich has not gone out of his way \\nto identify himself with the Republican campaign's last-minute ad \\nblitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible. \\nGingrich has faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup attempt \\nagainst him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his own leadership \\nteam in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him remains a long-shot. \\nBut with House leadership elections now set for mid-November, Republicans \\nsaid this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus had crossed ideological \\nlines to moderates like Shays as well. ``We got shellacked,'' said \\nRep. Christopher Cannon, a conserative from Utah. ``We beat ourselves \\nbecause we had no agenda.'' Republicans were discussing possible challenges \\nto Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members \\nof the senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying to run \\nan entire new ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations \\nCommittee chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, \\nan Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election results \\ncould cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, ``I'm not particularly \\nconcerned.'' Republicans close to him said they expected the anger \\nto dissipate. In the Senate, where leadership races take place in \\nearly December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenges \\nagainst mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular \\npique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of \\nKentucky, who poured party dollars and much of his own time into trying \\nto defeat the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell \\nFeingold of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race. Some lawmakers \\non Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he \\nwould replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked to more than \\neight senators, and was considering whether to challenge McConnell. \\nHagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election outcome. \\n``This is a big loss for us,'' he said. ``We squandered a very historic \\nopportunity last night. To just break even is a loss.'' Most incumbents \\ncoasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. \\nFive House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, \\nBill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of \\nNew Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lost his \\nre-election bid _ Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House members \\ninclude 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat \\nwas leading Molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House \\nseat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement was not expected \\nuntil Friday after absentee ballots are counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed \\n``revolutionaries'' of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly \\nelected members are career politicians who rose through the ranks \\nof local and state government. Three of the Democrats are the sons \\nof former lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who \\nrepresented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall \\nbrother, Stewart, a former Congressman and Secretary of the Interior, \\nand Charlie Gonzalez, who o won the Texas seat of his father, Henry. \\n\\nStunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional \\nRepublicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for \\ntheir failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an \\noff-year election.

And while Gingrich has not gone out of his way \\nto identify himself with the Republican campaign's last-minute ad \\nblitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible. \\nGingrich has faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup attempt \\nagainst him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his own leadership \\nteam in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him remains a long-shot. \\nBut with House leadership elections now set for mid-November, Republicans \\nsaid this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus had crossed ideological \\nlines to moderates like Shays as well. ``We got shellacked,'' said \\nRep. Christopher Cannon, a conservative from Utah. ``We beat ourselves \\nbecause we had no agenda.'' Republicans were discussing possible challenges \\nto Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members \\nof the senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying to run \\nan entire new ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations \\nCommittee chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, \\nan Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election results \\ncould cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, ``I'm not particularly \\nconcerned.'' Republicans close to him said they expected the anger \\nto dissipate. In the Senate, where leadership races take place in \\nearly December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenges \\nagainst mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular \\npique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of \\nKentucky, who poured party dollars and much of his own time into trying \\nto defeat the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell \\nFeingold of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race. Some lawmakers \\non Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he \\nwould replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked to more than \\neight senators, and was considering whether to challenge McConnell. \\nHagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election outcome. \\n``This is a big loss for us,'' he said. ``We squandered a very historic \\nopportunity last night. To just break even is a loss.'' Most incumbents \\ncoasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. \\nFive House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, \\nBill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of \\nNew Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lost his \\nre-election bid _ Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House members \\ninclude 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat \\nwas leading Molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House \\nseat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement was not expected \\nuntil Friday after absentee ballots are counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed \\n``revolutionaries'' of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly \\nelected members are career politicians who rose through the ranks \\nof local and state government. Three of the Democrats are the sons \\nof former lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who \\nrepresented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall \\nbrother, Stewart, a former congressman and secretary of the Interior, \\nand Charlie Gonzalez, who won the Texas seat of his father, Henry. \\n\\nStunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional \\nRepublicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for \\ntheir failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an \\noff-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility \\nof congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results \\nshowed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold \\nover the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in the \\nHouse. The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that \\nthe president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and \\nit whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes. \\nThe Democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political \\nyear marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair \\nwith Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming \\na Democrat leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent, \\namounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican-controlled \\nCongress of 1953, the last time Republicans controlled the House until \\nthey captured it again in 1994. With attention now shifting to the \\nHouse Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry \\nHyde told fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday \\nthat the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be the \\nindependent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, told lawmakers \\nhe hoped to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment \\nby Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands \\nand put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday \\nuntil they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying to put \\nthe best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, \\nGa., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three elections \\nin a row for the first time since the election of 1932. But furious \\nrank and file Republicans burned up the phone lines to each other, \\ndiscussing whether to mount leadership challenges in both chambers \\nin the next few weeks. ``We've got to reach out and have more than \\nsouthern white males running the Washington Republican Party,'' said \\nRep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He said that Republicans \\nthis year had been left without any accomplishments to run on. ``We \\nneed an agenda first of all,'' he said. ``We went an entire calendar \\nyear without an agenda.'' Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut \\ncalled the election a devastating loss and said simply, ``There are \\ngoing to be major changes in our leadership. All segments of our party \\nwant to see change.'' At the White House, Clinton called the election \\nresults a vindication of his party's policies. ``If you look at all \\nthe results,'' he said, ``they are clear and unambiguous. The American \\npeople want their business, their concerns, their children, their \\nfamilies, their future addressed here. That's what the message of \\nthe election was.'' One of the first difficult questions now facing \\nCongress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face \\nof public resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican \\nmajority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes \\nrequired for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement \\nreleased Wednesday, Hyde said ``The Committee continues to have a \\nclear constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious \\nmanner. Our duty has not changed because the constitution has not \\nchanged.'' But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the election results \\nguaranteed that impeachment will fail. ``I think any serious effort \\nto remove President Clinton from office is effectively over,'' he \\nsaid. ``It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on \\nan exit strategy.'' From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, \\na Long Island Republican, said, ``The inquiry should be wrapped up \\nexpeditiously, fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate \\nfuture.'' For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control \\nof the House with 228 seats and to find consensus among their party's \\ncompeting factions. With their numbers reduced, the Republican leadership \\nwill need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core \\nconservative faction that wants a more aggressive social agenda with \\na bloc of moderates who want their party to return to the center. \\nThe Democrats held 206 seats, and one was held by an indepenndent. \\nAny small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The \\nnew arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate \\nRepublicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, taking control away \\nfrom Republican leaders. Already seeing some of the possibilities, \\nRep. Peter King of Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans \\nwould be strengthened. ``It gives us much more leverage with the leadership \\nand makes it easier to protect New York,'' he said. ``It's going to \\nweaken the position of the strident conservatives and the anti-northeast \\nconservatives.'' Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election \\ngains ranging from 10 seats to more than 40. Seeming uncharacteristically \\nuncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting for the results. \\n``Things were happening out there that none of us fully understand--neither \\nparty in my judgment,'' he said. Taking his share of the blame for \\nhis party's losses, the Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how \\nthe public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplified in the \\nmodern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican \\nthemes. ``I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people \\nwould just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio \\nand then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of \\ndisgusting by sheer repetition,'' he said. ``And as a result I think \\nwe probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a \\nmuch stronger message about cutting taxes and saving Social Security, \\nwinning the war on drugs, reforming education and national defense.'' \\nMajority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted mistakes, \\nsaying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final \\n96 hours of the campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble \\nto pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. ``One of this lessons \\nfor Republicans out of this is that we need to listen more carefully \\nto the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise \\nmessage that we do apply across the nation,'' he said in Washington. \\nBoth Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis next \\nyear on tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system. Even \\nas the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers were \\nmaking phone calls trying to assess whether to mount challenges against \\nthe Republican leaders who have steered the Congress since the Republican's \\nassumed control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer said \\nthe House had become a ``tinderbox'' of intrigue. Scarborough said, \\n``The long distance charges in Washington offices probably are going \\nthrough the roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes \\nthat something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans \\nwhen Republican governors are doing so well in New York, Massachusetts, \\nFlorida and Texas.'' And while Gingrich has not gone out of his way \\nto identify himself with the Republican campaign's last-minute ad \\nblitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible. \\nGingrich has faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup attempt \\nagainst him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his own leadership \\nteam in the summer of 1997.

Newt \\nGingrich as speaker and Gingrich fighting with a counter-campaign \\nthat has given some members pause about ousting him. At the same time, \\na small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not \\nvote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because \\nof the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in \\nknots for months because it could throw the speakership to a Democrat. \\nRep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally have made the decision \\nthat I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there \\nare six others who have told me they feel the same way, seven people \\nwho just will not, and it takes six to deadlock the vote.'' Fury at \\nthe speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections, when Republicans \\nsuffered a net loss of five seats in the House. They blamed Gingrich, \\nthe party's chief strategist. But many were already angry at him for \\nwhat they said was his failure to articulate a clear message for the \\nparty going into the elections and for a messy budget process that \\ngave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted Republican \\nprinciples of fiscal conservativism by containing massive amounts \\nof pork spending. House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by \\nsecret ballot for their leaders. Whoever wins the party's nomination \\nfor speaker then stands for election by the full House in January. \\nEven if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could be denied re-election \\nas speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to \\nvote for him. Because the Republicans now control the House by only \\n12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him \\na majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own \\nas speaker. With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, \\nLivingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of \\nthe party, according to Republican officials. The officials said that \\nLivingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the disastrous election \\nreturns but also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier \\ndispleasure with the speaker over the budget process. Several Republicans \\nsaid that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \\nand one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker, \\nand Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for \\nvotes. Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, \\nbut several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce \\nhis intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, after he had determined \\nif he could win. ``He won't do it 'til he has his ducks in a row, \\nand right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker,'' said \\nan aide to a Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle \\nthe line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement \\nto a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party. \\n\\nThe presidential campaign of 2000 began Wednesday, like it or not. \\nThe millennial election will be fought on a political playing field \\nwhose rough outlines, if not its exact boundaries, were drawn by the \\nvoters in Tuesday's elections, which delivered a crushing disappointment \\nto the giddy hopes of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to \\nthe recently ailing Democrats. President Clinton called it an ``astonishing'' \\ntriumph of issues over investigations and said the Democrats had won \\nso many major victories ``because they had a clear message.'' Republicans \\nagreed. Of course the next 18 months will bring many surprises and \\nmany reversals of fortune. But the election results offered important \\nguidelines. Tuesday was a great day for Vice President Al Gore, for \\nat least three reasons. He worked furiously and successfully in the \\nlast ten days before the balloting to persuade Democratic loyalists \\nnot to stay home and sulk, appearing on behalf of no fewer than 224 \\ncandidates, according to his office. A moderate within the spectrum \\nof his own party, he watched moderates win crucial elections, notably \\nin the California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a \\ncautious pragmatist like Gore, won a smashing victory. The returns \\n_ an even break in the Senate and a Democratic gain of five in the \\nHouse of Representatives _ also made the impeachment of President \\nClinton less likely. And the better shape Clinton is in as his term \\nends, the better chance Gore, his sidekick for six years now, stands \\nin the presidential nomination process and, ultimately, the election. \\nBut California voters also complicated the nominating process and \\nset Gore strategists to work on tactics to uncomplicate it, because \\nhe and they consider the state absolutely central to his presidential \\naspirations. In a referendum in 1996, California adopted a primary \\nsystem under which Republicans, Democrats and independent voters would \\nall receive the same ballot, with candidates of all parties listed. \\nThat violates the rules of both major parties, and a measure on the \\nballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would have rescinded the 1996 change. \\nBut it failed, raising the possibility that California's March 7 primary \\nwill be a mere political popularity poll, with convention delegates \\nchosen in caucus or convention _ a nightmare. Tuesday was a bad day \\nfor the Republican right. High-profile right-wingers lost across the \\ncountry, from Attorney General Dan Lungren in the California governor's \\nrace to Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election in North Carolina, \\nto Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, who failed in a Senate race despite \\na huge spending advantage over Sen. Russell Feingold, to Ellen Sauerbrey \\nin Maryland, who proved unable on her second try to prevail over an \\nunpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservatives \\nand moderates in the party said the Republicans had to get back to \\nbasics. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded that the results ``should \\nsober every Republican'' and called for new strategic thinking. ``If \\nyou make it a referendum on a president with a 67 per cent approval \\nrating, as they tried to do, you shouldn't be surprised if the election \\ngoes against you,'' said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a moderate \\nwhose promoters mention him weekly as a possible vice-presidential \\nnominee. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a conservative who tends to \\nsteer away from divisive social issues, won re-election with 68 per \\ncent of the vote. He is studying the possibility of a presidential \\nrace, but before he or any other Republican nominee can hope to win, \\nhe said in an interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their \\nleaders need to learn some lessons. ``I just hope this debacle is \\na wake-up call for our people,'' he said. ``You've got to be for something \\n_ smaller government, better education, something. We're seen as the \\nparty that's against everything.'' Polls taken late in this year's \\ncampaign bore McCain out. They showed that the Republicans are no \\nlonger identified with issues that were once their electoral bread \\nand butter, such as low taxes and law and order. Tuesday was also \\na fresh demonstration, for anyone who needed one, of the political \\nutility of pitching a tent big enough for almost everyone. Black politicians \\nin North Carolina, Maryland and California reported that their fears \\nof an indifferent black turnout had proved groundless. Black votes \\nproved indispensable to a considerable number of hard-pressed Democratic \\ncandidates, especially where they felt their interests directly threatened. \\nThe figures on Hispanic voting, assembled from exit polls and from \\nthe candidates' own precinct analyses, showed dramatic differences. \\nIn California, where the outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, \\nhad played the anti-immigration card with a vengeance, both major \\nDemocratic candidates _ Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who won re-election \\nafter trailing in early polls _ cleaned up among Hispanic voters. \\nHe took 78 percent, she 72. But both of the Bush brothers, Jeb in \\nFlorida and George W. in Texas, took more than half the Hispanic vote \\nin their highly successful gubernatorial campaigns. So did McCain. \\nJeb Bush is married to a Hispanic woman, he and his brother both speak \\nSpanish fluently and frequently, and Senator McCain has long espoused \\nHispanic causes. Both George W. Bush and McCain will draw strength, \\nif they decide to run, from their proven ability to appeal to Hispanic \\nvoters, as well as their general electoral strength. George W. Bush \\ntook 69 percent of the vote in Texas, where a Democrat sat in the \\ngovernor's chair only four years ago, and which has the second-largest \\nbloc of electoral votes. Florida has the fourth-largest. Governor \\nBush of Texas uttered a rallying cry for the moderates. ``A leader \\nwho is compassionate and conservative,'' he said in his victory speech, \\n``can erase the gender gap and open the Republican party to new faces \\nand new voices.'' But figures on the right saw things differently. \\nJames Dobson, a leading religious broadcaster, said that Republicans \\nhad fared poorly because Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, \\nthe majority leader, had caved in to the president on the budget and \\nde-emphasized social issues such as abortion and flag desecration. \\nHe called all but explicitly for the ouster of Gingrich. Likewise, \\nthe millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate \\nin 2000, said the leadership ``will have a lot to answer for.'' Tuesday \\nproved the potency of education as an issue, and suggested that it \\nwill emerge as a major theme of the 2000 campaign. Clinton, in his \\nlimited involvement in the campaign, and Gore, in his extensive participation, \\nboth stressed Democratic programs to build more schools and hire more \\nteachers. Almost a quarter of California voters _ and there are now \\nalmost twice as many voters in California as in any other state _ \\nnamed education as their most pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats \\nwon the governorships of Alabama and South Carolina against the odds, \\npartly by emphasizing their rivals' opposition to lotteries that will \\nhelp to pay for schools. In Iowa, a Democrat was elected governor \\nfor the first time since 1969 on a platform that featured the dilapidated \\ncondition of the state's schools and a promise to remedy it. Tuesday \\ndemonstrated the overriding importance of money in modern American \\npolitics. Feingold, one of the principal backers of campaign-finance \\nreform, survived to fight another day, but so did opponents of reform. \\nAnd the returns in House races, showing that all but six of 401 members \\nwho sought re-election had won, underlined once again how hard it \\nis, under the present system, for a challenger to raise enough money \\nto compete effectively. The difficulties of raising money may doom \\nmany would-be presidential candidacies. Gore will have what he needs, \\nas will Bush, Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. \\nBut how many others will? Finally, Tuesday delivered an indecisive \\nmessage about impeachment. Close to two-thirds of voters nationwide \\ntold exit pollsters that they intended to send no message about Clinton, \\nbut they made it clear in response to other questions that they disliked \\nthe House inquiry into the president's alleged misdeeds and wanted \\nto see it end. In only two states, Kansas and Nebraska, did a majority \\nof voters say they favored even a congressional censure of Clinton, \\na much milder form of punishment advocated by many Clinton backers. \\nSome Republicans said privately that there should be no hearings at \\nall in the Clinton matter, and some Democrats began talking about \\na deal, the equivalent of a plea bargain that would bring the matter \\nto an early close. Nevertheless, Republican members of the House Judiciary \\nCommittee said they needed to press ahead with the Constitutional \\nprocess that the House has set in motion. Among those taking that \\nview were Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, a fierce foe of the president, \\nand Rep. Mary Bono of California, whose tone has been more muted. \\nBut Rep. David Dreier of California, the incoming Rules Committee \\nchairman, said that ``the election has played a role in ensuring that \\none of us has a desire to drag that out.'' \\n\\nA struggle for control of the House is under way, with Rep. Robert \\nLivingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him \\nrunning against Newt Gingrich as speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign \\nhas given some members pause about ousting him. At the same time, \\na small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not \\nvote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because \\nof the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in \\nknots for months. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally \\nhave made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker \\nin January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the \\nsame way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to deadlock \\nthe vote.'' Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections, \\nwhen Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House. They \\nblamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many were already \\nangry at him for what they said was his failure to articulate a clear \\nmessage for the party going into the elections and for a messy budget \\nprocess that gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted \\nRepublican principles of fiscal conservativism by containing massive \\namounts of spending for local projects. House Republicans are to meet \\nNov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders. Whoever wins the \\nRepublican nomination for speaker must stand for election by the full \\nHouse in January. Even if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could \\nbe denied re-election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least \\nfive others refuse to vote for him. Because the Republicans now control \\nthe House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich \\nto deny him a majority. With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect \\nlooming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the \\ngood of the party, Republican officials said. The officials said that \\nLivingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the election returns but \\nalso before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure \\nwith the speaker over the budget process. Several Republicans said \\nthat both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \\nand one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker, \\nand Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for \\nvotes. Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, \\nbut several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce \\nhis intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, only after he had determined \\nif he could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., was one of several members \\nwho spoke with Livingston on Thursday. ``He told me he's making a \\nnumber of phone calls, that he's gotten a very positive response about \\nrunning for speaker, and he'll decide within the next 48 hours,'' \\nKing said. ``He won't do it till he has his ducks in a row, and right \\nnow a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker,'' said an aide \\nto a Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line \\nbetween fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement \\nto a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party. Many Republicans \\nimmediately blamed Gingrich for the party's losses on Tuesday. Talk \\nquickly emerged the next day of a slate of candidates to oppose Gingrich \\nand his lieutenants. The list of possible candidates for leadership \\npositions included Rep.e Steve Largent of Oklahoma, who talked with \\nLivingston on Thursday about challenging Gingrich, Republican officials \\nsaid, speaking on the condition that their names not be reported. \\nThose officials said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted to \\nrun with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, \\nthe majority leader. But, these officials said that if Livingston \\ndid not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for speaker instead. \\nOther names were floated Wednesday for leadership posts. They included \\nReps. David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer Dunn of Washington \\nas conference chairman. Added to the mix on Thursday was the name \\nof Rep. Christopher Cox, a California conservative. As a sign of the \\nuncertainty prevailing among House members on Thursday, Rep. Henry \\nHyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the House's \\nmost venerable members, rebuffed a chance to endorse Gingrich as speaker. \\nHyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party's losses \\nTuesday. ``Leadership takes credit when things go right,'' he said. \\n``They ought to take the blame when things go wrong.'' Asked if Gingrich \\nshould remain speaker, Hyde said: ``I rather think he will, but that \\nremains to be seen.'' The energy that many vented publicly on Wednesday \\nas anger toward Gingrich seemed devoted on Thursday to intense internal \\npolitical calculations about whether Livingston could succeed in toppling \\nGingrich and whether he should succeed. While many support him as \\na veteran who understands the House and has shown shrewd political \\nskills in managing the massive federal budget, others are reviving \\nimages of the Louisianan as a hot-head who gave the party a bad name \\nduring the government shutdown two years ago and who tends toward \\narm-flailing in heated moments. One conservative leader said that \\nhe and his allies had reservations about Livingston because he was \\n``obsessed'' about trying to keep social issues out of the budget \\nprocess. The budget, he said, ``has been a vehicle for conservatives \\nover the years to add restrictions on federal money for abortion and \\nother things you can't get through the Senate or past a presidential \\nveto. If Livingston is the challenger, I doubt that will cause a rallying \\nof the real conservatives in Congress.'' Some moderates said they \\nwere prepared to support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, ``I \\nwould be amenable to Livingston.'' Still, she cautioned, ``I'm not \\nafter Newt. But it's wrong not to sit down and seriously look at our \\noptions.'' Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., \\nsaid that his boss was ``emblematic'' of the confusion among the broad \\nbase of House Republicans. ``Billy has been loyal to both Speaker \\nGingrich and Dick Armey, and he's still loyal to them, but he also \\nwants to hear what they have to say before committing to them in the \\nnext election,'' Johnson said. ``Everyone is asking the same question: \\nCan we refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning \\nthe leadership?'' Salmon said his refusal to support Gingrich no matter \\nwhat was based on Gingrich's track record of ``one failed strategy \\nafter another,'' including the impeachment process and the pork-laden \\nbudget. With the challenge under way, Gingrich has been trying to \\nshow members that he is responsive to their concerns. After an election \\nnight in which he portrayed the Republicans as victorious even as \\nthey lost seats, the next day he took ``responsibility'' for the losses. \\nIn another move, Gingrich has indicated that he is willing to cede \\ncontrol over the party's congressional campaign committee, allowing \\nthe whole House to select its members. Gingrich is also making strong \\npersonal appeals to Republicans. Said one top House aide: ``He'll \\nget support. How much? Only his own vote-counters know.'' \\n\", \"\\nAriel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves \\nas ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official \\nSyrian newspaper said Saturday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \\nnamed Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner \\nin charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. \\nMany Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. \\nAn Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly \\nresponsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by \\nChristian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps. ``Sharon's appointment \\nas foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which \\nhas stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often speaks for \\nthe Syrian government. Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off more than \\ntwo years ago. Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached \\nan informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, \\nwhich Israel captured from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's government \\nrejected that agreement, saying it was never completed. Netanyahu \\nhas sent ``a clear message to all those who are deluding themselves \\n_ and betting on Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand _ to give \\nup their illusions,'' the paper said. \\n\\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish \\nformer defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday \\nin an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning \\nover more West Bank land to the Palestinians. With his appointment, \\nSharon, 70, an ardent advocate for Jewish settlements in the West \\nBank, is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concessions \\nthat Netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference \\nin the Washington area next week. For months, Sharon, who is currently \\nthe minister of national infrastructures, has maintained that redeploying \\nIsraeli troops from more than an additional 9 percent of the West \\nBank would be a ``national disaster.'' In assuming the role of foreign \\nminister, however, he would be forced to abandon his public opposition \\nto Netanyahu's decision to withdraw from another 13 percent of the \\nPalestinian territory _ even if he votes against the accord. Sharon \\nwill be drawn directly into the issue, since Netanyahu has appointed \\nhim to direct the final status talks with the Palestinians, which \\nwould follow the signing of an interim peace agreement. Last week \\nSharon told an Israeli newspaper that, negotiations or not, he would \\nnever shake the hand of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, whom \\nhe has long disdained. Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists were \\ndivided in their reactions, in similar ways. Some professed to be \\naghast, and some, like Nabil Sha'ath, the Palestinian transportation \\nminister, said they were willing to ``forget history'' if Sharon's \\nappointment provided Netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal. \\nIn Washington, White House and State Department officials pledged \\nto work closely with Sharon and emphasized that the personnel in an \\nIsraeli government are an internal affair. ``Arik Sharon is the most \\nfitting person in the state of Israel for the position of foreign \\nminister,'' Netanyahu said, using his nickname. ``He brings with him \\nrich experience, creativity, proven working ability and I think that \\nhe well knows both the wounds and damages of war as well as the fruits \\nof peace. ``Sharon has never hidden his beliefs,'' he continued, ``and \\nhis words have influenced the way that the redeployment will be carried \\nout if not its extent.'' In a nod to Sharon, Netanyahu has decided \\non a new location for the nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent \\nof the West Bank land. It was supposed to be in the Judean desert \\nnear Israel's eastern border, which Sharon argued would pose a strategic \\nsecurity risk. Instead, it was decided on Thursday that the nature \\nreserve would instead be on the slopes of the Hebron hills, much closer \\nto existing Jewish settlements. Many Israeli political observers believe \\nthat Netanyahu has eviscerated his right-wing opposition with this \\nappointment, signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace \\nagreement. ``Who is the right wing now if Sharon is in the foreign \\nministry and negotiating with the Palestinians?'' asked Uzi Benziman, \\nan editorial board member of the newspaper Haaretz and author of a \\ncritical biography of Sharon. ``It will be just the settlers and some \\nreal hard-liners who don't comprise more than 15 percent of public \\nopinion. So it's really quite an intelligent move, suggesting that \\nNetanyahu means business in trying to get an agreement.'' But the \\nPalestinians took the news hard, and read it differently. ``I think \\nit's a clear-cut message from Bibi,'' Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator \\nfor the Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. ``I imagine \\npeople will try to explain Netanyahu's intentions as trying to get \\nthe support of the right. What he is trying to do is make peace with \\nthe right wing at the expense of making peace with us. It means he \\nwants to continue on the path of non-negotiations, because he wants \\nto continue to be prime minister at any cost.'' Sharon declined to \\nbe interviewed Friday because his appointment must still be approved \\nby the Cabinet on Tuesday, an approval that is expected. An aide, \\nRaanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted the position so that he could ``stem \\nthe tide of dangerous developments and contribute to fighting the \\nrisks facing Israel.'' A retired general who fought in every Israeli \\nwar, Sharon, 70, is a leading figure of the Likud Party who has done \\nmuch battle with the Likud prime minister. At the most recent party \\nconvention, he said that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand from \\nhis left, which the prime minister dismissed Friday as a comment made \\n``in the height of political arguments.'' And when Netanyahu first \\nformed his Cabinet in 1996, the fact that he did not give Sharon a \\nsenior position caused an 11th-hour crisis before the swearing-in \\nceremony. Sharon retreated to his family farm in the Negev, and David \\nLevy, who had been named foreign minister, said he would not serve \\nunless Sharon was given a post. Netanyahu then created a Cabinet job, \\nthe minister of infrastructures, especially for Sharon. Levy resigned \\nin January after a lengthy power struggle with the prime minister, \\nand since then Netanyahu has been serving as his own foreign minister. \\nSharon, a member of the old guard, has a complicated political past, \\nhighlighted by a string of military victories, and checkered, to many, \\nby his indirect role, as defense minister, in the Lebanese Christian \\nPhalangist massacre of unarmed civilians in the Sabra and Shatila \\nrefugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. Many Israelis, even those who despise \\nhis politics, see him as a strong, experienced figure who knows his \\nmind and who is capable of being moderate when he has power. Friday \\nafternoon, the right-wing political establishment nearly universally \\napplauded the appointment. Uzi Landau, who is a Likud hard-liner, \\nsaid he was relieved to hear confirmed what has been a rumor for weeks. \\n``I feel more safe about the negotiations if Minister Sharon is directly \\ninvolved,'' said Landau, who heads the Parliament's security and foreign \\naffairs committee. ``Undoubtedly it will facilitate the situation \\nfor the prime minister to show the right that Arik Sharon is identified \\nwith the program, so therefore they can live with it.'' Right before \\nthe announcement was made, leaders of the National Religious Party, \\nwho had threatened to bring down the government, changed their combative \\ntone. They emerged mollified from meetings with Netanyahu late Thursday, \\nsaying they would leave the government intact. Still, they would not \\nconnect their change of heart to the nomination of Sharon. ``Appointing \\nSharon is a political step we like very much,'' said Shaul Yahalom, \\nthe minister of transportation and a leader of the National Religious \\nParty. ``But it will have no effect on how we see the peace agreement. \\nOur concern there is on whether any of the 160 Jewish settlements \\nare endangered.'' The appointment of Sharon comes against a backdrop \\nof violence that has erupted this week. Friday, a 19-year-old Israeli \\nsoldier, Michal Adato, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian man as \\nshe got off a bus in her hometown, the settlement of Tomer in the \\nJordan Valley. Netanyahu reported that he had received a sympathy \\nnote from Arafat, who condemned the attack. Also Friday, in the continuing \\nclashes between Palestinian youths and soldiers in the divided city \\nof Hebron, 32 Palestinians were lightly injured by rubber bullets \\nafter the funeral of a Palestinian protester shot dead on Thursday. \\nAfter Netanyahu made the announcement Friday, an Israeli reporter \\nintroduced a question by stating that Netanyahu had diminished the \\npolitical threat from the right wing by appointing Sharon. ``Are you \\nwilling to sign on that?'' Netanyahu said. ``I do not know that. I \\ndo know one thing that when you are dependent on the vote of one or \\ntwo people you can never know what will be.'' He was referring to \\nhis razor-thin majority in parliament _ which some analysts perceive \\nto be his key motivator in appointing Sharon. ``More than anything \\nelse, this reflects the political weakness of Netanyahu,'' said Yaron \\nEzrahi, a leading intellectual and critic of the prime minister. ``He \\nhas recognized that the next redeployment is inevitable if he doesn't \\nwant to be seen as contributing to the wave of political violence \\nthat would follow a failure. But he doesn't have the domestic political \\npower to carry out the big decision on his own.'' \\n\\nAriel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be Israel's next \\nforeign minister, said in an interview published Sunday that if he \\ngets the job, he won't shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser \\nArafat. Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians, \\nis being considered for the government's No. 2 post. In it, he would \\nbe a pivotal figure in reaching a final peace settlement with the \\nPalestinians. ``Even if I will be appointed foreign minister and run \\nthe negotiations, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand,'' Sharon was \\nquoted as saying in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper said Prime \\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu is close to making a decision on the appointment. \\nNetanyahu himself has been acting foreign minister since the post \\nwas vacated in January by David Levy, a moderate who opposed Netanyahu's \\nhardline negotiating strategy with the Palestinians. Sharon's appointment \\nwould signal a toughening of Israel's positions and could further \\nstrain relations with Arab neighbors. Sharon is the general who led \\nIsrael's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and a former housing minister who \\nstrengthened Jewish settlement in territories Israel captured from \\nSyria, Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war. Sharon told the Haaretz \\nnewspaper he would accept the foreign minister's job if he were allowed \\nto ``act to strengthen the country.'' \\n\\nThe New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: Just \\ndays before heading to the United States for critical negotiations \\nwith Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted \\nthe Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon \\nas Israeli foreign minister. The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, \\nlong an implacable foe of the Palestinians, is prepared to make peace \\nwith them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed. Unfortunately, \\nhe is also capable of wrecking the entire peace effort. Much will \\ndepend on whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, a \\ngoal that has eluded other Israeli leaders. Like a political typhoon, \\nSharon has roared across Israeli life for better than three decades \\nas a brilliant military commander, a reckless defense minister and \\nan ardent conservative, often leaving destruction in his wake. He \\nstill bears the burden of his role in the massacre of hundreds of \\nPalestinians by Christian militiamen in Lebanon in 1982. An Israeli \\ninquiry found he was indirectly responsible for the killings at the \\nSabra and Shatila refugee camps. As a leader of the most conservative \\nwing of the Likud party, Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his \\nshaky Cabinet during potentially decisive negotiations with Yasser \\nArafat, the Palestinian leader. That will be fine if Sharon is willing \\nto play a constructive role in the peace talks himself. But such behavior \\nis not likely to be the first impulse of a man who has famously said \\nhe would never shake hands with Arafat. Since Netanyahu has designated \\nSharon as his chief negotiator, the new foreign minister will soon \\nhave the opportunity to act more responsibly. The first order of business \\nwhen the two sides get together next week outside Washington is to \\nwrap up negotiations over the further withdrawal of Israeli forces \\nfrom the West Bank coupled with security guarantees from the Palestinians. \\nSharon can show statesmanship by helping Netanyahu close this deal, \\neven though it is opposed by the Israeli settlers whose cause Sharon \\nhas long championed. Success in these talks would clear the way for \\nthe last and most difficult negotiations about a permanent settlement, \\nincluding the shape and status of a Palestinian state and the future \\nof Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hopes to overcome the shame of Sabra \\nand Shatila, he must become a force for peace in the Middle East. \\n\\nAriel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves \\nas ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official \\nSyrian newspaper said Saturday.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat \\nmet Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman Monday to brief him on talks \\nwith U.S. officials on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations with \\nIsrael. Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the \\nnaming of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's \\nforeign minister. Sharon, whose appointment last week was widely seen \\nas a bid to keep far-right allies from toppling Netanyahu's government, \\nhas been quoted as saying he would refuse to shake the hand of Palestinian \\nleader Yasser Arafat. ``It's worrisome,'' Erekat said. Previously, \\nthe Palestinian leadership had said the appointment was an internal \\nIsraeli affair. Monday was a Jewish holiday and there was no immediate \\nIsraeli comment on summit prospects. However, the Israeli newspaper \\nYediot Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, \\ndue to meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to an American-authored \\nplan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank. Erekat said the Palestinians \\nhope the four-day summit, set to begin Thursday outside the U.S. capital, \\nwould mark the end of a long round of meetings and the start of implementation \\nof accords. ``It depends on Mr. Netanyahu. If he says `yes' to the \\nAmerican initiative and stops attempts to change the references of \\nthe interim agreement, we will reach an agreement in no time,'' Erekat \\nsaid. At the table is a U.S plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from \\n13 percent from the West Bank. The Palestinians accepted the plan, \\nwhich includes security conditions they must fulfill. \\n\\nBrief biography of Ariel Sharon, named Israel's foreign minister: \\n___ 1928: Born in Kfar Mallal in British-ruled Palestine. 1948 Mideast \\nwar: Fights as junior officer, wounded three times. 1953: Forms elite \\ncommando unit ``101'' and leads it on raids against Palestinian guerrillas \\nwho had been attacking Israeli border villages. 1956 Sinai campaign: \\nCommands a parachute brigade that is dropped behind enemy lines, captures \\na key pass and cuts off Egyptian army's retreat. 1967 Mideast war: \\nCommands an armored division that breaks through into central Sinai \\nPeninsula. 1973 Mideast war: Commands a division that crosses the \\nSuez Canal, turning the tide of the war on the Egyptian front. 1977: \\nElected to parliament and appointed minister of agriculture in the \\ngovernment of Menachem Begin. 1981: Defense minister in Begin government. \\n1982-83: Invades Lebanon in June 1982 to drive out PLO guerrillas, \\nbut is held indirectly responsible for Lebanese Christian militiamen's \\nSeptember 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the \\nSabra and Shatilla refugee camps south of Beirut. As a result, Sharon \\nresigns as defense minister and holds only second-rank posts for next \\n15 years. 1984-90: Serves as trade minister in national unity government \\nheaded by Yitzhak Shamir of Likud and Shimon Peres of Labor. 1990-92: \\nServes as housing minister, presiding over settlement drive in the \\nWest Bank and Gaza Strip. 1996: Named infrastructure minister in Netanyahu \\ngovernment. Oct. 9, 1998: Netanyahu appoints him foreign minister, \\nplaces him in charge of negotiations with the Palestinians, marking \\nhis return to the center of Israeli politics and world political arena. \\n\\nAriel Sharon has a law degree, and fancies himself a farmer. But for \\nmore than three decades his role in Israeli public life has been that \\nof an unapologetic warrior, first on the battlefield and later in \\nthe bare-knuckled combat of domestic partisan politics. With his blunt \\ntongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon at 70 is \\nto his many critics here a caricature of right-wing intransigence. \\nTo his equally numerous admirers he is a living symbol of unrelenting \\ndedication to Israel's national survival. Still conveying physical \\nvigor within an impressively expanding frame, he remains pugnacious \\nto a fault. Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign \\nminister is not a natural diplomat. A Zionist underground operative \\nas a teen-ager and an infantry commander wounded in the 1948 war of \\nindependence, Sharon has fought, and fought memorably, in virtually \\nevery major military engagement in his country's history. He commanded \\nthe legendary armored division that crossed and seized control of \\nthe Sinai in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He returned to active service \\nafter a three-month retirement to lead Israel's badly outgunned armored \\ndivisions to victory, again in the Sinai, in the war of 1973. As defense \\nminister in 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion of Lebanon, defying \\ninternational condemnation with unrelenting artillery assaults on \\nBeirut neighborhoods and Palestinian refugee camps believed by the \\nIsraeli high command to be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts. \\nTo some, both in Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion will \\nforever be associated with the massacres by Lebanese Christian Phalangists, \\nallies of the Israelis, of a reported 460 unarmed Palestinians in \\nthe Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. In an official inquiry in Jerusalem \\nand in a subsequent libel trial he brought in New York, Sharon was \\nseen to have effectively refuted charges that he knew of and condoned \\nthe Phalangists' attacks beforehand. But the government investigating \\ncommission held that his failure to prevent the killings constituted \\ngrounds for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry. Since the 1982 \\ninvasion, Israel has been mired in an unpopular open-ended occupation \\nof southern Lebanon, an operation with constant casualties among young \\ninductees for which Sharon is still often blamed. To many Israelis, \\nhowever, the Lebanese incursion was ultimately a risk worth taking, \\nas it succeeded in crushing the PLO militarily and driving its forces \\nfar from Israel's borders. The PLO's defeat at Sharon's hands in Lebanon \\nled eventually to its renunciation of armed warfare against Israel \\nand embrace of the peace negotiation process for which Sharon as Foreign \\nMinister will now be responsible. In civilian life he proved as savvy \\na political operator as he was a military strategist, helping to break \\nLabor's hold on the Knesset and making himself an indispensable binding \\nforce within successive fractious Likud coalitions. His investiture \\nas foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment \\nin 21 years. He previously held the agriculture and defense portfolios \\nunder Prime Minister Menachem Begin, trade and housing in Yitzhak \\nShamir's government, and national infrastructure _ essentially, a \\nsettlements support directorate _ in the administration of Benjamin \\nNetanyahu. As a key member of the ``inner cabinet'' in Begin's first \\ngovernment, Sharon began the construction and systematic expansion \\nof new Israeli housing developments throughout the West Bank, Gaza \\nStrip and Galilee area territories occupied by Israel since 1967, \\na policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remains his signal \\ndomestic political achievement. At 70, Sharon remains one of the great \\npolarizing fixtures of Israeli political life. An acerbic critic of \\nthe other leading soldier-politician of his generation, Yitzhak Rabin, \\nSharon attacked the Oslo peace accords as ``terrible and dangerous'' \\nand condemned Rabin's negotiating partner, Yasser Arafat, as a ``war \\ncriminal.'' He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussions of the return \\nof even an internationally demilitarized Golan Heights to Syria. A \\nsecular Jew in the manner typical of his generation of native-born \\nIsraelis, Sharon became an outspoken and effective defender of new \\nOrthodox Jewish settlements in the predominantly Palestinian areas \\nof the West Bank, cementing his position as a bridge between the traditional \\nsecular right and the new militant religious factions within the Likud \\ncoalition. \\n\", \"\\nIt was a surprising scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera, one \\nof New York City's most left-leaning labor leaders, was singing the \\npraises of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president of the largest \\nunion in New York City, praised D'Amato for persuading Trent Lott, \\nthe Senate majority leader, to support legislation that financed health \\ncoverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children. It looked \\nas if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato _ or \\nat the very minimum stay neutral in this year's U.S. Senate race in \\nNew York. But on Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, the \\nNational Health and Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles \\nE. Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement \\nis risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because angering this powerful \\nsenator could make him far less responsive to labor's needs when unions \\nturn to him for help in the future if he is re-elected. Although it \\nmay seem illogical, two words go far to explain why Rivera's union \\nbacked Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely as a result of the Lewinsky \\nscandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that the Republicans will \\ngain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate, where the \\nRepublicans have 55 seats to the Democrats' 45. For labor leaders \\nlike Rivera, the notion of a strong Republican majority is a nightmare. \\nThat fear has helped push other New York unions into Schumer's column, \\neven though D'Amato had long courted them. Those unions include the \\nteamsters' joint council in New York City and District Council 37, \\nan umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees. Labor \\nleaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority, \\nthe Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently \\ndefeated Republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and \\ncut financing for the National Labor Relations Board. ``We are worried \\nabout legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive \\ninto the next century,'' Rivera said. Alarmed that the Democrats will \\nlose Senate seats in California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South \\nCarolina, Rivera's union concluded that it was worth backing Schumer. \\nThe decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, was not personal but was \\nbased on national considerations. ``Unfortunately, the leadership \\nof the Republican Party at the national level in the person of Newt \\nGingrich and Trent Lott are not necessarily from the same culture \\nas the Republicans of the Northeast,'' he said. ``They're far more \\nconservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more \\npro-business. We fear that the Democratic Party faces irrelevance \\nin the United States Senate if we go below 41 seats.'' Trying to avoid \\na rupture with D'Amato, Rivera praised him as ``an effective senator.'' \\nThe endorsement could be a boon for Schumer. Rivera's union and the \\nteachers' union have labor's strongest political operations in New \\nYork. In addition, Schumer will get thousands of dollars from the \\nlocal as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 \\npolitical calls a day. A spokesman for D'Amato said, ``Al D'Amato's \\nproud that he's been endorsed by over 100 union federations and locals, \\nrepresenting more that 400,000 working men and women, and he'll continue \\nhis efforts on behalf of working middle class families.'' His labor \\nendorsements include the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association \\nand the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. Besides \\nthe backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's \\nparent union, the Service Employees International Union, which has \\n350,000 members in New York State. Rivera _ who did not support D'Amato \\nthe last time he ran either _ announced the endorsements during the \\nfounding convention of the New York State Council of the service employees \\nunion. The convention packed Town Hall, and the new group aims to \\nmake the service employees a power to be reckoned with by bringing \\ntogether a dozen union locals to forge a common political and legislative \\nstrategy. Earlier this year, 1199 merged with the service employees, \\nand as part of that agreement, Rivera became head of the service employees \\nin New York State. \\n\\nWhite House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's \\nlargest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse \\nSen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group \\nto try to shift its support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles \\nSchumer. Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights \\nCampaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the \\nclosely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation. \\nThey said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday. But privately, \\norganization officials and gay activists from both parties who have \\nbeen monitoring the debate say the group is most likely to endorse \\nD'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term. They also raised the \\npossibility that the group would endorse both candidates, or remain \\nneutral. If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on \\nthe condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three \\nmajor factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been searching \\nfor allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's \\nrecent record on gay issues to be quite strong. An endorsement by \\nthe group, which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voters, \\ncould prove important in swinging voters to D'Amato in a tight race. \\nIt would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator, who has \\nsought to recast himself as a centrist in recent years and could use \\nthe endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voters. \\nA D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts to portray \\nthe incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify to many \\nvoters a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition that has \\nincluded black and gay voters, women and labor unions. The intensity \\nof the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance \\nof the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see \\ndefeating D'Amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the \\nRepublicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate _ enough to stop a \\nDemocratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority. \\n``There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get \\n60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically \\nfor the next two years,'' said David Mixner, a close friend of President \\nClinton's who is gay. He was referring to the Senate majority leader, \\nwho has called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania. \\nSaturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's largest \\ngay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda. \\nAlthough the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been very \\nclose to the Clinton administration, has many Democrats on its board \\nand receives much of its money from Democratic contributors. Largely \\nbecause of the group's strong Democratic ties, gay Democrats, New \\nYork liberals and White House officials are infuriated that it is \\neven considering endorsing D'Amato, who also runs on the Right to \\nLife and Conservative Party lines and often receives high ratings \\nfrom the Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation \\non civil rights for gay people. Although the organization has been \\nthought to be inching toward a D'Amato endorsement for months, the \\nlobbying campaign for Schumer has picked up intensity in the last \\ntwo weeks, driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer \\nthan ever. Democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights \\nfor gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton \\nand Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made \\npersonal appeals to Human Rights Campaign officials urging them not \\nto endorse D'Amato. White House officials said they did not know whether \\nthe three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials \\ndeclined to comment. Schumer met privately with the group's top officials \\nlast week to make one last pitch for the endorsement. Clinton administration \\nofficials have also been buttonholing the group's board members at \\nevery opportunity, from cocktail parties to fund-raisers, raising \\nconcerns about a D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocates of civil \\nrights for gay people have flooded the organization with phone calls, \\ne-mail messages and letters. Democratic officials have been encouraging \\nthe group's major donors to express their opposition to D'Amato. People \\ninvolved in the lobbying efforts said that at best, they are hoping \\nthe group will endorse both candidates, or make no endorsement at \\nall. ``Chuck Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are \\nimportant to gay communities,'' said a senior White House official \\nwho spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``The last thing that they \\nshould want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so \\nsupportive of their agenda.'' The Human Rights Campaign is considered \\nthe most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with \\na national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than \\n$13 million. The group was created in the early 1980s in large part \\nto counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, \\nD'Amato was first elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remained \\na strong supporter of President Reagan. For D'Amato, who has aggressively \\ncourted gay voters, the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement \\nin his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate. Since 1993, the \\nsenator has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military, \\nsponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers \\nand opposed his own leadership's attempts to block the nominations \\nof two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration. \\nTo gay supporters of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign \\nwould signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help \\nthe organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close \\nto the Democratic Party. Those who support a D'Amato endorsement, \\nincluding top officials within the Human Rights Campaign, contend \\nthat in the current political climate, where Congress is almost certain \\nto remain under Republican control after November, gay people must \\nbuild alliances with moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign officials \\nalso say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents, \\neven when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues. \\nThat is the case in New York, where Schumer's rating by the Human \\nRights Campaign has been consistently better than D'Amato's. Both \\nmen, however, have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting \\nfor legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages. \\nIn a precedent widely cited by D'Amato supporters, the organization \\nendorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, a Democrat, over the Republican challenger, \\nWilliam Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, even though Weld's \\nrecord on gay rights was considered stronger. The move angered gay \\nRepublicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that \\nthe group is biased toward Democrats. But there is clearly a large \\nnumber of Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who \\nstrongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage the group, \\nparticularly among women. They fear that abortion rights supporters \\nwill quit the group in droves because D'Amato has never wavered in \\nhis opposition to abortion during 18 years in Congress. Many New York \\ngay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorses D'Amato, \\nwhom they blame for installing the state Senate majority leader, Joseph \\nBruno, whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive \\ndirector of the Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role as \\n``the architect'' of the state Republican Party as a major reason \\nthe group endorsed Schumer. ``While he has criticized fellow Republicans \\nin Washington for their intolerance, here at home, his own party's \\nblatant discrimination is still the order of the day,'' Foreman said. \\nFor that reason, some White House officials say they think a Human \\nRights Campaign endorsement of D'Amato will be almost meaningless \\namong gay voters. They contend that it might even hurt the senator \\namong his conservative base. ``I don't think anybody will vote for \\nAl D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement,'' said a White House aide \\nwho spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``But I think some people \\nin the Right to Life Party and some upstate people are going to say, \\n`Who is this guy and why should we vote for him?''' \\n\\nIn a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said \\nFriday that he must ``live with the consequences'' of his mistakes, \\nalthough he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements \\nof his presidency and take heart from its possibilities. Clinton has \\nstopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he has \\ntaken to making glancing, at times humble, references to it, before \\nmoving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans' \\nneeds. He did so Friday at a series of fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, \\nhe acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country's \\neconomic strength, making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support \\nin an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland. After thanking the \\ngathered donors for the ``very kind personal things'' they had said \\nto him, the president declared, ``If I had to do it all over again, \\nevery day, I would do it in a heartbeat, to see America where it is \\ntoday as compared to six years ago.'' As the applause died away, Clinton \\ncontinued, ``I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live \\nwith the consequences of our mistakes in life.'' He added with a chuckle: \\n``Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way. \\nBut nobody gets out of life for free.'' To the music of a saxophone \\nand a hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised about $200,000 over lunch \\nin a private home in Cleveland for the Democratic Senate candidate \\nin Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then he flew to Philadelphia to raise half a \\nmillion dollars for the Democratic Party. By midsummer, the president's \\naides were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising \\nremarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing. \\nBut as his troubles have grown and the mid-term elections have approached, \\nhis free-form remarks have become longer. In Cleveland on Friday, \\nhe spoke for 26 minutes and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost \\n20 minutes. These fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since \\nClinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. He is lauded, \\napplauded and embraced by his hosts and the donors. ``Mr. President, \\nthese are your friends here today,'' said Tony George, the host of \\nthe Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who have played \\na similar role. But in Cleveland as elsewhere, protesters who were \\nscattered along the president's motorcade route were reminders of \\ncalls for his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some \\nare heaping upon his presidency. At a rally for the president outside \\ncity hall here Friday night a group of Teamsters chanted, ``two more \\nyears.'' Clinton's motorcade route was lined downtown with hundreds \\nof people, some of them carrying supportive or condemnatory signs. \\nAfter an impromptu shopping trip, during which he was greeted with \\nshouts of ``We love you,'' Clinton told some donors at the beginning \\nof an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: ``I didn't even \\nmind the protesters, that's the American way.'' But, he added, he \\npreferred it when they were in the minority, ``and that seemed to \\nbe the case.'' As he rode into Cleveland, Clinton passed a billboard \\nfor a local radio station, WNCX. ``Lovin', touchin', squeezin','' \\nit read, the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with \\nhis arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside \\nthem. The president left it to his aides on Friday to respond directly \\nto the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington. Instead, \\nin his remarks, Clinton spoke with pride of his record and with urgency \\nabout addressing the international economic crisis and the needs of \\nstruggling farmers and schoolchildren. As he typically does now before \\nsuch partisan audiences, he also walked through his political calculation \\nfor the mid-term elections. Clinton said in Cleveland that Republicans \\nhad bragged privately to him about their prospects. ``They tell me, \\n`Oh, we're going to do very well, Mr. President, in these mid-terms \\nbecause we have so much more money than you do,''' and because Democrats \\nwho turned out to re-elect Clinton would not return to the polls in \\nan off-year. That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton \\nfrom any blame for depressing the Democratic vote. But he often goes \\nfurther than that, saying that his predicament could actually help \\nthe Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not \\nbother to vote in a typical election. ``The people that were good \\nenough to serve you here at this event today, they've got a lot of \\nhassles in their life,'' he said. But, he said, ``adversity is our \\nfriend,'' because it can overcome apathy and ``focus us on what is \\nat issue here.'' What should be at issue, Clinton said, are his achievements \\nand agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly. \\n``What have they done?'' he asked in Cleveland. ``They killed the \\nminimum wage increase for 12 million Americans. They killed campaign \\nfinance reform. They killed the tobacco reform legislation.'' \\n\\nWhite House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's \\nlargest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse \\nSen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group \\nto try to shift its support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles \\nSchumer. Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights \\nCampaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the \\nclosely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation. \\nThey said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday. But privately, \\norganization officials and gay activists from both parties who have \\nbeen monitoring the debate say the group is most likely to endorse \\nD'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term. They also raised the \\npossibility that the group would endorse both candidates, or remain \\nneutral. If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on \\nthe condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three \\nmajor factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been searching \\nfor allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's \\nrecent record on gay issues to be quite strong. An endorsement by \\nthe group, which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voters, \\ncould prove important in swinging voters to D'Amato in a tight race. \\nIt would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator, who has \\nsought to recast himself as a centrist in recent years and could use \\nthe endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voters. \\nA D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts to portray \\nthe incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify to many \\nvoters a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition that has \\nincluded black and gay voters, women and labor unions. The intensity \\nof the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance \\nof the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see \\ndefeating D'Amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the \\nRepublicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate _ enough to stop a \\nDemocratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority. \\n``There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get \\n60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically \\nfor the next two years,'' said David Mixner, a close friend of President \\nClinton's who is gay. He was referring to the Senate majority leader, \\nwho has called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania. \\nSaturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's largest \\ngay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda. \\nAlthough the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been very \\nclose to the Clinton administration, has many Democrats on its board \\nand receives much of its money from Democratic contributors.

Dr. Rymer has won acclaim \\nas the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center, but this proposition \\nseemed particularly grand. When she returned the call, she said she \\nwas told she would also be named honorary chairman of an elite committee \\nto advise Gingrich on legislation. Too good to be true? Well, Dr. \\nRymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually \\nmeet, and as an honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would \\nbe a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen. \\nAnd oh, the speaker wanted a donation of $500 to $1,000 to ``help \\nour efforts,'' according to a transcript of a similar chat with another \\ndoctor, to elect a bigger Republican majority in the House of Representatives. \\nWith the approach of the midterm elections next month, it turns out \\nthat the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports \\ncandidates for the House, has been sponsoring similar calls to tens \\nof thousands of small-business owners, including doctors. With this \\nand other fund-raising programs, the committee says it has amassed \\n$62 million for the elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say \\nthe solicitations mark a new departure in political fund raising, \\none they call akin to the practices of marketing companies like the \\nPublishers' Clearing House that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar \\nwindfalls to induce them to subscribe to magazines. By citing the \\nspeaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, the calls \\nare a bait-and-switch scheme to seize the attention of people who \\nmight otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer says she was incensed. So was Dr. \\nStanley Turecki, a child and family psychiatrist in New York who votes \\nas an independent and was also called. ``I was absolutely outraged,'' \\nhe said. ``Anybody else who would do that would fall into the category \\nof consumer fraud.'' Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes \\nin election law and represents both Democratic and Republican clients, \\nsaid, ``I have never heard of that particular device.'' But it doesn't \\nappear illegal, he said, adding, ``It's a fund-raising gimmick to \\nget attention.'' Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit, \\nnonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform, said, ``This is a \\nnew version of caveat emptor _ buyer be damned instead of buyer beware.'' \\nWhen businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations. ``But \\nthis isn't going to be investigated because it's members of Congress \\nwho are doing it.'' Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National Republican \\nCongressional Committee, said that he had not heard of any complaints \\nand that there was no intent to deceive. ``The national leadership \\naward is a part of what we call donor and member fulfillment,'' Harris \\nsaid. ``It's part of bringing them into the process. It's important \\nthat they be recognized for the support they give the party.'' ``There's \\nno quid pro quo'' that people solicited could receive awards for past \\ncontributions, he added. What most peeves Drs. Rymer and Turecki is \\nthe message left with secretaries and answering machines invoking \\nGingrich's ``office'' and proposing the award. They say they envisioned \\na senior aide at a telephone in the speaker's chambers under the Capitol \\nDome. The calls, however, are not placed by aides to Gingrich, by \\nany of his offices or by anyone in Washington. They are made by people \\nwith headsets and computers at the home of InfoCision Management Corp., \\na telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client in Akron, \\nOhio. On its Web page, InfoCision says its 1,400 employees operate \\n1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers. ``Every word in the script \\nis approved by our clients,'' the company says on its Web site. ``Every \\nconceivable objection is scripted with a powerful rebuttal.'' Besides \\ntelemarketing for businesses, said Jamie Blair, a supervisor at the \\ncenter, ``we specialize in helping the Republican Party and conservative \\npolitical groups.'' However far they are from Gingrich, the telemarketers \\nare instructed to answer return calls with: ``Republican Congressional \\nCommittee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you?'' A doctor in Kansas \\nCity, Mo., who is a registered Republican and who declined to be named, \\ndialed the Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left on answering machines \\nand secretly recorded the ensuing discussion, which is legal in Missouri. \\n``We were asked to contact you on behalf of the speaker,'' says a \\nwoman who picked up the call and identified herself as Nancy. ``He \\nis right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut taxes by as much \\nas half, and he's also interested in legislation to cut capital gains \\nto a single rate of 15 percent.'' To assure passage of the legislation, \\nthe speaker wants to increase his Republican majority, she says, adding, \\n``To help us do that, the speaker is pulling together a group of individuals \\nsuch as yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on \\nhis advisory council.'' Nancy continues: ``There will be correspondence \\nwith the speaker, such as conference calls. It's a great way that \\nhe can get your input and thoughts on legislation that does concern \\nyou. Or maybe surveys or questionnaires.'' Later, Nancy says: ``As \\na member of his committee, you would be receiving from the speaker \\nour national leadership award, which is really quite an honor. And \\nto be honest, he will be asking each of our chairmen if they could \\nhelp our efforts to increase our majority with a one-time contribution \\nof $500 or $1,000. ``Now that would be used on the nationwide media \\ncampaign that Newt has undertaken to target those seats we really \\nneed. And as someone who I'm sure would also benefit from this, could \\nI tell the speaker he could count on your help?'' The doctor demurs. \\n``I am a registered, you know, Republican in Kansas,'' she tells Nancy. \\n``Probably if I were to do something it would be to go through my \\nown representative.'' Then the doctor tries to ascertain where Nancy \\nis located. ``Is this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talking \\nto?'' the doctor asks. ``The speaker's office,'' says Nancy. ``This \\nis the speaker's office.'' ``That I'm talking to,'' says the doctor, \\ndouble-checking. ``Uh-huh,'' Nancy replies. The law prohibits political \\nfund-raising calls from federal offices. Vice President Al Gore is \\nunder a Justice Department investigation for fund-raising calls he \\nallegedly made from his office in the 1996 presidential campaign. \\nBut the calls can be made from just about anywhere else, including \\ncampaign offices. Harris said the calls are ``in no way related to \\nthe speaker's OFFICIAL office.'' He added: ``What is more important \\nis not where the calls get routed. People are more interested in an \\naward with the speaker's good name on it than whether the call gets \\nrouted to Washington or Ohio.'' Turecki disagrees. ``I see it as basic \\nsleaze,'' he said. \\n\\nThe last time George Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election \\nas Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his \\nmost optimistic supporters and setting a 20th-century record for victory \\nmargins in Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, a Republican who is \\nbarred from seeking a third term, is running again, this time for \\nthe Senate seat held by John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring. And \\nwhile there are few who expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark \\nof four years ago, politicians of both parties generally acknowledge \\nthat he is well positioned to increase the Republican majority in \\nthe Senate. That has not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, \\nMary Boyle, from undertaking a vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, a former \\ncommissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing \\nthe nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describes as \\na grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a comparative shoestring, \\nhas nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known Democrats _ \\nPresident Clinton foremost among them _ on the campaign trail. Glenn, \\nthe former astronaut who is preparing to return to space this month \\nat the age of 77, has not made an endorsement in the Senate race. \\nLike many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard \\non the issue of education, seeking to portray Voinovich, 61, as a \\nlackluster steward who allowed the state's schools to decline. ``He \\npromised to be the education governor,'' said Ms. Boyle. ``But after \\nseven and a half years he has failed the students of this state.'' \\nHer role in the campaign, she said, ``is to remind the people of the \\nstate of Ohio that George Voinovich made a promise and that he didn't \\ndeliver on it.'' Specifically, she discusses a decision last year \\nby the Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparities in the quality \\nof the state's schools and ruled unconstitutional the formula for \\nfunding them. She has also attacked her Republican opponent for supporting \\na proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent. Under that \\nplan, half the additional funds would have been used for school improvement \\nwith the remainder earmarked for reducing property taxes. That statewide \\nballot initiative last May proved to be wildly unpopular, with about \\n80 percent of the voters opposing it. While the topics of taxes and \\neducation are hot ones this political season in Ohio, it is not clear \\nthat Ms. Boyle's emphasis on them has helped her campaign. Despite \\nsome narrowing in the opinion polls, she is still trailing Voinovich \\nby 10 percentage points in some polls and as much as 18 points in \\nothers. There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who \\nis running her first statewide race and has widespread union support, \\nhas raised nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7 million \\nVoinovich has taken in. Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, \\nhas been on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and \\nthus is the better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics of Ohio \\nare also aiding Voinovich. The northern half of the state, with its \\nhistory of industrial, unionized cities, has a tradition of voting \\nlargely for Democratic candidates, while the southern tier of the \\nstate is considered more conservative and typically leans Republican. \\nBut Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, depriving \\nMs. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies Democratic \\ncandidates. Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers \\nto the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. \\nAnd Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, has developed a reputation \\nas a moderate Republican who works well with Democrats. Voinovich, \\nwhile campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a full schedule of \\nofficial duties, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official. \\n``If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic \\npolicy than any member of the Senate,'' he said in an interview on \\nWednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a ribbon-cutting ceremony \\nand a fund-raising reception at a vacuum cleaner museum. ``As mayor, \\nI had my nose rubbed into the problems of urban America and was fairly \\nsuccessful in dealing with them. And, as governor, I have dealt with \\nthe problems of Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm the only person \\nin the United States who has been president of the National League \\nof Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association.'' To \\nhis opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich is dismissive. \\n``I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who has been \\nendorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National Education \\nAssociation,'' he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was a member of the \\nstate Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling. \\n``Mary Boyle was vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and \\na member of the Democratic leadership during those years,'' Voinovich \\nsaid. ``They did nothing to fix the buildings, they did nothing for \\ntechnology and the urban school districts.'' Ms. Boyle, who has not \\nyet begun to run campaign commercials on television, said her status \\nas the underdog had ``allowed me to be more focused, more intense.'' \\nPausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former Democratic \\nSen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: \\n``This has been a marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, \\nwe're down to the last three miles. It's a tough race.'' \\n\\nThe last time George Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election \\nas Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his \\nmost optimistic supporters and setting a 20th-century record for victory \\nmargins in Ohio politics.

Specifically, she discusses a decision last year \\nby the Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparities in the quality \\nof the state's schools and ruled unconstitutional the formula for \\nfunding them. She has also attacked her Republican opponent for supporting \\na proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent. Under that \\nplan, half the additional funds would have been used for school improvement \\nwith the remainder earmarked for reducing property taxes. That statewide \\nballot initiative last May proved to be wildly unpopular, with about \\n80 percent of the voters opposing it. While the topics of taxes and \\neducation are hot ones this political season in Ohio, it is not clear \\nthat Ms. Boyle's emphasis on them has helped her campaign. Despite \\nsome narrowing in the opinion polls, she is still trailing Voinovich \\nby 15 percentage points in some polls and as much as 20 points in \\nothers. There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who \\nis running her first statewide race and has widespread union support, \\nhas raised nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7 million \\nVoinovich has taken in. Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, \\nhas been on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and \\nthus is the better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics of Ohio \\nare also aiding Voinovich. The northern half of the state, with its \\nhistory of industrial, unionized cities, has a tradition of voting \\nlargely for Democratic candidates, while the southern tier of the \\nstate is considered more conservative and typically leans Republican. \\nBut Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, depriving \\nMs. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies Democratic \\ncandidates. Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers \\nto the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. \\nAnd Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, has developed a reputation \\nas a moderate Republican who works well with Democrats. Voinovich, \\nwhile campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a full schedule of \\nofficial duties, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official. \\n``If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic \\npolicy than any member of the Senate,'' he said in an interview on \\nWednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a ribbon-cutting ceremony \\nand a fund-raising reception at a vacuum cleaner museum. ``As mayor, \\nI had my nose rubbed into the problems of urban America and was fairly \\nsuccessful in dealing with them. And, as governor, I have dealt with \\nthe problems of Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm the only person \\nin the United States who has been president of the National League \\nof Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association.'' To \\nhis opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich is dismissive. \\n``I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who has been \\nendorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National Education \\nAssociation,'' he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was a member of the \\nstate Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling. \\n``Mary Boyle was vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and \\na member of the Democratic leadership during those years,'' Voinovich \\nsaid. ``They did nothing to fix the buildings, they did nothing for \\ntechnology and the urban school districts.'' Ms. Boyle, who has not \\nyet begun to run campaign commercials on television, said her status \\nas the underdog had ``allowed me to be more focused, more intense.'' \\nPausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former Democratic \\nSen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: \\n``This has been a marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, \\nwe're down to the last three miles. It's a tough race.'' \\n\\nNearly 60 years behind the times, the House voted Friday to condemn \\nthe Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939. The measure, a nonbinding \\nresolution, was brought to the floor by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. \\nHe is of Lithuanian descent, has a pocket of Lithuanians in his hometown \\nof Collinsville and wants to try to highlight his support for the \\nBaltic states' past efforts against Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure \\nis an example of how members of Congress are spending their time as \\nthey stand idle and wait for Republican leaders to reach agreement \\non spending bills with the White House, thus avoiding a government \\nshutdown and allowing them to go home and campaign for the November \\nelections. With time on their hands, many Republicans are using the \\nHouse floor as their personal stage to elicit votes on topics that \\nthey can boast about to the folks back home. Most of these matters \\nhave little chance of finding their way into law, but members hope \\nto turn them to their advantage on Election Day. There are plenty \\nof other items whose sponsors hope will not attract attention. These \\ntend to be special-interest matters that members hope will escape \\nscrutiny in the rush to leave town. The sponsors of these measures \\nnow have the added advantage of the impeachment inquiry, which has \\nbeen preoccupying Congress, the news media and the public and giving \\nthem cover to move their pet causes quietly into the gigantic omnibus \\npackage that Congress will eventually present to Clinton for signing. \\nThese quieter measures include one proposed by Mississippi's two senators, \\nTrent Lott and Thad Cochran, both Republicans. They want agriculture \\nexport credits to buy chickens for Russia, which has bought the chickens \\nbut cannot pay for them. The chickens are from Mississippi. Democrats \\nhave little influence in the Republican-controlled Congress. But some \\nDemocrats are close enough to Republican leaders, and to Republican \\ngoals, that their measures are taken seriously. These include Rep. \\nJohn Murtha, D-Pa., the ranking Democrat on the national security \\nsubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, who is pushing a measure \\nto increase military pensions. Perhaps the best example of an attempt \\nto force a vote for political advantage is a measure that would require \\nminors to notify their parents if they are seeking contraceptives \\nfrom federally funded family planning clinics. House leaders allowed \\nthe measure to be brought to the floor as a way to appease the more \\nconservative members, who believe they have been shortchanged by the \\nbudget process. It passed the House by a vote of 224-200 but has almost \\nno chance of becoming law. The Senate does not plan to take it up, \\nand Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., \\nsaid that votes like these were important because they put their sponsors' \\nideological foes on the record as opposing something that sounds reasonable, \\nand that opposition can be used against them in the Nov. 3 election. \\n\\nIn other election years, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would \\nhave had little in common other than that they were Democrats with \\nrelatively safe seats. Price is a centrist who has represented this \\nhigh-tech district in North Carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 \\nyears, a political scientist who has taught at Duke and Yale. Mrs. \\nCarson, fairly liberal, is a House freshman who worked her way up \\nin politics from the grass roots, having been reared in poverty. But \\nparty officials who opened this election year with high hopes of recapturing \\nthe House are beginning to worry that Democratic incumbents like Price \\nand Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril \\non Election Day. As in many congressional races, the biggest variable \\nis the White House scandal, which has injected fear and uncertainty \\ninto campaigns around the country. Other Democratic incumbents who \\nRepublican officials cite as locked in contests that are more competitive \\nthan expected include Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida, Vic Snyder of \\nArkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher of California, Martin Frost \\nof Texas, Melvin Watt of North Carolina, John LaFalce of New York \\nand Sander Levin of Michigan. Here in North Carolina's 4th Congressional \\nDistrict, Price, acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a \\ntight race, said: ``This is a swing district that is sensitive to \\nany tide or trend. It's something you think about a lot in connection \\nwith the president's troubles.'' The efforts of Price and Mrs. Carson \\nto contain the Lewinsky debacle _ and their opponents' attempts to \\ncapitalize on it _ offer important clues suggesting how Clinton's \\nproblems are influencing the conduct of races around the country. \\nMany Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with \\nevery new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close \\nto a president whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing the \\npossibility of a public backlash against Republicans, they are weighing \\ntheir words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon. \\nAnd while publicly these Democrats express confidence that the scandal \\nwill have little impact on them, their campaigns are preparing for \\nthe worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-efforts \\nto prod their core constituencies to vote. In a reflection of the \\nuncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans, \\nthe challengers in the Price and Carson districts _ both are political \\nnovices seeking office for the first time _ have differing strategies: \\nTom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Price, \\nhas broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal. ``Tom \\nRoberg has called for Bill Clinton's resignation,'' the narrator says. \\n``This is not the time to be silent, Price. Where do you stand?'' \\nBut in Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging \\nMrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a \\nmore subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he \\nnotes as often as he can that ``Julia votes with Clinton almost 100 \\npercent of the time.'' Asked why he was not much raising the scandal \\ndirectly, Hofmeister said: ``Don't murder somebody when they're in \\nthe process of committing suicide. There would be a danger if we went \\noverboard.'' The best evidence of the discomfort of both Price and \\nMrs. Carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they \\nwould want Clinton to campaign in their districts, both said it would \\nbe impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a \\nvisit. What if there was a sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed \\na bit and mustered answers that were hardly affirmative. ``Given the \\npresident's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me,'' Mrs. Carson said. \\nAnd Price? ``I don't think that would be such a good idea,'' he said. \\n``I've never had a president campaign here, and I wouldn't want to \\nstart this time'' although he is eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, \\nthe president's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina, \\nto stump with him here this Sunday.) Making strategy for the stump \\nis further complicated by anecdotal evidence that runs counter to \\nDemocratic fears and Republican hopes. In three days of campaign stops \\nhere in North Carolina and in Indianapolis, the scandal was rarely \\nraised by any voter being courted by the candidates of either party. \\nWhen a reporter asked about it, many voters said that as appalled \\nas they were at Clinton's behavior, they had a hard time relating \\nit to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections \\nin five weeks. As Hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside \\na gun and knife show at the Indiana National Guard Armory in Indianapolis \\nlast Sunday, Billy Derringer, a 57-year-old machinist who is retired \\non disability, called him over to express outrage about the millions \\nof dollars that had been spent to investigate Clinton. ``It's pathetic \\nto spend all of our money,'' said Derringer, who identified himself \\nas an independent. ``It shouldn't have gotten this far.'' Hofmeister \\ntried his best to make the Republicans' case. ``There has to be rule \\nof law,'' he said. Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing \\nvoters alike would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that \\nthe issue might even help her. To that end, she proudly informs audiences \\nthat she voted against making public the report delivered to the House \\nby Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. ``I was one \\nof 63 members of Congress who voted against putting all that filth \\non the Internet,'' she said, adding that Starr's inquiry had been \\n``a cruel hoax in terms of fiscal responsibility and accountability.'' \\nThe Carson campaign is counting on voters like Timothy Daly, a 38-year-old \\nreal estate executive who voted for a Republican two years ago but \\nnow favors Mrs. Carson. ``I'm pulling the Democratic ticket because \\nI'm tired of it: the right side of the Republican Party is playing \\npolitics,'' Daly said. ``We'd like to see them go on with the people's \\nbusiness.'' Back here in the 4th District, Price has some reasons \\nto be worried. He was first elected to the House in 1986 but, as a \\nfour-term incumbent, was ousted in the Republican sweep of 1994 (only \\nto win his seat back two years later). In addition, the district was \\nredrawn last year to include a large Durham section where voters do \\nnot know him well. Determined not to be a midterm casualty of Clinton \\nonce again, Price says he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote \\nground campaign of his career. Rather than engage Roberg over the \\nClinton scandal, Price has begun broadcasting a television commercial \\nthat emphasizes his central issue: education. The congressman's advisers \\nsay they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly \\nnonpolitical _ it features school children in a play _ in an effort \\nto break through the television clutter about the scandal. But the \\nPrice campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve, in the \\nevent Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton scandal to advantage: \\nthe incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid about running \\ncommercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting \\nhis doctorate in political science. At a coffee with voters in a wealthy \\nenclave of Raleigh the other night, Roberg opened his remarks by asserting \\nthat Clinton had ``lost the moral authority to lead.'' Yet none of \\nthose assembled asked him about the scandal; they were more concerned \\nabout the state's plans to build a highway near their neighborhood. \\n\\nSen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who is running for re-election, \\nwent to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal the other morning to accept \\nan award from mass-transit advocates. But the reporters who had gathered \\nthere showed little interest in the shiny train car at the senator's \\nback. Instead, they repeatedly asked him how he would vote on an impeachment \\nof President Clinton. ``Look, I'm not going to make any comment with \\nrespect to that subject matter,'' D'Amato responded. ``I am not just \\na citizen. I am a citizen-senator who may be called upon to make a \\ndecision.'' But D'Amato is something else as well: a candidate in \\nwhat may be the tightest Senate race in the nation. And variations \\nof his elliptical response can be heard in Senate races around the \\ncountry, where both Republicans and Democrats are encountering similar \\nquestions. All of which suggests that after the House voted Thursday \\nto authorize an impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 races for the \\nU.S. Senate have become, beyond what they already were, the electoral \\nequivalent of jury selection. If the House votes to impeach Clinton, \\nthe matter goes to the Senate, which must decide by a two-thirds majority \\nwhether to convict him and, thus, remove him from office. As a result, \\nthe Monica Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new disruptive \\nforce into the Senate contests. Voters, even those who support Clinton, \\nexpect their political leaders, Republican or Democratic, to renounce \\nClinton's behavior, and candidates have been doing that. But impeachment \\nis another matter; most polls show the nation is against it. The danger \\nfor Senate candidates is that with impeachment now a real possibility, \\nthe debate may move beyond the president's behavior _ about which \\nthere is little disagreement _ to the more problematic issue of whether \\nhe should be removed from office. For most of the strategists involved \\nin the races, there is little guidance on how to handle the impeachment \\nissue. Advisers to candidates of both parties said in interviews last \\nweek that they were perplexed and worried, unsure what they can or \\nshould do on the issue to gain the advantage _ or guard against harm. \\n``I can't tell how this one is going to go,'' said Mike Russell, a \\nspokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``This \\nis a very surreal environment.'' Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 18 \\nare held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans, who now hold 55 seats \\nin all. Republicans would have to win 28 of the 34 races to produce \\nthe 67 votes necessary for conviction, assuming such a vote were to \\ngo along party lines. Only an electoral catastrophe for the Democrats, \\nwhich seems almost unthinkable, could produce such a huge loss. Jennifer \\nDuffy, who follows Senate races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan \\nnewsletter, said that so far, at least, none of the Senate candidates \\nhas made an explicit appeal for votes based on how they would vote \\non a presidential jury. But she and others are wondering if this may \\nbe about to change. This is difficult ground to measure. One of the \\ncentral questions of this political year has been how Clinton's dealings \\nwith Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For a long time, politicians \\nassumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home as a rebuke to Clinton, \\njust as many Republicans did in November 1974, three months after \\nPresident Richard M. Nixon resigned. But now some analysts wonder \\nif the partisan fight in Congress last week might have the opposite \\neffect among some Democrats. ``That's the problem,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, \\nthe editor of an independent political newsletter in Washington. ``It's \\nnot that we don't know, and that the politicians don't know, where \\nthe general public stands on impeachment. The problem is that we don't \\nknow where the electorate stands on impeachment.'' And asking voters \\nto think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots \\nin a Senate race is, in the words of Stuart Stevens, a Republican \\nconsultant, ``a double bank-shot.'' Such strategies, he said, tend \\nto work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated \\nvoters. Against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking \\nis that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race, \\nstate to state and week to week, depending on the circumstances of \\nthe candidates and the composition of the electorate. If Democrats \\ntry to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage, it \\nwould be in states with a Democratic edge or with sizable numbers \\nof black voters, who overwhelmingly support the president. In contests \\nlike those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a Democratic \\ncandidate to, as one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera \\nand tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president's \\nbehavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment. Strategists \\nin both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective. \\n``This is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites \\nand the public,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic consultant with clients \\nin Wisconsin and the Carolinas. That kind of Democratic strategy might \\nemerge in California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and \\nperhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats in South Carolina, Georgia \\nand Nevada would be less likely to oppose Clinton's impeachment. On \\nthe other side, Republican consultants are telling their candidates \\nto stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment. \\nThe last thing the party wants is to turn the Senate elections into \\na referendum on whether Clinton should be forced from office. ``The \\nWhite House might think from the overall public numbers that maybe \\nthey would like to make this a referendum election,'' said Ed Goeas, \\na Republican pollster who is working in Senate races this year. ``Republicans \\ncertainly aren't going to let that happen.'' D'Amato responded to \\nquestions about Clinton with the language that Republican consultants \\nhave been suggesting to their candidates. ``When and if that matter \\ncomes to the Senate, I will decide on the facts that are presented \\nto me at that time,'' D'Amato said. ``It would be very premature for \\nme to suggest any course of action without it being referred. Because, \\nindeed, we may be called upon to act as a jury of some kind.'' But \\nSchumer, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting \\nthe impeachment investigation, virtually embraced the issue. In a \\nlive telecast of the hearings, he said the president deserved a lesser \\npunishment, such as censure or reprimand. And Schumer plans to campaign \\nin New York on Monday with Clinton at his side. Schumer's media adviser, \\nHank Morris, seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow \\nas an issue. ``Senator D'Amato claims he does not want to share his \\nopinion with the people of New York,'' Morris said. ``And if he doesn't \\nhave an opinion, he's the only New Yorker who doesn't have an opinion.'' \\nAsked if Schumer would raise the issue in a television commercial, \\nMorris responded: ``We don't talk about what we're going to do. I \\nwouldn't rule it in and I wouldn't rule it out.'' \\n\", \"\\nFollowing is the text of the rules on gifts and benefits that were \\nin force during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics: _ ``The \\nfinalist cities as well as third parties acting for them or on their \\nbehalf or in their favor, are forbidden to give IOC members _ as well \\nas their blood relations, relatives by marriage, guests or companions \\n_ any presents, liberalities or direct or indirect benefits other \\nthan souvenirs ot small presents of a total value which shall in no \\ncase exceed U.S. dlrs 150 per person.'' _ ``Finalist cities and any \\nthird parties acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor \\nare forbidden to conclude with IOC members, their relations, relatives \\nby marriage, their guests or companions, agreements, transactions \\nor any other contracts.'' _ ``In the event of a serious breach of \\nthe present regulations, the IOC executive board may further propose \\nto the IOC session that it exclude the city having breached the regulation \\nfrom the contest for the games.'' \\n\\nLAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch \\non Sunday promised to expel any members if they are found guilty of \\naccepting bribes. Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations \\nof corruption in the International Olympic Committee made by senior \\nSwiss member Marc Hodler. But he said the allegations would be considered \\nby a special IOC panel looking into alleged rules violations by the \\nSalt Lake group which won the 2002 Winter Games. ``If it is necessary, \\nwe will expel members if this commission feels these members are guilty,'' \\nSamaranch said at a news conference. ``After we get the recommendations \\nof the panel, we will take the measures necessary to arrange the problem.'' \\nSamaranch said the IOC was intent on protecting the integrity of the \\norganization and the Olympics as a whole. ``If we have to clean, we \\nwill clean,'' he said. ``After, the IOC will be even stronger than \\nbefore.'' Samaranch said he was taken aback by Hodler's allegations, \\nwhich were made to reporters Saturday. Samaranch said Hodler should \\nhave brought his allegations first to the IOC executive board. ``For \\nme, I was really surprised. If he has names and evidence, he must \\ngo to the executive board.'' Hodler said he believed four agents _ \\nincluding one IOC member _ had been involved in vote-buying over the \\npast 10 years. He said he thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members \\n_ currently numbering 115 _ were open to bribery. Samaranch denied \\nthat he ``muzzled'' Hodler, as the Swiss official claimed earlier \\nSunday. He said he had told all members of the executive board that \\nonly himself and director general Francois Carrad could speak to the \\nmedia. ``This is not the first time I do this,'' he said. Samaranch \\nexpressed his respect and admiration for Hodler and ruled out the \\npossbility of expelling him from the IOC, an option the Swiss member \\nhad raised. ``Never, never, is anyone thinking to expel Mr. Hodler,'' \\nSamaranch said. The IOC also ruled out any possibility of stripping \\nSalt Lake City of the games over alleged rules violations during the \\nbid. ``No, there is not any kind of possibiity,'' he said. ``We trust \\nthe organizing committee of Salt Lake City.'' The Salt Lake controvery \\ncenters on a scholarship program that provided nearly dlrs 400,000 \\nin tuition and other assistance to 13 individuals _ including six \\nrelatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa. Samaranch said the IOC \\nwould possibly consider a new procedure to eliminate the tempations \\nfor corruption in the selection of host cities. Under current rules, \\nall IOC members have a vote. Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the \\nformula used by sports federations such as FIFA, world soccer's governing \\nbody, which assign their executive boards to select sites. \\n\\nWhat started as a local controversy in Salt Lake City has evolved \\ninto a full-blown international scandal. The International Olympic \\nCommittee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of \\nnearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by \\nthe Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC \\nexecutive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund _ described \\nas ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a ``bribe.'' \\n``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best place \\nto hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in order to \\nget the vote,'' Hodler said. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch \\nassigned the international body's juridical commission _ which deals \\nwith legal and ethical issues _ to investigate. The inquiry will be \\nheaded by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a highly respected \\nformer World Court judge. The scholarship fund was first disclosed \\ntwo weeks ago by a Salt Lake radio station. The controversy is now \\nbound to overshadow the routine progress report which the Salt Lake \\nOlympic Committee (SLOC) is scheduled to make to the IOC executive \\nboard this weekend. SLOC president Frank Joklik, who arrived in Lausanne \\nFriday, welcomed the IOC investigation. ``I think that's who the matter \\nshould be taken up by,'' he told The Associated Press. `` Of course, \\nwe intend to collaborate fully with the IOC and its investigation.'' \\nJoklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's image. \\n``I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now,'' he said. \\nAsked about Hodler's accusation of bribery, Joklik said he hadn't \\nseen the remarks yet and couldn't reply directly. But he sought to \\ndistance himself from the allegations by making a distinction between \\nthe actions of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee. \\n``Presumably (Hodler's) remarks are related to actions of the bid \\ncommitee before 1995,'' Joklik said. ``The organizing committee certainly \\nhas people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any \\ninvestigation. The facts were in the early 1990s when the bid committee \\nwas operating.'' U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John \\nKrimsky described the controversy as ``disruptive'' for Salt Lake's \\nimage and preparations for the games. ``It doesn't do us any good \\nat all,'' he said. ``I hope we see a speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's \\nreview. I hope it will be a footnote. I hope it never becomes a chapter.'' \\nSalt Lake organizers, 10th graf pvs \\n\\nSaying ``if we have to clean, we will clean,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch \\nresponded on Sunday to allegations of corruption in the Olympic bidding \\nprocess by declaring that IOC members who were found to have accepted \\nbribes from candidate cities could be expelled. ``It is a serious \\nproblem we have before us,'' Samaranch, president of the International \\nOlympic Committee, said in a hastily arranged news conference at a \\ntumultuous meeting of the IOC executive board. Samaranch compared \\nthe current climate to the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics in \\nLos Angeles and the sprinter Ben Johnson's expulsion from the 1988 \\nOlympics in Seoul, South Korea. ``Those were difficult moments,'' \\nSamaranch said. ``Now we are facing another difficult moment, but \\nI'm sure we will solve this problem.'' Samaranch expressed surprise \\nat allegations made by the IOC executive board member Marc Hodler \\nof Switzerland that agents were offering to sell I.O.C. members' votes \\nfor payments from bidding cities. Hodler, the second most senior member \\nof the IOC, said Saturday that he knew of four agents, including one \\nIOC member, who engaged in such activities. Hodler said he believed \\nthat 5 to 7 percent of the IOC membership, which currently numbers \\n115, asked for some sort of compensation for their vote. He has called \\nfor a new electoral process, in which the executive board or some \\nother select IOC group would decide which cities become Olympic hosts \\ninstead of the full IOC membership. Samaranch agreed Sunday that the \\ntime had come to explore change. ``The system we have now is very \\ncomplicated, very slow and very expensive,'' he said. Hodler, the \\nformer head of the International Ski Federation, also claimed that \\nthe Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free vans to influence votes \\nfor the Italian resort of Sestriere to hold the 1997 world skiing \\nchampionships. Fiat denied the claims on Saturday, but Sunday Howard \\nPeterson, a former senior American delegate to the ski federation, \\nsaid he had been offered cars by two Fiat executives. The issue of \\nvote-buying came to the fore in Lausanne because of the recent disclosure \\nof scholarship payments made to six relatives of IOC members by Salt \\nLake City officials during their successful bid to play host to the \\n2002 Winter Games. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has said the \\npayments, which amounted to slightly less than $400,000, came from \\na privately financed fund that was started in 1991. And Intermountain \\nHealth Care, Utah's largest health care provider, confirmed Sunday \\nthat it gave free surgical services to at least two people associated \\nwith the IOC in 1994. A special commission headed by the IOC vice \\npresident Dick Pound was appointed on Friday to investigate the issue \\nand has met with Salt Lake officials. Sunday, Frank Joklik, president \\nof the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, issued a public apology to \\nthe ``Olympic family and the citizens of Utah'' for the embarrassment \\ncaused by the scholarships program. Samaranch Sunday ruled out taking \\nthe Games from Salt Lake City. He said, ``If necessary we will expel \\nmembers if this ad hoc commission thinks these members are guilty.'' \\nPound said his commission was already ``satisfied Salt Lake City won \\nthe 2002 Games on the merit of the bid.'' He also said that his commission \\nwould expand its inquiry beyond the Salt Lake City bid only if it \\nwas presented with evidence and not simply rumors of corruption in \\nother bids. On Saturday, Hodler had suggested the bidding teams from \\nAtlanta and Nagano, Japan, that won the 1996 Summer Olympics and 1998 \\nWinter Olympics had not run ``clean'' campaigns. Billy Payne, who \\npresided over Atlanta's bid, and Makoto Kobayashi, the general secretary \\nof the Nagano organizing committee, denied those claims. Asked whether \\nhe regretted his statements Sunday, Hodler said, ``Not at all'' and \\nlater said that ``the cities have been the victims and not the villains.'' \\nPound said there had been concern in the IOC for some time about agents. \\n``There always have been lobbyists,'' he said. ``In recent years, \\nespecially with the Olympics coming up every two years, there seems \\nto be a professional class being created.'' Hodler, when pressed for \\nfurther comment this afternoon at Olympic headquarters, initially \\ncovered his mouth with both hands and then said, ``Muzzle imposed \\nby the president.'' Hodler, 80, is one of only four IOC members with \\nlife membership because he was appointed before age limits were imposed \\nin 1966. Asked if he might resign he said, ``I'm not going to resign, \\nbut I might be expelled.'' But the 78-year-old Samaranch said he had \\n``great respect'' for Hodler and no intention of asking for his resignation \\nor pushing for his expulsion. \\n\\nA top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegations of widespread \\nOlympic corruption, saying agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver \\nvotes in the selection of host cities. Marc Hodler, a senior member \\nof the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices \\nin the voting for the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics and \\n2002 Salt Lake Games. Hodler said a group of four agents, including \\none IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment. \\nHe declined to identify them. ``The four agents try to make a living \\nout of this,'' he said. ``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some \\nof the agents do the following: they say, `I can offer this or that \\nnumber of votes.' ``The price wold be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs \\n1 million for a number of votes, a bloc.'' Hodler added that the agents \\nthen charge the city winning the bid ``something like dlrs 3 million \\nto dlrs 5 millon.'' Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there \\nis one agent who boasts ``that no city has ever won the Olympic Games \\nwithout his help.'' ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said. IOC president \\nJuan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler's \\nallegations. ``The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board \\nis (director general) Francois Carrard,'' Samaranch said. ``All the \\nother comments are personal comments. They are not official comments.'' \\nHodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the IOC \\ncontinued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the \\nSalt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games. Hodler \\nhas described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set \\nup by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC members. \\nIt also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic \\nbid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for votes. Bruce \\nBaird, the former New South Wales minister, said he refused. Asked \\nwhether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games was clean, \\nHodler said, ``Certainly not.' Asked whether Sydney's election was \\nclean, he said, ``I would be surprised. I know what happened but I \\ndon't want to disclose it.'' ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different \\nfrom the others,'' he said. ``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, \\nclean, clean.'' Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt \\nLake organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the \\ncontroversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former \\nbid chief Thomas Welch. ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, \\n`Everything had been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more. \\nWe know nothing.' My experience is that this is not true.'' The controversy \\ncenters on scholarships _ including tuition assistance and athlete \\ntraining programs _ paid to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake \\nbid committee. From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction \\nof Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals \\n_ six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.

He promises he will give enough votes so (the biddding city) \\ncan win.'' Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, \\n``I know of so many times. There is a good chance it is always the \\ncase.'' IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated \\nhimself from Hodler's allegations. ``The only official spokeman for \\nthe IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard,'' \\nSamaranch said. ``All the other comments are personal comments.

John Krimsky, \\ndeputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic Committee, disputed Hodler's \\nassertion. ``There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at \\nthis point,'' Krimsky said. ``All these issues should be put to the \\nIOC review commission.'' Hodler also leveled allegations against the \\nhead of the Athens bid which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote. Hodler \\nsaid he overheard Spyros Metaxa, a wealthy Greek businessman who led \\nthe bid, describing Samaranch and IOC members as ``stupid'' for imposing \\nrestrictions on the bidding process. ``For me there is only one purpose: \\nwinning the games,'' Hodler quoted Metaxa as saying. ``I will do whatever \\nis necessary to win the games _ if it costs me dlrs 100,000, dlrs \\n10 million or dlrs 100 million.'' Hodler said he didn't know of any \\nmisconduct in Athens' successful bid for the 2004 games. Asked whether \\nSydney's election for the 2000 games was clean, Hodler said, ``I would \\nbe surprised. I know what happened but I don't want to disclose it.'' \\n``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others,'' he said. \\n``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.'' The committee \\nwhich won the 1998 games for Nagano ``certainly had to do things which \\nare not legitimate,'' Hodler said. Hodler contested the argument by \\nthe current Salt Lake organizing committee that it was not directly \\ninvolved in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus \\nwas on former bid chief Thomas Welch. ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt \\nLake City said, `Everything had been done by Tom Welch, who is not \\nthere any more. We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not \\ntrue.'' The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition \\nassistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC \\nmembers by the Salt Lake bid committee. From 1991 to 1995, the committee \\n_ under the direction of Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships \\nto 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from \\nAfrica. The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of \\nthe bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was \\nalso a high official on the bid committee. Hodler said the blame shud \\nbe on those ``who put pressure'' on Salt Lake to offer the scholarship \\nfunds. ``Nobody blames Salt Lake City,'' he said. ``We blame those \\nvoters who can be bought _ not Salt Lake City. They were a victim. \\nWe should thank them for not paying money _ only scholarships.'' Joklik \\non Saturday denied any payment for votes. ``I don't even know what \\nagents are,'' he said. \\n\\nThe mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter \\nOlympics, denied allegations that city officials bribed members of \\nthe International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the games. \\nNagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada was responding to allegations by Marc \\nHodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, of systematic \\nbuying and selling of the Olympic Games. ``I have never heard of such \\na thing,'' Tsukada told the Associated Press Sunday. ``As far as Nagano \\nis concerned, we haven't done anything wrong. We were selected as \\nhost of the Olympics through our efforts. We can't believe that Mr. \\nHodler has made such a statement,'' he said. Tsukada was vice chairman \\nof the Japanese committee to invite the Olympics to Nagano. Nagano \\nhas been criticized for spending a large amount of money to win the \\ngames. Sports Nippon, a leading Japanese sports newspaper, said more \\nthan 2 billion yen (dlrs 17 million) of the money Nagano spent to \\nbring the games there has not been accounted for. Japan Olympic Committee \\nhas warned cities seeking to host the games in the future that they \\nshould not entertain IOC members excessively, the newspaper said. \\nHolder's accusation might effect the invitation activities for the \\n2008 summer Olympics by Osaka, Japan's second largest city, the paper \\nsaid. Osaka is competing with Beijing, China and other cities for \\nthe right to host the games. Nagano became the first Asian city to \\nhost the Winter Games since Sapporo, Japan played host to the 1972 \\ngames. Eighty-eight IOC members took part in a secret vote in 1991 \\nto decide who would host the 1998 games. Nagano led in each of the \\nfive rounds, beating out Salt Lake city 46 votes to 42 in the final \\nballot. \\n\\nSwiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might \\nbe thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegations \\nof corruption within the Olympic movement. Asked whether he might \\nresign, Hodler said, ``No, I don't resign. But maybe I will be expelled. \\nYou never know.'' Hodler, who made the allegations Saturday, said \\nhe has since been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. \\nHis comments came as the leader of the Salt Lake organizing committee \\napologized Sunday for the alleged rules violations during the city's \\nsuccessful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The IOC, meanwhile, said \\nit was prepared to investigate allegations made by Hodler of bribery \\nin the selection of Olympic host cities. Frank Joklik, 4th graf pvs \\n\\nMoving quickly to tackle an escalating corruption scandal, IOC leaders \\nquestioned Salt Lake City officials Friday in the first ever investigation \\ninto alleged vote-buying by an Olympic city. Acting with unusual speed, \\nthe International Olympic Committee set up a special investigative \\npanel that immediately summoned the organizers of the 2002 Salt Lake \\nGames to address the bribery allegations. The chief investigator refused \\nto rule out the possibility of taking the games away from Salt Lake \\nCity _ though that scenario is considered highly unlikely. Frank Joklik, \\npresident of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and SLOC senior vice \\npresident Dave Johnson appeared before the IOC panel for 90 minutes \\nFriday night. Both sides declined to comment after the talks, saying \\nthe inquiry was still in process. Earlier, Joklik met with IOC president \\nJuan Antonio Samaranch and other top officials to provide information \\nand documents on the case. The controversy centers on the payment \\nof nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members \\nby the Salt Lake bid committee which won the right to stage the 2002 \\ngames. Senior IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship \\nfund _ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ \\namounted to a bribe to sway votes in the 1995 election. It's the most \\nserious case of alleged ethical misconduct investigated by the IOC \\nsince former U.S. member Robert Helmick was accused of conflict of \\ninterest in 1991. Helmick eventually resigned both as an IOC member \\nand as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. This is the first \\ntime the IOC has ever investigated possible bribery by bidding cities, \\ndespite previous rumors and allegations of corruption in other Olympic \\nvotes. ``The executive board takes this matter very seriously,'' said \\nDick Pound, the IOC vice president heading the Salt Lake inquiry. \\n``Despite many requests made in the past or evidence to support rumors \\nthat have been floating around, we have never had anything come forward. \\n``Specific allegations have now been made. The executive board acted \\nvery quickly to investigate.'' Also on the investigative panel are \\nIOC vice president Keba Mbaye, executive board members Jacques Rogge \\nand Thomas Bach, and IOC director general Francois Carrard. Pound \\nsaid the panel would investigate allegations that ``there may or may \\nnot have been payments for the benefit of members of the IOC or their \\nfamilies connected with the Salt Lake City bid.'' Pound, a Canadian \\nlawyer, said there was no deadline for completion of the investigation \\nbut said it was possible the inquiry could be wrapped up this weekend. \\nPound declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions could be \\ntaken against Salt Lake but did not rule out moving the games elsewhere. \\n``We're not going to make any conclusions or any speculations as to \\nwhat we may decide until we know what the facts are,'' he said. Moving \\nthe games would be unprecedented and, with just over three years to \\ngo, would be a logistical nightmare. Most of the facilities needed \\nfor the games in Salt Lake already are built. John Krimsky, deputy \\nsecretary general of the U.S. Olympic Committee, discounted any possibility \\nof the games being moved. ``There is no chance at all, absolutely \\nnone in my mind,'' he said. ``I can't be stronger in saying I don't \\nconsider it a possibility whatsoever of the games being withdrawn \\nfrom Salt Lake City. '' Salt Lake organizers have denied that the \\nbid committee's dlrs 500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC \\nmembers' support in the four years between votes on the 1998 and 2002 \\nWinter Games. Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, \\nwhen the program was begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland, \\nfor the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting. From 1991 to 1995, the bid \\ncommittee _ under the direction of former president Thomas Welch _ \\nspent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six \\nof them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa. Olympic rules \\nprohibit bidding cities from giving IOC members or their relatives \\nany presents or benefits exceeding a value of dlrs 150. ``I've already \\nstated I do not regard what was done as a bribe,'' Joklik said Friday. \\n``I recognize there have been perceptions contrary to that. I regret \\nthose perceptions, but I don't feel they are justified.'' Joklik was \\nchairman of the bid committee at the time, the No. 2 official behind \\nWelch. Welch resigned last year as president of the organizing committee \\nafter being accused of domestic violence against his wife. He currently \\nserves as a SLOC consultant. ``The organizing committee certainly \\nhas people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any \\ninvestigation,'' Joklik said. ``The facts were in the early 1990s \\nwhen the bid committee was operating.'' Among those identified as \\nreceiving scholarship funds was Sonia Essomba, the daughter of the \\nlate Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, \\nwas the secretary general of the National Olympic Committees of Africa. \\n\\nThe senior Olympic official who leveled stunning allegations of corruption \\nwithin the IOC said Sunday he had been ``muzzled'' by president Juan \\nAntonio Samaranch and might be throw out of the organization. Marc \\nHodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, said Samaranch \\nhad ordered him to keep quiet. He said he was told not to appear at \\na scheduled routine news conference. Asked whether he might resign, \\nHodler said, ``No, I don't resign. But maybe I will be expelled. You \\nnever know.'' Hodler was, 3rd graf pvs \\n\", \"\\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's \\nsupport Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear \\nsite, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander \\nan historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula. President \\nKim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged \\nthat his government would ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. \\nendeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question. He called for full access \\nfor U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility and said \\nthe North must constrain its development and exports of missiles. \\nOn the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held a roundtable \\ndiscussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for putting \\nthe nation's economy back on track. Economics and security are Clinton's \\ntwin themes on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. Clinton acknowledged \\nthat U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the suspicious \\nunderground construction project in North Korea is nuclear related. \\nBut he said the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it \\nrefuses a U.S. inspection of the site. ``It raises a strong suspicion,'' \\nClinton said at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, \\nthe presidential mansion overlooking the capital. ``We need access \\nto it.'' The foundation of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long \\nhostility toward the South is a 1994 ``agreed framework'' in which \\nthe North halted its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western \\ncommitment to build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal \\nwould be shattered if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine \\nnuclear project. And that, in turn, would jeopardize preliminary North-South \\npeace talks that could produce a treaty to replace the shaky armistice \\nthat ended the Korean War in 1953. Kim, who has moved South Korea \\nto a ``sunshine'' policy of engaging North Korea on cultural and economic \\nfronts, firmly said his government supports Clinton on the nuclear \\nissue. ``We must require full access and ways to ascertain the nature \\nand the purposes of the construction site,'' Kim said. ``If it is, \\nin fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should demand immediate \\nclose down.'' He also said the North must limit its missile development, \\nciting the ``great shock'' in Japan when the North Koreans test-fired \\na missile its way Aug. 31. In a dinner toast, Kim said that despite \\ntensions, ``North Korea is cautiously but noticeably taking measures \\nto increase interaction and cooperation between the South and the \\nNorth.'' And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle against Asia's economic \\nwoes. ``I believe Asia will emerge from this present crisis more prosperous, \\nmore stable, more democratic _ thanks in no small measure to Korea's \\nexample.'' After the state dinner, Clinton made a surprise late-night \\nstop at a concert at the Sejong Culture Center where his younger brother, \\nRoger, and his band were performing. The president listened to songs \\noff stage before his brother introduced the president as ``a very \\nspecial person.'' The audience of 2,000 people stood and applauded. \\nIn meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. \\nofficials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious underground \\nsite, which American intelligence officials fear could be a secret \\neffort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program. U.S. spy satellite \\nphotos show thousands of workers digging a massive complex. U.S. special \\nenvoy Charles Kartman said Thursday after the Pyongyang talks that \\nthere was ``compelling evidence'' of an underground nuclear facility. \\nBut in a statement distributed by the U.S. Embassy here Saturday, \\nKartman backtracked, saying instead that the United States lacks ``conclusive \\nevidence'' the site is a nuclear facility. ``There is strong information \\nthat makes us suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the \\nintended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if \\nso, what type of nuclear facility it might be,'' Kartman said, offering \\na ``clarification'' of his earlier remarks. Kim said his government \\nwould ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve \\nthe nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied the underground \\nconstruction site has any nuclear purpose, and it has demanded a dlrs \\n300 million payment for proving that. In remarks in Tokyo on Friday, \\nClinton rejected the idea of compensation. Directing his remarks at \\nNorth Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new tourism deal \\nthat is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise ships _ an arrangement \\ntouted by Kim as a sign the North may be opening up to its 1950s Korean \\nWar enemy. To risk that kind of cooperation _ and progress with America \\non other issues _ by stonewalling on the suspected nuclear site is \\ncontrary to the North's long-term interests, he said. ``Nothing could \\never be put into that hole in the ground, given our defense partnership \\nhere, nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that would \\ngive the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as much wealth, \\nas much happiness, as more of those ships going up there full of people \\nfrom here,'' Clinton said. To underscore the U.S. military commitment \\nto South Korea, Clinton was scheduled to venture out of the capital \\non Sunday to visit U.S. Army troops at a training range north of Seoul. \\nHe also planned to address American troops at Osan Air Base from a \\nU-2 spy plane hangar. \\n\\nPresident Clinton made an unusual, direct appeal to North Korea on \\nSaturday to set aside any nuclear ambitions in favor of strengthening \\nties to South Korea and the United States. The appeal came during \\na meeting with reporters at which he also counseled patience over \\nIraq's refusal to comply with a request from weapons inspectors. ``I \\nthink it's important that we not overreact here on the first day,'' \\nClinton said in response to reports that Iraq had balked at a request \\nby U.N. inspectors for documents on its weapons program. But, speaking \\nat a joint appearance with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton \\ncalled the requested documents ``quite important'' and said Iraq had \\n``some affirmative obligations'' to help weapons inspectors. Aides \\nto Clinton denied that his comments represented any softening toward \\nIraq. They said that because the situation was still developing and \\nthe president was preparing for meetings with Kim he had not been \\nbriefed in detail on Iraq's resistance when he appeared before reporters \\nSaturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the administration \\nwas consulting with other members of the U.N. Security Council about \\nthe matter. If Iraq fails to meet its obligations under U.N. resolutions, \\nhe said, ``We obviously are prepared to act.'' Last weekend, Clinton \\ncalled off a strike against Iraq minutes before it was to begin, delayed \\nhis departure for Asia to monitor the crisis and said that U.S. forces \\nremained poised to strike if Iraq reneged on its agreement to let \\nU.N. weapons inspectors do their work. In his appearance with Kim, \\nthe president addressed a handful of questions that ranged from North \\nKorea to Indonesia to whether the Congress should punish him over \\nthe Lewinsky scandal. Before leaving Washington for this five-day \\ntrip to Japan, Korea and Guam, he drew a parallel between the governments \\nof Iraq and North Korea, saying, ``We must be no less concerned by \\nNorth Korea's weapons activities.'' The Clinton administration is \\nurgently seeking to inspect a vast construction site in North Korea \\nthat it believes may be the beginnings of a nuclear weapons plant. \\nSaturday, Clinton called that site, together with North Korea's test \\nfiring in August of a missile over Japan, ``cause for deep concern.'' \\nBut the Clinton administration is trying a very different approach \\ntoward North Korea than toward Iraq, partly at the urging of Kim, \\nwho is pursuing a ``sunshine policy'' of engagement with the North. \\nAs Clinton and Kim delivered prepared statements and answered questions \\nSaturday, Clinton became most animated in describing what he called \\n``a very beautiful picture'' that he happened to spot after turning \\non his hotel television on arriving in Seoul on Friday night: film \\nof a cruise ship recently permitted to carry South Koreans on a tour \\ninto the North. ``I ask the North Koreans to think about this,'' he \\nsaid, arguing that Kim's policy of engagement with the North presented \\nthem with a great opportunity. ``Nothing could ever be put in that \\nhole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much advantage, \\nas much power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more of those \\nships going up there full of people from here.'' The Clinton administration \\nfears that the construction site may be evidence that North Korea \\nhas abandoned a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up its nuclear \\nweapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid. The North \\nKoreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear \\nweapons. But they have demanded that the United States pay $300 million \\nto inspect it, a request rejected this week by a U.S. delegation to \\nPyongyang, the North Korean capital. The new complex is being built \\non a mountainside about 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the former \\nNorth Korean nuclear research center. Kim continued Saturday to emphasize \\nhis hopes for a new opening toward North Korea. But he said, ``We \\nwill not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate \\nnuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.'' \\nThe Clinton administration plans to resume negotiating with North \\nKorea over inspecting the site in December. In addition to strategies \\nfor easing the Asian financial crisis, Clinton discussed North Korea \\nduring a visit to Tokyo on Thursday and Friday. The subject of North \\nKorea consumed most of his two hours of meetings with Kim here Saturday \\nat the Blue House, which contains the Korean president's office and \\nhome. The administration has been criticized in Congress and in this \\nregion for letting its policy on North Korea drift, but Clinton called \\nthat policy a ``clear-eyed mix'' of diplomacy and deterrence. He said \\nthat so far the 1994 agreement had worked, because without it ``North \\nKorea already would have produced a sizable amount of weapons-grade \\nplutonium.'' Under pressure from congressional critics, Clinton last \\nweek appointed William Perry, his former defense secretary, to review \\nhis policy on North Korea. On other matters, Clinton declined to criticize \\nthe government of Indonesia for using force to crack down on protesters \\nthere, saying that he did not ``have enough facts at this moment to \\ngive you the right answer.'' But he said he hoped there would be ``no \\nbacksliding'' in Indonesia. Clinton followed his appearance with Kim \\nwith a visit to the National Folk Museum here, where he conducted \\nan hourlong conversation with six Korean academics, businessmen and \\nunion leaders about the troubled state of Korea's economy and its \\nimpact on the society. He attended a state dinner Saturday night, \\nbefore stopping by a concert where his brother, Roger, a musician, \\nhappened to be performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim for \\nhis efforts at economic reform, noting that interest rates had fallen \\nhere and the currency had stabilized. But he also pressed Kim during \\ntheir private meetings to restructure the five huge conglomerates, \\nor chaebols, that account for some 40 percent of the Korean economy. \\nIn describing the leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring \\nthe chaebols ``perhaps the most serious remaining problem in the South \\nKorean economy.'' Clinton said during the economic forum Saturday \\nafternoon that he felt impatient about South Korea's failure to act \\non the chaebols. It may be necessary to proceed slowly with the restructuring, \\nhe said, ``but they should begin.'' On Sunday, Clinton plans to visit \\nsome of the 37,000 American troops stationed here. \\n\\nA South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be \\nproducing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear \\nfacilities than already feared. Without naming his source, Rep. Kim \\nDeog-ryong of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had \\n``information'' that two underground facilities captured on U.S. spy \\nsatellite photos may be nuclear plants. He said in a Parliament session \\nthat one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium and \\nthe other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting \\naround 2004. If true, the assertion paints a worse picture of suspected \\nNorth Korean nuclear activity than already made public. Kim said he \\nasked the government's Unification Ministry about the issue earlier \\nthis week and was suspicious of its answer. ``It was not sufficient \\nor sincere, so I came to suspect that the government is trying to \\nhide the truth,'' Kim said in a seven-page press release. U.S. and \\nSouth Korean officials said in August they had detected a huge underground \\nconstruction site on a mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast \\nof Yongbyon, the country's main nuclear complex. The United States \\nhas said it suspects the construction is nuclear-related, though it \\nhas no evidence. North Korea has denied it. Kim, a lawmaker from the \\nmain opposition Grand National Party, said there may actually be two \\nunderground facilities not far from the Yongbyon complex. It was activity \\nat Yongbyon that prompted the United States to negotiate a 1994 accord \\npromising development of two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments \\nif North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development. At the time, \\nNorth Korea was believed to have made enough plutonium for one or \\ntwo atomic bombs. The Yongbyon complex, which houses a 500-megawatt \\nlaboratory nuclear reactor, has been frozen under the 1994 accord. \\nKim said Friday that one new facility is already operating and the \\nother is under construction and will be operational in four to six \\nyears. ``We estimate that the reactor will go on-line in 2002 or 2003, \\nenabling the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear weapon \\nwithin six to 12 months,'' Kim said. ``North Korea would be able to \\nmake sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapons every \\nyear after that.'' North Korea has said the underground construction \\nis for civilian use and not nuclear-related. It has offered to open \\nthe facility to U.S. inspectors, but says Washington must pay compensation \\nif the facility is been proven to be for civilian use. \\n\\nIn a green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday \\nvisiting American troops stationed in South Korea. He promoted a private, \\nsang birthday greetings to a sergeant major and described the threats \\nto his hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea. ``Lately, signs \\nof danger have intensified,'' Clinton said in an address to airmen \\nhere, standing before a gunmetal gray F-16 and A-10 parked nose-to-nose. \\n``So we must remain vigilant. And thanks to you, we are.'' For all \\nhis eagerness to talk about information-age economic dangers like \\nquicksilver currency flows, Clinton has returned again and again during \\nhis five-day trip to Japan and South Korea to the old-style regional \\nmilitary threat posed by North Korea. The subject consumed most of \\nhis meetings with President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea on Saturday \\nand formed the backdrop for his visits with the troops Sunday. ``It's \\nkind of tense around here,'' said John Kelley, a 26-year-old airman \\nfrom Wisconsin, describing life on this base. ``You know you're only \\nfour minutes away from a missile.'' In his speech, Clinton pointed \\nto recent North Korean missile tests, incursions into the south and \\na mysterious underground site that may be a nuclear weapons installation \\nas signs of the potential threat. And he compared North Korea to Iraq, \\nsaying that North Korea was ``also a major concern'' because of its \\nchemical and biological weapons. Until North Korea ``fully commits \\nitself to a constructive role on this peninsula,'' he said, ``we must \\nremain ready.'' Clinton restated his support for Kim's policy of engagement \\nwith North Korea, though, saying that there were ``some hopeful signs'' \\nto justify it. He pointed to talks that began over the summer between \\nthe American military command in Korea and the North Korean military \\nto prevent problems along the demilitarized zone between the south \\nand north. Clinton planned to leave South Korea early Monday and return \\nto Washington Monday night, after paying a visit to Guam. On a bright \\nbut icy afternoon, Clinton was warmly received here by soldiers in \\ncamouflage and black boots, some of whom waited almost three hours, \\nshifting from foot to foot and rubbing their hands. The official crowd \\nestimate was only 3,500, but the turnout seemed even smaller. The \\nbase, about 30 miles south of Seoul, is one of two major American \\nairfields in Korea, housing 7,500 airmen. Others who wanted to see \\nthe president were bused in from sites that are hours away. Before \\nflying here by helicopter, Clinton attended church on an Army base \\nin Seoul, then visited a firing range just 12 miles from the demilitarized \\nzone. In a brief ceremony there, he promoted Matt Prickett of West \\nLiberty, Ohio, from private first class to specialist. And he led \\nthe troops in a round of ``Happy Birthday'' for Sgt. Maj. Charles \\nThomas of Wilson, N.C., who turned 45 on Sunday. ``It definitely caught \\nme off guard,'' Thomas said. \\n\\nNorth Korean news media on Thursday said the communist nation's military \\nis on full alert for war with the United States if a dispute over \\nnuclear inspections comes to blows. The North's official Korean Central \\nNews Agency reported that North Korean soldiers and people of all \\nwalks of life were ``on full alert for war.'' North Korea typically \\nsends out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enters high-stake \\ntalks with Washington. The United States and North Korea are set to \\nresume talks Friday about inspections of an underground North Korean \\nsite suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons. KCNA broadcasts \\nbrimmed with anti-American saber-rattling. ``Our People's Army will \\nblow up the U.S. territory as a whole'' if the United States starts \\na war on the divided Korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong \\nChang Ryol was quoted as saying Thursday. The general staff of the \\nNorth Korean military accused Washington on Wednesday of pushing the \\nsituation in Korea to the ``brink of war'' by demanding inspections \\nand talks aimed at preventing Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons \\nand long-range missiles. ``Under the prevailing touch-and-go situation, \\nthe Korean People's Army is now bracing itself for a fight against \\nthe U.S. imperialist aggressors,'' KCNA quoted Jong as saying. The \\nagency also quoted various party officials, plant managers, even museum \\ncurators as pledging a ``thousandfold revenge'' or vowing to arm themselves \\nwith the ``spirit of human bombs and of suicidal attack.'' Washington \\ndemands unconditional inspections of the North's underground project. \\nBut North Korea asked Washington to pay dlrs 300 million for the right \\nto inspect the site. Concerns that North Korea was developing long-range \\nmissiles capable of striking all of Japan and parts of the United \\nStates escalated when North Korea fired a rocket on Aug. 31. Believed \\nto be a test of its Taepo Dong missile, the rocket flew over Japan \\nand landed in the Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military \\nis the world's fifth largest. It forms the backbone of the North Korean \\ngovernment, with leader Kim Jong Il ruling the country as the head \\nof the military. \\n\\nNorth Korea has agreed to receive a U.S. delegation next month to \\ndiscuss American concerns about the construction of a vast underground \\ncomplex that is widely feared to house a nuclear weapons program, \\nthe State Department said on Wednesday. The delegation, led by Charles \\nKartman, will press for access to the site, which American intelligence \\nagencies believe could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a \\nfrozen nuclear arms program. ``We've made clear to the North Koreans \\nthat any attempt by North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development \\nprogram would be unacceptable,'' the State Department spokesman, James \\nRubin, said. The talks in Pyongyang, the capital, he added, ``are \\naimed at completely satisfying U.S. concerns about the suspect construction.'' \\nAmerican intelligence agencies fear that building the complex could \\nbe an effort to break out of a four-year-old pact in which North Korea \\npledged to give up its nuclear-weapons program in exchange for billions \\nof dollars in aid from the United States, South Korea and Japan. American \\nofficials have said spy satellites have recently photographed thousands \\nof North Koreans around the huge site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, \\nthe nuclear center where North Korea was believed to have stockpiled \\nenough plutonium before the 1994 accords to build six or more bombs. \\nAlthough they have not explained exactly why the government is building \\nthe complex, North Korean officials have denied that it would be used \\nto develop nuclear weapons. The official North Korean press agency \\nsaid last week that the government was building ``civilian underground \\nstructures on which any `doubt' cannot be cast'' and suggested that \\nAmerican officials would be allowed to inspect the complex if they \\npressed for access. ``If the U.S. side persists in inspecting our \\nunderground structures,'' the press agency said, ``we can show it \\nto them.'' Rubin said the United States had received no formal assurances \\nthat Kartman, the American special envoy for Korean nuclear issues, \\nand his delegation would be allowed to inspect the site on the trip, \\nwhich is to begin on Nov. 16. ``We are beginning a discussion with \\nthem in which we will demand access,'' Rubin said. ``The history of \\nthe U.S.-North Korea discussions involves usually a lengthy discussion \\nprocess before there is agreement to our requirements. So we are not \\nexpecting to walk in one day and be able to have access the next.'' \\nThe trip was announced as signs grow about a relative warming of relations \\nbetween the United States and North Korea. Representatives of the \\nUnited States, China and the two Koreas met recently in Geneva and \\nagreed to steps to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. In September \\nthe United States pledged to provide an additional 300,000 tons of \\ngrain to North Korea, which has for years been crippled by severe \\nfood shortages. In addition the White House disclosed that the United \\nStates would provide more heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea under \\nthe 1994 agreement, despite concerns that North Korea may intend to \\nrevive its nuclear program. American officials have said the activity \\nnear Yongbyon may not yet have technically violated the accord, because \\nthere is no evidence that North Korea has begun pouring cement for \\na new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to \\nbomb-grade plutonium. \\n\\nA congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said \\nSaturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and \\ndeteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved \\nto death in the last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, \\nwho has had a longtime interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo \\non his return to the United States and showed photographs he had taken \\nof North Korean children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open \\nsores and other signs of severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back \\na bag of what officials called ``substitute food'' being distributed \\nby a government food station: dried leaves and straw, so coarse that \\neven cattle would normally turn away. ``They grind it into powder \\nand make it into noodles,'' Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition \\nand are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomachs, \\nhe said. North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic \\ndifficulties, but there have been sharply diverging assessments of \\nhow serious these are. Some visitors with the United Nations and other \\norganizations have said that the food situation seems to be a bit \\nbetter now than a year or two ago. Hall said that the divergence might \\nhave arisen because in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life did \\nseem to be slightly better than during his three previous trips to \\nNorth Korea. But in rural areas where foreigners are not often allowed \\nto visit, he added, the overall situation is worse than ever. Based \\non visits to four hospitals, Hall also emphasized that public health \\ncare had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants were holding \\ndown a patient while surgeons conducted a stomach operation without \\nelectric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, \\nin part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienated \\nwould-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations has repeatedly \\nappealed for relief aid for North Korea, but the latest appeal has \\nraised less than one-third of the target. In September, Doctors Without \\nBorders announced that it was pulling its staff of 13 from North Korea \\nbecause it feared that its aid was going to the politically connected \\nrather than to the most needy. North Korea does not release mortality \\nfigures or health statistics, but Hall said that the United Nations \\nhad gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent \\nof North Korean children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and \\nthat 67 percent of all children are physically stunted. Hall said \\nhe thought that overall at least 1 million people had died and that \\nthe total was probably closer to 3 million. In an indication of the \\nseriousness with which professional demographers view the situation, \\nthe U.S. Bureau of the Census recently published estimates suggesting \\nthat North Korea's population peaked in 1995 at 21.55 million and \\nhas since fallen to 21.23 million this year. That would be a decline \\nof 320,000 over three years, a period when North Korea's population \\nwould have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people, based on \\nthe population growth rate of the early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, \\nan American specialist on North Korean population figures, says that \\nthere simply is not enough hard information for him to estimate the \\ndeath toll from the famine. But he notes one political tidbit: North \\nKorea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate \\nto the country's ``people's assembly'' for every 30,000 citizens. \\nThis year's assembly did not expand as previous ones did, but rather \\nhad just 687 delegates, the same as the previous assembly held in \\n1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North \\nKorea's population, after eight years in which it had been expected \\nto add several million people, is now back to 20.6 million people \\nor fewer. The United States has been supplying grain to North Korea, \\nbut strains are growing over a secret underground complex in the North \\nthat some experts worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapons \\nprogram. The United States warned last week that the ``agreed framework'' \\nthat is the basis for its relations with North Korea will be in jeopardy \\nunless the North lets American experts visit the underground complex \\nand resolve their doubts. North Korea has said that it will show off \\nthe complex only if Washington promises that if the complex is not \\na nuclear one, it will pay for ``vilifying us and impairing our prestige.'' \\nWashington refuses to pay, and North Korea is warning that the standoff \\ncould lead the agreement to fall apart. ``Their shameless and wicked \\ndemand is an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference \\nin our internal affairs,'' declared North Korea's leading newspaper, \\nRodong Sinmun. \\n\\nNorth Korea has demanded that the United States pay hundreds of millions \\nof dollars for the right to inspect a huge underground center that \\nU.S. intelligence analysts fear houses a nuclear-weapons program, \\nClinton administration officials said Wednesday. The United States \\nrejected the request during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North \\nKorean capital, between North Korean officials and a U.S. government \\ndelegation. ``As we expected, the North Koreans brought up the issue \\nof compensation, and we flatly rejected it,'' said State Department \\nSpokesman James Rubin. Asked how much money the North Koreans had \\ndemanded, Rubin said payment of the fee was ``so not on as a possibility \\nthat I don't care to get into the figures.'' Other administration \\nofficials said the fee would have been hundreds of millions of dollars; \\none put it at $300 million. The North Koreans have denied that the \\ncomplex, which is being built on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast \\nof Yongbyon, the former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended \\nto be used for a nuclear weapons program. They have repeatedly said \\nU.S. inspectors could visit the site as long as Washington agreed \\nto pay a large fee in compensation for what the North Koreans describe \\nas the administration's slander. The North Korean representative at \\nthe United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that the United \\nStates could inspect the site ``on condition that when it is confirmed \\nnot to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation \\nfor slandering and defaming my country.'' U.S. intelligence agencies \\nfear that by building the complex, North Korea may have decided to \\nabandon a four-year-old agreement with the United States in which \\nNorth Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange \\nfor billions of dollars in aid. The U.S. delegation, led by Charles \\nKartman, President Clinton's special envoy on North Korean issues, \\nleft Pyongyang on Wednesday after 12 hours of negotiations over three \\ndays with a team from the North Korean Foreign Ministry. The talks \\nended as Clinton began a trip to Asia that will include a visit to \\nSouth Korea, where the issue of the North Korean construction site \\nis expected to be among the major topics discussed with President \\nKim Dae-jung. Rubin said the U.S. delegation to North Korea had pressed \\nfor access to the site. ``We told them that access to the site is \\nessential,'' he said. ``We've expected that this would be difficult, \\nand we told the North Koreans, as we've said before, that verbal assurances, \\nas they are wont to give, are simply unacceptable.'' U.S. officials \\nhave said the construction of the underground site may not yet have \\ntechnically violated the accord, because there is no evidence that \\nNorth Korea has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing \\nplant to convert nuclear waste to bomb-grade plutonium. But if the \\nUnited States determines that North Korea has revived its nuclear \\nprogram, Rubin said, ``it would go against the entire letter and spirit \\nof the objectives of the agreement, and it would affect the viability \\nof the agreement.'' The administration has expressed growing concern \\nover North Korea's intentions after several provocative acts, including \\nthe underground construction near Yongbyon and the test firing last \\nAugust of a missile over Japan. Last week Clinton named former Defense \\nSecretary William Perry to review U.S. policy toward North Korea. \\nAdministration officials say Perry is being asked to study ways to \\nsalvage the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea, which had been \\namong the administration's proudest achievements in foreign policy. \\n\\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's \\nsupport Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear \\nsite, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander \\na chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula. President Kim \\nDae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged to \\n``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve the \\nnuclear question. He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at \\na North Korean underground facility and said the North must not develop \\nmissiles. On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held \\na roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions \\nfor putting the nation's economy back on track. Economics and security \\nare Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. \\nClinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet \\ncertain that the suspicious underground construction project in North \\nKorea is nuclear related. But he said the North risks closing the \\ndoor on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the site. On \\nthe first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held a roundtable \\ndiscussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for putting \\nthe nation's economy back on track. Economics and security are Clinton's \\ntwin themes on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. Clinton acknowledged \\nthat U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the underground \\nconstruction project in North Korea is nuclear related. But he said \\nthe North risks closing the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. \\ninspection of the site. ``It raises a strong suspicion,'' Clinton \\nsaid at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential \\nmansion overlooking the capital. ``We need access to it.'' The foundation \\nof U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward \\nthe South is a 1994 ``agreed framework'' in which the North halted \\nits nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western commitment to \\nbuild modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would be shattered \\nif the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project. \\nKim, who has moved South Korea to a ``sunshine'' policy of engaging \\nNorth Korea on cultural and economic fronts, was firm in saying his \\ngovernment supports Clinton on the nuclear issue. In meetings this \\nweek in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. officials were rebuffed \\nin their request to see the suspicious site, which American intelligence \\nofficials fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear \\nweapons program. ``We must require full access and ways to ascertain \\nthe nature and the purposes of the construction site,'' Kim said. \\n``If it is, in fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should \\ndemand immediate close down.'' He also said the North must limit its \\nmissile development, citing the ``great shock'' in Japan when the \\nNorth Koreans test-fired a missile its way Aug. 31. U.S. spy satellite \\nphotos show thousands of workers digging a massive complex. U.S. special \\nenvoy Charles Kartman on Friday retracted an assessment he made Thursday \\nthat there was ``compelling evidence'' that North Korea is building \\nan underground nuclear facility. In a statement distributed by the \\nU.S. embassy here today, Kartman said instead, ``There is strong information \\nthat makes us suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the \\nintended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if \\nso, what type of nuclear facility it might be.'' Kim said his government \\nwould support U.S. efforts to resolve the nuclear question. The North \\nKoreans have denied the underground construction site has any nuclear \\npurpose, and have proposed a dlrs 300 million payment for allowing \\ninspections. Clinton rejected the idea of compensation. Directing \\nhis remarks at North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new \\ntourism deal that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise \\nships _ an arrangement touted by Kim as a sign the North may be opening \\nup to its 1950s Korean War enemy. ``Nothing could ever be put into \\nthat hole in the ground, given our defense partnership here, that \\nwould give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as \\nmuch wealth, as much happiness, as more of those ships going up there \\nfull of people from here,'' Clinton said. In his meeting with Korean \\ncommunity and business leaders at Seoul's National Folklore Museum, \\nClinton praised South Korea's progress in recovering from its financial \\ncrisis. On a darker note, he mentioned recent tensions over Asian \\nsteel exports to the United States, which have skyrocketed this year \\nat great cost to the domestic U.S. steelmakers. Japanese steel is \\nthe biggest problem, but South Korean steel exports also are on the \\nrise. Clinton said the U.S. economy could tolerate increased imports \\n_ if they are not concentrated in just a few industries, and if the \\nresult is that the Asian economies begin to recover. ``We have to \\nbe sensitive if the price of doing that is to basically erase'' an \\nentire sector of the U.S. economy, Clinton said. \\n\\nThis city has always kept an unwritten list of foreign leaders _ dictators, \\nunfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoying allies _ who it \\nthinks can make an enormous contribution to peace, security or America's \\nagenda by taking early retirement, at a minimum. In the 1950s, the \\nleftist leaders of Iran and Guatamala made the Top 10, in the '60s \\nit was populated by Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President \\nRichard M. Nixon and his advisers infamously agreed at a secret meeting \\nin the '70s that the best way to deal with the government of Salvador \\nAllende Gossens in Chile was to ``make the economy scream.'' Diplomatic \\netiquette, though, has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies \\nlist from the White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy isn't \\nabout personalities, right? But last week, driven by frustration, \\nor anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the \\nClinton administration piped up, twice. In very different situations, \\nin opposite corners of the world, the United States spoke loudly because \\nit can't find a stick. Sunday, hours after he called off an attack \\non Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of \\nU.S. policy toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein \\n_ what Clinton called supporting the ``forces of change in Iraq.'' \\nNo matter that covert efforts to do just that have failed miserably. \\nThe bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used \\nhis visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to throw \\nU.S. support behind protesters calling for ``reformasi,'' the code \\nword on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister Mahathir \\nMohamed. He has long been a burr in Washington's side, denouncing \\nAmerica, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently imprisoned \\nhis Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who has suddenly \\nbecome Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir is no Saddam, \\nnot by a long shot. Gore's aides insist that his speech was a call \\nfor reform, not a demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted \\nthat way. The New Zealanders called it ``megaphone diplomacy.'' The \\nMalaysian government called it ``disgusting'' and an ``interference \\nin internal affairs.'' Predictably, executives of several U.S. companies \\nthat have flocked to Kuala Lumpur told the Malaysians that Gore was \\nrude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered words that needed \\nto be said. Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's words, they raised the \\nquestion of what it takes these days for the world's most powerful \\nnation to begin publicly suggesting that it's time for a nettlesome \\nleader to go. Because there is no official list, there are no real \\ncriteria for getting on it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, \\nlike Kim Jong Il of North Korea. President Clinton is spending the \\nweekend on the Korean Peninsula, staring across the demilitarized \\nzone at a dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to \\nbreak out of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects, \\nin return for billions in Western energy aid. Yet Washington has never \\ncalled on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's repressive \\nregime. His government, taking a page out of the Saddam playbook, \\nsuggested last week that if the United States really wants to look \\nat a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believes is a nuclear installation \\nin the making, it should write a check for another $300 million. No \\none even called for Kim's removal when, a few months ago, he lobbed \\na three-stage missile over Japan just to show he knew how. ``The rules \\nfor calling for the end of a regime are pretty murky,'' said Richard \\nFeinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego \\nwho served in the Clinton administration's first term. ``When they \\nreally want to push someone out, it is because that country is part \\nof a larger strategic concern at the time. But the country itself \\nusually doesn't have great strategic weight'' _ it's another matter \\nto call for a change of leadership in Beijing or Moscow _ ``and it \\nhelps if there is some kind of domestic opposition that we can point \\nto.'' Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely \\na ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid stockpiler \\nof anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who was President \\nGeorge Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week that Saddam \\nnowadays is simply ``an irritant, an annoyance, a pest and a problem, \\nbut not a threat to the region at the moment''). Mahathir, however, \\nis far more complex case. He's a prime example of how opposing Washington's \\npolitical and economic agenda for an interconnected world can move \\na leader from the list of authoritarians whom Washington tolerates \\nto the list of authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness. \\nLike other Asian strongmen _ Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and \\nSuharto of Indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear was \\nthat Malaysia would become a communist domino. But he also seemed \\neminently tolerable long after the Cold War was over. He has never \\nbeen accused of enormous corruption. He turned his country into a \\nmodel of competitiveness, and Malaysia became the exemplar of the \\n``big emerging markets'' that Clinton's Commerce Department touted \\nuntil things went sour last year. Sure, he was always prickly. But \\nhe is no terrorist or killer _ U.S. companies have flocked to his \\ncountry, and say they want to stay _ and his iron control over political \\ndiscourse is no stronger than in neighboring Singapore. Just this \\nsummer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid him an ostensibly \\nfriendly, if strained, visit and made no reference to human rights. \\nThat all changed when Ibrahim was arrested and beaten in jail. He \\nhas long been an advocate of the Western-style solutions to economic \\nturmoil _ more openness, more freedom _ and the protest movement against \\nMahathir only surfaced once he was in jail. Gore leapt on that opportunity \\n_ particularly striking because, in the case of Indonesia earlier \\nthis year, it took the administration months to come to the conclusion \\nthat President Suharto had to go. He went. \\n\", \"\\nEndeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of \\nthe international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story \\ntower in the shuttle cargo bay. It was the first time that the Russian-built \\nZarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever \\ntouched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. \\n``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the \\ntwo pieces came together. ``Congratulations to the crew of the good \\nship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control. ``That's terrific.'' The \\n240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy \\nCurrie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle \\nrobot arm. ``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said. Then came the hard \\npart: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. The two station \\npieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the \\nother with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her \\ncrewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, \\nrather than direct line of sight. This was the first time such a ``blind'' \\ndocking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned the solar-winged \\nZarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly \\nabove Unity. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. \\nOnce she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, \\nand the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for \\nthe docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. \\nThe historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. The union \\n_ intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime _ set the \\nstage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical \\nconnectors and cables between the two components. Mission Control \\nthought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned and gave \\nthe six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. But everything occurred \\nmore or less when and how it was supposed to, aside from a piece of \\nspace junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach \\nto Zarya, the six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket \\nlaunched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilots \\nto fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between \\nEndeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles \\nfrom the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been ``probably \\na little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said. The bigger \\nworry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, \\nand its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never \\nbefore handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, \\na power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on \\nNov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering \\nfor the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can \\nbe launched next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called \\ndown that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian \\nflight controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed \\nin order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't \\nbe needed before next summer, officials said. The only other problem \\nwas with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part. \\nThe 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, \\nwill serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. \\nIt was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be \\nconnected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking \\nastronauts to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks \\nare planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical \\nconnections between the two modules but to install handrails and other \\ntools for future crews. The joined modules will be released from Endeavour \\nonce all of the work is completed. NASA estimates 43 more launches \\nand 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble \\nthe entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station \\nwill have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, \\nand house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. \\n\\nThe planet's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle \\nEndeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built \\npart of an international space station that is expected to cost more \\nthan $100 billion. After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced \\na postponement early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 \\nFriday morning, right on schedule. The night sky was clear, and the \\nmoon full. With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly \\nturned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five minutes \\nand 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be seen \\nin the distance, twinkling like a new star. On their 12-day flight, \\nEndeavour's astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit, \\ngrasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new U.S. module. \\nWielding tools hundreds of miles above Earth, working methodically \\nin the cold void, the astronauts will be starting a five-year assembly \\nthat is likely to make the construction of the Pyramids and the great \\ncathedrals look like child's play. Construction of the station, which \\nwill be a research facility, will require an estimated 160 space walks, \\nwhich, for safety reasons, will always be done by two people. When \\ncomplete, the international space station, dominated by solar power \\narrays, will cover an area equal to that of two football fields. Modules \\nof interconnected laboratories and living quarters for up to seven \\nastronauts are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetliners. \\nThe station's batteries alone, if lined up, would extend a half-mile. \\nThe project entails high risk, because of the technical difficulty \\nof putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space, \\nalong with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the \\nconstruction site. The work is further complicated by international \\npolitics and worries about money. The Russians, whose participation \\nin the partnership clinched the post-Cold War deal five years ago, \\nare now a wild card. Moscow's economic and political woes have left \\nWestern officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up \\nwith its share of money and technology. At the same time, the station's \\ncosts are rising, and its critics among scientists worry that its \\nappetite for money will consume their own federal financing. The project's \\ntotal cost is a subject of debate, but the most credible estimates \\nnow put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's \\nestimated lifetime, at $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayers are \\nto spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign partners \\nabout $14 billion. The station is intended to be a grand laboratory \\nwhere, in the environment of weightlessness, investigators can develop \\nnew materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remaining mysteries, \\nin part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for long space \\nflight to other worlds. Friday, in any case, little was heard about \\nthe project but praise. ``Great show, Endeavour,'' mission control \\nin Houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into \\norbit. At the Florida spaceport, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \\nlauded the launching team and the new venture. ``That was truly, truly \\nfantastic,'' she told the team after the liftoff. And it was important, \\nshe added, to have so many nations ``working together on the kinds \\nof issues that the 21st century is going to be concerned with.'' ``So \\nmy congratulations to all of you,'' the secretary said. ``Stupendous \\nwork.'' The main cargo Thursday was the Unity module, the first U.S.-built \\nstation part. Small compared with the giants to come in three dozen \\nshuttle flights during assembly, the unit is 18 feet long, weighs \\n13 tons and is to serve as a connecting hub for other modules. Saturday, \\none of the astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army, is to have \\nthe shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure \\nit to Endeavour's docking system, moving the unit from a horizontal \\nto a vertical position. Then, Sunday, the astronauts are to rendezvous \\nwith the module known as Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched \\ninto orbit from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. Financed by the United States \\nbut built in Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, is be a kind of tugboat \\nfor the embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion as well \\nas communication and rendezvous abilities. When Endeavour's payload \\nbay is within 10 feet of Zarya, Colonel Currie is to reach out with \\nthe robot arm and pull the Russian module into position over Unity. \\nThe mechanical arm has never before moved anything so big. Zarya, \\nwhile completely weightless in space, has 21 tons of mass. If mishandled, \\nit can crush and kill. As Col. Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's \\ncommander, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three \\nspace flights, is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station \\npieces together. When mated with special attachments, Zarya and Unity \\nwill form the station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide \\nout to the tips of the solar arrays. Starting Monday, a pair of space-walking \\nastronauts are to hook up electrical connections and data cables between \\nthe units, attach antennas and install tools and handrails for future \\nvisitors. The builders will be Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force, 50, \\nand Dr. James Newman, 42, a physicist. Their series of three space \\nwalks will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction \\ngoes on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour will be busy making \\npreparations to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel \\nand docking system. Next Thursday, the crew will enter the embryonic \\nstation for the first time, installing portable fans and lights. Friday \\nthey will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next \\nmajor element, the first one both built and financed by Russia. The \\nother astronauts on Endeavour are its pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow \\nof the Marine Corps, and a mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev of \\nthe Russian Space Agency. After separating from the new outpost, the \\ncrew is to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on Dec. \\n15, with the mission length just shy of 12 days. Gretchen McClain, \\nNASA's director in Washington for the international space station, \\nsaid in an interview here that its overall costs were actually small \\nfor individual Americans. Over its lifetime, she said, the annual \\ncost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation's \\n96 million taxpayers. U.S. costs for construction, she added, were \\n$24 billion, and for operations through the year 2012 were $10.4 billion, \\nfor a total of $34.4 billion. Most experts outside the agency consider \\nthis figure ridiculously low because it ignores many billions of dollars \\nspent in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle \\nflights, which run about $800 million apiece. \\n\\nFor the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour \\non Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight. \\n``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana. ``Amen,'' replied \\na launch controller. Rain and cloudy skies were once again a threat. \\nBut NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would \\nbehave; it went off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday, \\nforcing a delay. NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch \\nEndeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which \\nwas put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians. The shuttle contains \\nthe second station component. The master alarm blared and red lights \\nflashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday. By \\nthe time controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic \\npressure and decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed \\nthe cutoff by a second or two. ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill \\nReaddy, shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander. \\n``But we do things right. We do things by the book, and we're not \\ngoing to cut any corners even if it means just shaving a second or \\ntwo.'' The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw \\nup their hands. Cabana held up his thumb and index finger a half-inch \\napart: ``We were that close.'' The problem was confined to one of \\nEndeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. The pressure dropped just \\nlong enough to trigger the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive \\nswitch, then returned to normal. NASA engineers spent the day examining \\nthe problem, but found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were \\nconfident it would not reoccur. Endeavour's flight is already a year \\nlate because of a cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in \\nbuilding the international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA \\nabout $600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour \\nis an American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronauts \\nwill use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station \\npiece and attach it to Unity. Then, two spacewalkers will hook up \\nall the electrical connections and cables between the two cylinders, \\nand attach handrails and tools for future crews. Until the alarm sounded, \\nit looked as though the weather would be the only problem. Rain and \\nclouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{ hours before liftoff, but drifted \\naway with minutes to spare. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \\nand other dignitaries from around the world had gathered in the drizzle \\nto see Endeavour and its crew off. ``Here we have 16 countries cooperating \\non a venture to the future,'' said Albright, who was expected back \\nfor Friday's attempt. ``This is a good investment.'' \\n\\nFollowing a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of \\nthe space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts on Sunday joined \\nthe first two of many segments that will form the international space \\nstation. The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya \\ncontrol module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing orbits \\nthroughout the day. Less than an hour after a rendezvous 240 miles \\nabove the Earth shortly before 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the \\nArmy deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylinder \\nas the craft passed above Russia and to slowly pull it toward the \\nshuttle. Seeing Zarya up close, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marines, \\nthe shuttle commander, confirmed that two antennas had failed to deploy \\nfrom the module following its launch from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. There \\nwere earlier indications that the antennas, which will be used later \\nby the station to manually assist spacecraft dockings, had not extended. \\nCurrie took almost two hours to painstakingly move Zarya above the \\nAmerican-made Unity docking port positioned in Endeavour's cargo bay. \\nWhen the two pieces were aligned within inches of one another, Cabana \\nfired small thruster rockets that raised the shuttle, allowing the \\nmodules to clamp together. The two station pieces, together measuring \\nabout 77 feet from end to end and having a combined mass of 70,000 \\npounds, are the first of 100 major components to be united in space \\nover the next five years to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh \\nalmost a million pounds and span an area the size of two football \\nfields. More than 40 additional missions by U.S. shuttles and Russian \\nrockets will be used to haul all of the components and other supplies \\ninto orbit, and astronauts from both nations are to spend almost 1,800 \\nhours doing spacewalks to assemble the entire structure. The spece \\nstation is expected to cost its partnership of 16 nations more than \\n$40 billion just to construct. Bringing the pieces together is only \\nthe first step in mating them. A pair of astronauts are to make three \\nspacewalks this week, the first on Monday, during which they will \\nhook up electrical and communications cables, remove covers, attach \\nhandrails and perform other tasks to get the modules to work as one \\nunit. The most difficult part of Sunday's mating of the $240 million \\nZarya to the $300 million Unity was bringing them together after the \\nshuttle caught up with the Russian unit. Currie had to use the Canadian-built \\nrobot arm to place Zarya on top of Unity without being able to see \\nwhere the pieces joined. Unity, raised in Endeavour's cargo bay on \\nSaturday, is so large that it blocked Currie's view of the mating \\nfixtures from the shuttle's windows. She used views from remote cameras \\nand a computerized vision system built on the arm to estimate the \\nrelative positions of the two large segments. The computerized system \\nexamined markings on both modules, computed their relationship to \\none another using the marks and displayed the results on a laptop \\ncomputer. ``We've never done anything like this before,'' Currie said \\nbefore the flight, adding that she had practiced the difficult maneuver \\nmore than 100 times over the last two years. The flight of Endeavour, \\nwhich took off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, had gone according \\nto plan until early Sunday, when mission control ordered the shuttle \\nto change its orbit slightly to avoid a piece of space debris. Air \\nForce space debris trackers noted that the shuttle was to pass within \\n1.6 miles of a spent stage of an American booster rocket launched \\nlast month. Although this was considered a safe distance, shuttle \\ncontrollers decided to widen the separation to five miles as an extra \\nprecaution. \\n\\nEndeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of \\nthe international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story \\ntower in the shuttle cargo bay. It was the first time that the Russian-built \\nZarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever \\ntouched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. \\n``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the \\nmoment the two pieces came together. ``Congratulations to the crew \\nof the good ship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control. ``That's terrific.'' \\nThe 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy \\nCurrie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle \\nrobot arm. ``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said. Then came the hard \\npart: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. The two station \\npieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the \\nother with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her \\ncrewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, \\nrather than direct line of sight. This was the first time such a ``blind'' \\ndocking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned the solar-winged \\nZarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly \\nabove Unity. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. \\nOnce she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, \\nand the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for \\nthe docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. \\nThe historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. The union \\n_ intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime _ set the \\nstage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical \\nconnectors and cables between the two components. Mission Control \\nthought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned and gave \\nthe six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. But everything occurred \\nmore or less when and how it was supposed to, aside from a piece of \\nspace junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach \\nto Zarya, the six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket \\nlaunched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilots \\nto fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between \\nEndeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles \\nfrom the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been ``probably \\na little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said. The bigger \\nworry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, \\nand its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never \\nbefore handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, \\na power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on \\nNov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering \\nfor the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can \\nbe launched next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called \\ndown that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian \\nflight controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed \\nin order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't \\nbe needed before next summer, officials said. The only other problem \\nwas with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part. \\nThe 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, \\nwill serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. \\nIt was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be \\nconnected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking \\nastronauts to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks \\nare planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical \\nconnections between the two modules but to install handrails and other \\ntools for future crews. The joined modules will be released from Endeavour \\nonce all of the work is completed. NASA estimates 43 more launches \\nand 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble \\nthe entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station \\nwill have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, \\nand house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. \\n\\nEndeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of \\nthe international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story \\ntower in the shuttle cargo bay.

While \\nputting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station \\nwould make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old \\noutpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, \\nsaid Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA was \\nsurprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed \\nthe orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch \\nof the first part of the new station. Delaying the Nov. 20 flight \\nby 10 hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in \\nthe subsequent assembly flights, and resulted in potentially unfavorable \\nsun angles on the solar-powered station, engineers said. ``We have \\nmutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes,'' \\nBrinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center \\nin Houston. ``It added technical complexity and risks to the mission \\nthat were not justified.'' The decision, which followed ``frank and \\ncandid'' discussions between the two partners, was not imposed by \\nthe United States, he said. ``The conclusions were mutual,'' Brinkley \\nsaid. ``Both sides concluded that it did not make sense.'' The Russians, \\nstruggling to find money for their space program with their nation \\nin economic collapse, had said they wanted to transfer thousands of \\npounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an \\neconomy move. However, some critics questioned the Russians' motives, \\nwondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay \\nthe decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have \\nagreed to do next summer. The Russians have so little money that the \\nUnited States and other partners in the international station fear \\nthat money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations \\nwith the new project. ``The Mir competes with the international space \\nstation for very critical resources and for funding,'' Brinkley said. \\nNASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment to \\nuse on the international space station, he said, but only if it does \\nnot interfere with assembling the new station. The United States and \\n15 other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next \\nweek when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and \\npropulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period. \\nThe space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second \\nstation part, a U.S.-built connecting passageway that attaches to \\nthe first module. \\n\\nEndeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first \\npiece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control \\nmodule that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. \\nStacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered \\nthe most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to Nancy Currie, \\nthe shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned \\nUnity in the cargo bay on Saturday. The two station pieces are so \\nbig _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined \\nmass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates were going to \\nhave to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather \\nthan direct line of sight. Such a ``blind'' docking had never been \\nattempted before. Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time \\nfor the tasks. ``The main thing I've tried to do for the last two \\nyears working on this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin \\non everything,'' said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning \\ntheir final approach to Zarya _ Russian for Sunrise _ the shuttle's \\nsix astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched \\nlast month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilots to \\nfire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour \\nand the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the \\norbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little \\ntoo close for comfort,'' Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by \\nfar, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling \\nwith Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been \\nassigned to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya, \\na power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on \\nNov. 20. It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering \\nfor the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can \\nbe launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve \\nas a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. In case \\nZarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking \\nastronauts would have to manually fit them together. The astronauts \\nwould be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and \\ncables between the two components. In all, three spacewalks were planned \\nfor Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimates 43 more launches and \\n159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble \\nthe entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station \\nwill have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, \\nand house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. \\n\\nA last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the \\nspace shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international \\nspace station. Another attempt for Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts \\nis scheduled for Friday at 3:36 a.m. This was the first time in three \\nyears, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after \\nthe spaceship was fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to \\ngo. The uncommon delay prompted frowns and furrowed brows here, although \\nofficials stressed that it was entirely warranted. ``We want to err \\non the conservative side,'' Ralph Roe, launch director at the Kennedy \\nSpace Center, said at a news conference after the sudden halt of the \\ncountdown just 19 seconds before liftoff. Everything had been going \\nsmoothly for a rare nighttime launching, set for 3:58 on Thursday \\nmorning. The weather, forecast to be iffy, turned out to be fine, \\nand the sky was alight with a nearly full moon. But the length of \\nthe so-called launching window was, as planned, unusually short _ \\nonly 10 minutes. That brevity was a result of Endeavour's having to \\nrendezvous with a space-station part that Russia put into orbit last \\nmonth. The show-stopper arose about four minutes before liftoff when \\nthe computer in the space shuttle set off a master alarm. Controllers \\nstudied the data and discovered a momentary pressure drop on one of \\nthe hydraulic systems that control the movements of the shuttle's \\nengines and its rudder and other flight surfaces. Officials eventually \\ndecided that the pressure drop was insignificant, and they resolved \\nto press ahead. But by then it was too late: time had run out for \\none of the procedures needed to keep the shuttle's fuel supercold. \\nSo the countdown was aborted just 19 seconds from blastoff. The six \\nastronauts began to emerge from the shuttle an hour later and ultimately \\nheaded for bed to rest up for another attempt early Friday. \\n\", \"\\nA North Korean man arrived in Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum after \\nescaping his hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said. \\nKim Myong Sup, 23, had been living in hiding in a ``third country'' \\nsince fleeing North Korea last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs \\nand Trade said. The ministry generally uses the term ``third country'' \\nto avoid naming China, which is required by treaty with North Korea \\nto return defectors to their homeland. The ministry described Kim \\nas a former athlete, but said details of his background and his method \\nof escape from North Korea were not available. About 200 North Koreans \\nhave defected to South Korea in the past three years, including 60 \\nso far this year. All complained about severe food and fuel shortages \\nin their country. The Koreas were divided into the communist North \\nand the capitalist South in 1945. They fought the Korean War in 1950-53 \\nand never signed a formal peace treaty. \\n\\nA congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said \\nSaturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and \\ndeteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved \\nto death in the last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, \\nwho has had a longtime interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo \\non his return to the United States and showed photographs he had taken \\nof North Korean children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open \\nsores and other signs of severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back \\na bag of what officials called ``substitute food'' being distributed \\nby a government food station: dried leaves and straw, so coarse that \\neven cattle would normally turn away. ``They grind it into powder \\nand make it into noodles,'' Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition \\nand are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomachs, \\nhe said. North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic \\ndifficulties, but there have been sharply diverging assessments of \\nhow serious these are. Some visitors with the United Nations and other \\norganizations have said that the food situation seems to be a bit \\nbetter now than a year or two ago. Hall said that the divergence might \\nhave arisen because in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life did \\nseem to be slightly better than during his three previous trips to \\nNorth Korea. But in rural areas where foreigners are not often allowed \\nto visit, he added, the overall situation is worse than ever. Based \\non visits to four hospitals, Hall also emphasized that public health \\ncare had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants were holding \\ndown a patient while surgeons conducted a stomach operation without \\nelectric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, \\nin part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienated \\nwould-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations has repeatedly \\nappealed for relief aid for North Korea, but the latest appeal has \\nraised less than one-third of the target. In September, Doctors Without \\nBorders announced that it was pulling its staff of 13 from North Korea \\nbecause it feared that its aid was going to the politically connected \\nrather than to the most needy. North Korea does not release mortality \\nfigures or health statistics, but Hall said that the United Nations \\nhad gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent \\nof North Korean children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and \\nthat 67 percent of all children are physically stunted. Hall said \\nhe thought that overall at least 1 million people had died and that \\nthe total was probably closer to 3 million. In an indication of the \\nseriousness with which professional demographers view the situation, \\nthe U.S. Bureau of the Census recently published estimates suggesting \\nthat North Korea's population peaked in 1995 at 21.55 million and \\nhas since fallen to 21.23 million this year. That would be a decline \\nof 320,000 over three years, a period when North Korea's population \\nwould have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people, based on \\nthe population growth rate of the early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, \\nan American specialist on North Korean population figures, says that \\nthere simply is not enough hard information for him to estimate the \\ndeath toll from the famine. But he notes one political tidbit: North \\nKorea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate \\nto the country's ``people's assembly'' for every 30,000 citizens. \\nThis year's assembly did not expand as previous ones did, but rather \\nhad just 687 delegates, the same as the previous assembly held in \\n1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North \\nKorea's population, after eight years in which it had been expected \\nto add several million people, is now back to 20.6 million people \\nor fewer. The United States has been supplying grain to North Korea, \\nbut strains are growing over a secret underground complex in the North \\nthat some experts worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapons \\nprogram. The United States warned last week that the ``agreed framework'' \\nthat is the basis for its relations with North Korea will be in jeopardy \\nunless the North lets American experts visit the underground complex \\nand resolve their doubts. North Korea has said that it will show off \\nthe complex only if Washington promises that if the complex is not \\na nuclear one, it will pay for ``vilifying us and impairing our prestige.'' \\nWashington refuses to pay, and North Korea is warning that the standoff \\ncould lead the agreement to fall apart. ``Their shameless and wicked \\ndemand is an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference \\nin our internal affairs,'' declared North Korea's leading newspaper, \\nRodong Sinmun. \\n\\nFamine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year \\nthan last and could be worse, a senior U.N. aid official said Saturday. \\nNorth Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain \\nto feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just \\n2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program \\nsaid. Although hard figures are not yet available, the prospects for \\nthis year are that ``the harvest will not be any better,'' Ngongi \\ntold reporters in Beijing after visiting North Korea. ``It may be \\nworse than last year.'' Poor harvests, economic collapse and three \\nyears of floods and drought, have produced chronic food shortages \\nin North Korea and left it heavily reliant on foreign aid. Fertilizer \\nis lacking, as is fuel to power tractors and farm machinery, meaning \\nmost planting and harvesting must be done by hand. ``Every year it \\ngets worse,'' Ngongi said. But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi \\nsaid the government about a month ago cut the number of counties to \\nwhich the WFP has access from 171 to 145, reducing the number of people \\nwho can get aid from 6.7 million to 5.8 million. Most of those receiving \\nWFP aid are children aged between 6 months and 6 years. Ngongi said \\nthe government cited security concerns _ notably the lack of a peace \\ntreaty with its rival South Korea _ for its decision. The government \\nsaid the ban would be temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, who spent four \\ndays inspecting WFP relief efforts in North Korea, said people generally \\nlooked better than during a visit last year. But he also said he could \\nsee that ``a large part of the population is very weak.'' ``Everybody \\nhas been consuming at a very low level. So they may not be severely \\nmalnourished, but they are not well nourished at all,'' he said. U.S. \\nofficials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of North Korea \\nthis summer said 2 million people may have died because of famine. \\nNgongi said he saw malnourished children who were said to be 10 or \\n11 years old, but appeared to be only 4 or 5 years old. About 30 percent \\nof children in one primary school he visited were not in class. ``A \\nlot of the children were too weak to come to school,'' he said. But \\nNgongi said foreign food aid has saved lives. ``A lot of people are \\nalive today thanks to the international community's support,'' he \\nsaid. \\n\\nMore than five years of severe food shortages and a near-total breakdown \\nin the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in \\nNorth Korea and probably left an entire generation of children physically \\nand mentally impaired, a new study by international aid groups has \\nfound. The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North \\nKorea, confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers, \\nwho over the past year have gained increasing access to the population \\nof this highly isolated and secretive country. Among other shocking \\nfindings, researchers from the World Food Program, Unicef and the \\nEuropean Union found that, because of long-term food shortages, a \\nstaggering 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunted \\ngrowth. They have discovered that, despite a huge international food \\naid program over the past three years, severe malnutrition is widespread \\namong toddlers at crucial stages of brain development, suggesting \\nthat this generation's physical and mental abilities will not develop \\nnormally and that the losses can never be recovered. Separately, international \\nmedical workers from groups like the Red Cross, have begun to document \\nhow the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by \\na breakdown in public health services. Even basic water purification \\nsystems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine, \\nRed Cross workers say, leaving vast numbers of people with such severe \\ndiarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food \\nthey have. As the North Korean dictatorship has slowly, often grudgingly, \\ngranted increased access to international aid groups in the last six \\nmonths, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger \\nhaas emerged as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys \\nand observations by foreign aid agencies. Past assessments of the \\nmagnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million are considered \\nflawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of \\nNorth Korean refugees who had fled into China. And while the researchers \\nand aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence \\nof cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside _ descriptions \\nthat have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports _ what they did \\nfind was in many ways equally disturbing: A population withering after \\nnearly a decade of chronic hunger, people so weakened by malnutrition \\nthat colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation \\nirretrievably lost. ``Now at last we have hard facts _ the situation \\nis very grave,'' said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for \\nAsia of the World Food Program, which has taken part in the research. \\n``To me this is a famine in slow motion. People cope year after year, \\nand probably a lot drop off. But the totality is very hard to gauge.'' \\nFor three weeks this fall, crews led by foreign scientists were finally \\npermitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random \\nsample nutritional survey of children, providing by far the most solid \\ndata on the crisis. They found that 62 percent of children under 7 \\nhad stunted growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent \\nof 1-year-olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition. This \\nmeans a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development, \\nbecause the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential \\nfirst year. The researchers said that available scientific data suggest \\nthat 10 years ago, malnutrition was rare in North Korea. ``Even if \\nthe situation improves, it is unlikely to improve to the degree that \\nthe country will fully recover from what we saw,'' said Judit Katona-Apte, \\na senior program adviser for the World Food Program. ``People will \\nbe small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited \\nin their mental capacities.'' Likewise, when Red Cross representatives \\nthis year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics \\nwhere they operate, they found that not one had water that was suitable \\nfor human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head of the Red Cross delegation \\nin North Korea. ``But of course they drink it _ they have no choice,'' \\nhe said during a recent trip to Beijing. ``There is a very close relationship \\nbetween the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector \\nthat's in very bad shape.'' Virtually all the children under 7 who \\nare malnourished also have diarrhea, he said. None of the aid groups \\nhas been able to study the issue of hunger-related deaths, and the \\nNorth Koreans have not released relevant figures, although most experts \\nagree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three \\nmillion have died prematurely since the food shortages began. But \\npublic health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult \\nto tally in any case, because most deaths were probably not from quick \\nstarvation, but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger, so \\nthat common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an \\nordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal. Still, there are \\nsome disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted by the World \\nFood Program and other groups last year on 4,000 children hand-picked \\nby the government, 10 percent had a parent who was dead. In this fall's \\nindependent nutritional survey, 18 teams of experts sent to eight \\nof North Korea's nine provinces looked at 1,800 rural and urban children \\nunder seven. In addition to finding that 62 percent of children had \\nstunted growth, the teams found that about 16 percent of children \\nwere suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their \\nheight, a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the \\nstudy. That figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and \\nputs North Korea among the world's worst 10 countries in terms of \\nmalnutrition. While that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as \\nthat of India and Bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18 percent \\nmalnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number in some ways \\nunderstates the problem. In India and Bangladesh, pockets of severe \\npoverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty, while in North \\nKorea the whole country is to some degree underfed. ``Even in war-torn \\ncountries, famine is more in pockets,'' Dr. Katona-Apte said. ``It's \\nhard to think of another country that's been affected in this way.'' \\nThe survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied \\nonly children under 7, the group that received nearly all the food \\ndonated from abroad. After three years of food donations, many foreign \\naid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries \\nand kindergartens are looking better _ but that their older siblings \\nare failing. So a month ago, the World Food Program began providing \\nelementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged \\n7 to 12. ``We have reason to believe that many people are suffering \\nand that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting \\nweaker and weaker,'' Swedlund said. There are now more than 100 Westerners \\nliving in Pyongyang, the capital city, and many say the long-term \\nhunger is readily apparent there. ``If you walk down the street in \\nPyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you are usually off by three \\nyears,'' Swedlund said. ``She may be 7 but she looks just 3 or 4.'' \\nDr. Katona-Apte, a nutrition expert who has worked in Bangladesh and \\nthe Sudan, said she was shocked when she first visited a North Korean \\nkindergarten last year. ``There were these two children sitting at \\na desk who were obviously severely malnourished _ they were so thin \\nand they had patchy hair,'' she said. ``And they were just sitting \\nthere working. This is accepted as normal! They are in school, and \\nthey should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation. \\nIf you saw them in a refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention.'' \\nBut with a severely depleted public health and hospital system, that \\noption does not exist, she and others said. Many Korean doctors do \\nnot know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it before \\nthis decade. And, in any case, the hospitals lack the food and proper \\nnutritional supplements. Swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines, \\nhad no glass to replace broken windows and were ``colder inside than \\nout,'' having received no coal since 1994. He said that even in hospitals, \\nsanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent, \\nbecause the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run \\nwater pumps. He said that next year, the Red Cross would start to \\naddress those problems, spending $3.5 on food for hospital patients \\nand $1 million on water treatment. With few other options, vast numbers \\nof North Koreans have resorted to eating ``substitute food,'' hard \\ncakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants, like soybeans \\nand sweet potatoes, combined with indigestible filler, like cornstalks \\nand straw. ``This now constitutes 40 percent of food intake,'' Swedlund \\nsaid. ``It's becoming a regular part of the food basket.'' Doctors \\nin North Korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eating \\nthis partly indigestible material, he said, but added, ``If you're \\nvery hungry, it fills your stomach.'' Although the North Koreans date \\ntheir food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990's, \\nthe foreign researchers who have worked in North Korea say medical \\nrecords and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began \\nseveral years before that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet \\nUnion, which had long been North Korea's main supplier of food, fuel \\nand fertilizer. North Korea is a mountainous country, with less than \\n20 percent arable land. It has been a food importer for decades, mostly \\nfrom the former Soviet Union, but also from China. ``The country has \\nto come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem \\nand can't just be blamed on the weather anymore,'' Ms. Cheng-Hopkins \\nsaid. Still, she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive \\ngovernment for slowly loosening its restrictions. Swedlund said that \\nafter three years in the country, the international Red Cross, which \\ncollaborates with the North Korean Red Cross, had found officials \\nincreasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical \\nrecords and bring up problems. Travel is still restricted. There are \\nmore than 100 counties, home to 30 percent of the population, to which \\naid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to \\nprovide food or medical supplies. Still, the number of counties open \\nto the workers has increased steadily, and freedom to move about has \\nimproved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said about half of follow-up inspections \\nwere now unannounced, and she noted that the researchers in the nutritional \\nsurvey were allowed to select villages to visit and enter homes at \\nrandom. Workers from the Red Cross and the World Food Program said \\nthey had not observed extreme scenes of people dying of acute starvation \\nand believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently. \\n``I have not seen acute starvation like I have seen in Bangladesh,'' \\nDr. Katona-Apte said. ``But that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're \\nstill really limited in what we can see.'' Swedlund said it was unlikely \\nthat the counties still closed to foreigners were markedly different \\nfrom the open ones. And while some have surmised that the closed counties \\nmight harbor pockets of death and devastation, he said he accepted \\nNorth Korea's explanation that they had been excluded from some areas \\nfor national security reasons. ``One thing I've learned is how important \\nnational security issues are to the North Koreans,'' said Swedlund, \\na retired admiral in the Swedish Navy. ``And I really think these \\nareas are important from that standpoint,'' he added, going through \\na map of closed areas and describing what Western intelligence experts \\nknow about military installations there. He also rejected the notion \\nthat the North Korean military is stealing donated food, a charge \\nleveled by the organization Doctors Without Borders, when it angrily \\npulled out of North Korea last summer to protest the many restrictions \\non groups working there. Now that aid groups say they are starting \\nto get somewhat better cooperation from the North Koreans, they hope \\nto repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months. And they are \\nstill analyzing some tantalizing findings: Boys were twice as likely \\nto suffer from stunted growth as girls, and every child whose mother \\nwas dead was malnourished. ``A generation of North Korean children \\nis already scarred for life,'' said Astrid Heiberg, president of the \\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, \\nin an interview in Beijing after a trip to North Korea. ``We need \\nto continue to mobilize resources to prevent an even greater catastrophe.'' \\n\\nNorth Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages \\nwith its people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable \\nillnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday. The officials \\nwarned against international complacency and hostility toward North \\nKorea as the food crisis stretches on and the isolated communist country \\nshows little willingness to adopt far-reaching changes to revive its \\nruined economy. ``Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any \\npart of the world,'' said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary \\nof disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday after a week inspecting \\nthe aid agency's operations in North Korea. She and other Red Cross \\nofficials saw further ravages of North Korea's slow-motion famine: \\nelectricity supplied to only half the capital, Pyongyang, at a time; \\nthe elderly looking swollen, a sign of long-term hunger; a generation \\nof children stunted, with 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds and \\n5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. Everywhere, from bakeries to government \\nministries, people were being served noodles and cakes made from soybeans \\nmixed with acorns, grass and herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg \\nsaid. Heiberg likened the additives to ``cattle food'' and noted that \\ndoctors reported a rise in stomach illnesses from the mixtures. ``This \\nis really part of the daily life,'' she said. ``You would not give \\nthem to your children or your elderly mother knowing she would get \\ncramps in her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach was moaning.'' \\nThree years of floods and drought that started in 1995 devastated \\nNorth Korea's collective farming and planned economy, already teetering \\nfrom the loss of its Soviet bloc trading partners. With few goods \\nor money to barter or buy foreign supplies, the country lacks sufficient \\nfertilizer for crops, and fuel and parts for machinery. The Red Cross \\ninspectors saw soldiers and people harvesting cabbage, the winter's \\nmain vegetable. The grain harvest is finished and by U.N. estimates \\nlittle improved over last year's: about 3 million tons, only enough \\nto meet two-thirds of the needs of North Korea's 22 million people. \\nAs the long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm and official statistics \\nshow widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis on the rise and hunger-weakened \\npatients unable to recover from operations and sickness, Heiberg said. \\nDoctors worry that the respiratory illnesses so common in the winter \\nmay ``take a toll'' on the weakened population, she said. One 10-bed \\nhospital in the countryside was keeping only three patients at a time \\nbecause it did not have food to care for more, said Heiberg. The Red \\nCross wants to focus its latest dlrs 9 million appeal on getting essential \\nmedicines and blankets and warm clothes to North Korea. Food aid is \\nlargely being turned over to U.N. agencies. \\n\\nYears of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of North \\nKorean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering \\nmalnourishment, U.N. experts said Wednesday. Several years of flooding \\nand droughts coupled with an economic downturn have heavily damaged \\nNorth Korea's crop production and capacity to import food in the closed, \\ncommunist nation. A survey carried out in September and October also \\nshowed that 16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished, \\nwith a body weight too low for their height. That figure, which reflects \\nongoing shortages, is exceeded in Asia only by Bangladesh, India and \\nSri Lanka. Eighteen teams, each headed by a foreign official from \\nthe World Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund or the European Union, \\ncarried out the study. They measured the weight and height of 1,800 \\nNorth Korean children from infants up to age seven in homes randomly \\nselected in areas where aid agencies have access. Those areas cover \\naround 70 percent of the population. It was the first ``technically \\nsound survey'' of the problem, UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporters. \\nThe most alarming findings were for toddlers aged one to two, 30 percent \\nof whom were acutely malnourished. At that age, ``malnutrition can \\npermanently impair physical and intellectual growth,'' said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, \\nWFP director for the region. Children in North Korea's three largest \\ncities _ Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampo _ were better off than their \\ncounterparts elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished. Boys \\nwere almost twice as badly affected as girls. \\n\\nDespite catastrophic hunger at home, North Korea plans to send 317 \\nathletes and officials to next month's Asian Games in Thailand, South \\nKorean officials said Thursday. It will be the largest sports delegation \\nthe communist country has sent abroad in recent years. North Korean \\nSports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes from his country will \\ncompete in 21 events in Bangkok, hoping to win medals in women's judo, \\nwomen's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing. \\nChang made the remarks in an interview published recently by the Chosun \\nShinbo, a newspaper run by pro-North Korean residents in Japan, said \\nSeoul's Naewoe Press, which obtained the report. Chang said North \\nKorea was sending a large delegation to Bangkok to prepare for the \\n2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea did not enter the last Asian Games, \\nin Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. It sent only 18 athletes and officials \\nto the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in February. Naewoe is run \\nby South Korea's main government intelligence agency and specializes \\nin monitoring communist news media. Three years of floods and drought \\nthat started in 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and \\nplanned economy, forcing the country to rely on outside aid to feed \\nits 23 million people. \\n\\nHunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable \\nto the effects of famine in North Korea, a U.N. World Food Program \\nrepresentative said Tuesday. Though North Korea is suffering from \\na simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with \\nweak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition \\nin children, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director. ``There \\nis enough rice. The problem is that people are too poor to access \\nit. The problem is poverty,'' Davies said. The WFP is currently supporting \\n1.7 million hungry Cambodians _ about 15 percent of the population \\n_ with food-for-work and direct assistance programs, but Davies said \\nhe fears there are still plenty more that are not getting enough to \\neat every day. ``The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse \\nin North Korea,'' Davies said. ``The situation is much worse than \\nmost people recognize.'' According to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent \\nof Cambodian children under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and \\n20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. By comparison, a similar \\nsurvey of North Korean children under 7 found that 65 percent are \\nstunted and 16 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. Cambodia has \\nproduced a rice surplus for export in the last two years and expects \\nanother this year, but WFP statistics show that 25 percent of rice-growing \\nareas account for 75 percent of the surplus. The majority of Cambodian \\nfarmers are not producing enough to keep their families fed and are \\nbeing increasingly saddled with debts incurred when they run out of \\nreserves before harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders in rural Cambodia \\ntypically charge 100 percent interest, which must be paid in rice \\nat harvest time, giving many farmers a handicapped start on the next \\ncrop season. Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of \\nmodern child rearing _ problems left mostly unaddressed by under-funded \\nhealth and education sectors in Cambodia _ have exacerbated the food \\nsecurity problem, Davies said. Davies urged the new government to \\nsubstantially increase annual expenditures on health, education and \\nrural development as a first step in a long-term solution to Cambodia's \\nfood crisis. ``The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation \\nwith the malnutrition of children is a crisis,'' Davies said. Cambodia \\ntypically earmarks about half of its annual budget to defense and \\nsecurity. In the 1998 budget, education was allocated 6.5 percent, \\nhealth 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursements \\nto the three ministries are often only 60 to 70 percent of the budgeted \\namount as annual revenues fall short of expectations, according to \\naid workers. A 1999 budget draft proposed a reduction of the health \\nministry's allotment, which caused an outcry in September from health \\nofficials and the U.N. World Health Program. The draft was later readjusted \\nto provide an unprecedented 33 percent increase in health spending. \\n\\nThe founder of South Korea's largest conglomerate plans to visit his \\nnative North Korea again next week with a gift of 501 cattle, company \\nofficials said Thursday. The visit has been delayed a month because \\nof a dispute over 500 cattle donated by Chung Ju-yung, founder of \\nthe Hyundai group, during a trip to the North in June. North Korea \\nclaimed 71 of those cattle died because Seoul government agents force-fed \\nthem indigestible vinyl strips and lumps of rope before shipping them \\nto the North. Calling the North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry \\nof National Unification ordered Hyundai to check thousands of other \\ncattle being raised at its ranch on the west coast. The ministry later \\nacknowledged that lumps of rope were found in the stomachs of some \\ncattle on the ranch, but said the material didn't kill the animals \\ndonated to North Korea. It blamed the deaths on stress caused by the \\nlong shipment by truck to the North. The South Korean government said \\nit would not authorize a second shipment of cattle unless the North \\nretracted its accusations. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister \\nKang In-duk said North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week, saying \\nthat ``the misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue \\nof the dead cattle is cleared.'' Kang said the North's letter ``cleared \\na stumbling block for Hyundai's additional cattle donation.'' During \\nhis visit, Chung is expected to reach agreement on details of Hyundai's \\nplan to start sightseeing tours of a scenic mountain in the North. \\nThe tours, originally scheduled to begin in September, have been delayed \\nbecause of cost, security and other matters. Hyundai hopes to send \\nby ship up to 2,000 tourists a week for four-day tours of Diamond \\nMountain on the North's east coast beginning in November. Animosity \\nand distrust between the two Koreas run deep. The Korean states were \\nseparated into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. \\nThey fought a three-year war in the early 1950s. \\n\\nPolice in northeastern China's Jilin province said Monday they had \\nrounded up at least 100 North Koreans and sent them back to endure \\na famine in their reclusive country. A police official in the Jilin \\ncity of Tonghua, near the North Korean border, said the North Koreans \\nwere forced to repatriate because some had resettled illegally in \\nChina, had formed criminal gangs or engaged in prostitution. The official, \\nwho spoke on condition of anonymity, denied reports in the South Korean \\npress that the Chinese had disregarded requests for political asylum \\nin forcing the refugees back across the border. He said they had crossed \\ninto China seeking food, not because of political repression in North \\nKorea. Citing a North Korean human rights group and Japanese tourists \\nvisiting the region, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Monday \\nthat 150 North Koreans had been sent home from China, despite having \\npresented petitions for political asylum. North Korea is entering \\nits fourth winter of chronic food shortages, having harvested only \\n3 million tons of grain this year, about two-thirds of the minimum \\nneeded by its 23 million people. \\n\", \"\\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President \\nHafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey. \\nMubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to reporters. \\nBut Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied him on the \\ntrip, said before their departure that Mubarak ``backs dialogue for \\nsolving disputes and not military power and threats.'' Egypt's Middle \\nEast News Agency quoted Moussa as saying that Arab support for Syria \\nshould not be read in Ankara as animosity toward Turkey. The agency \\nalso quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa as saying that \\nEgypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness of the situation and that \\nit should be dealt with diplomatically and not through confrontation \\nor threats.'' Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey would \\nachieve results. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak was expected \\nin Ankara, possibly on Monday. The talks in Damascus came as Turkey \\nhas massed forces near the border with Syria after threatening to \\neradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the neighboring country. In a show \\nof force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian frontier, a Turkish \\ndaily reported. Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to Riyadh on \\nSaturday to get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for his mediation \\nefforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million people, \\nfrequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes. ``We have to \\nstop the tension and contain it, and military threats should stop,'' \\nMubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday. ``I am ready to exert \\nevery effort in this direction in Damascus and Ankara.'' Moussa said \\nMubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with Assad and also conveyed \\na message to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador \\nto Egypt, Yasser Yakis. Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering \\nKurdish rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy \\nfor the Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey. Syria denies sheltering \\nKurdish fighters. Late last week, Turkey sent 10,000 troops into northern \\nIraq to hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising. For its \\npart, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with \\nIsrael that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining \\nposition in peace talks with the Jewish state. Damascus also accuses \\nTurkey of building a series of dams on the Euphrates River that threaten \\nto reduce Syria's water supply. Editorials in the Arab world called \\non both sides to show restraint. In Baghdad, the newspaper Babil, \\npublished by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai, reported the \\nTurkish incursion into Iraq. ``The region cannot bear another conflict \\nnor an increase in the present tensions,'' Babil said in an editorial. \\n``The Turkish buildup does not serve anybody as much as it will harm \\nTurkey and Syria and other parties in the region.'' The English-language \\nEgyptian Gazette said in an editorial on Sunday that ``the Syrians, \\nunderstandably, harbor the belief that Turkey is being manipulated \\nby its new-found ally, Israel, to pounce,'' with the dispute over \\nKurdish rebels being a pretext. Israel, for its part, said it does \\nnot want to become involved in any military confrontation between \\nSyria and Turkey. ``We have no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime \\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. \\n``We have taken steps to reassure Syria.'' \\n\\nGreece on Monday warned that mounting tension between Turkey and Syria \\ncould lead to ``tragic results'' if not dealt with in its early stages. \\n``Sources of tension are being created in our region,'' government \\nspokesman Dimitris Reppas said. ``We will have to deal with these \\nsources from their birth, because they may develop out of control \\nand we will be led to tragic results.'' Greece accused Turkey of undermining \\nthe whole region's stability through its stand-off with Syria over \\nthe alleged harboring of Kurdish rebels. ``Sadly, the tone of certain \\ncountries is not constructive,'' Reppas said. ``Turkey in particular \\n... repeatedly dynamites every effort'' for the creation of a climate \\nof regional stability. Turkish troops have reportedly massed on the \\nfrontier with Syria, while Ankara has indicated its readiness for \\ncross-border raids to eradicate what it claims are guerrilla bases \\nharboring Kurdish rebels. Syria has denied the charge. In the past, \\nTurkish officials have also accused Greece of harboring Kurdish rebels \\nand running guerrilla training camps. Athens denied the charge, and \\nno evidence has been found to support the accusations. Relations between \\nGreece and neighboring Turkey are rarely cordial. The two NATO allies \\nare at odds over a variety of issues, and have twice reached the brink \\nof war in the past 11 years over the Aegean Sea. But as neighbors, \\ncountries in the region must learn to get along, Reppas stressed. \\n``No one can change geographical facts,'' he said. ``As we live in \\nthis region of the world ... we have to strive for good friendly relations \\nand cooperation.'' \\n\\nTurkey has sent 10,000 troops to its southeastern border with Syria \\namid growing tensions between the two neighbors, newspapers reported \\nThursday. The daily Milliyet quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw \\nconvoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer (375-mile) \\nborder; the daily Cumhuriyet said around 10,000 troops were being \\ndeployed. Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin denied any troop movement \\nalong the border, but said Turkey's patience was running out. President \\nSuleyman Demirel was harsher during parliament's opening session Thursday. \\n``I declare to the world that we retain our right to counter Syria, \\nwhich has not given up its hostile attitude despite all our warnings \\nand peaceful approaches,'' he said. Turkey accuses Syria of harboring \\nTurkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast; \\nit says rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan lives in Damascus. Relations \\nare also strained by the growing military and diplomatic ties between \\nTurkey and Israel, which Damascus claims destabilizes the region. \\n\\nLebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed \\nIsrael for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey. President \\nElias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit meeting with \\nPresident Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for Syria. He called \\nfor a ``diplomatic dialogue'' to defuse the tension, said Assad's \\nspokesman Jubran Kourieh. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country \\nbacks Syria in the dispute, which was triggered Sunday when Turkish \\nPresident Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that his country would \\nnot allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria \\ndenied the allegation. Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, \\nprompting fears of an attack. The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated \\nSunday hat Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled \\nBekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah \\nOcalan's Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps. Lebanese Foreign \\nMinister Faris Bweiz denied Monday that Kurdish rebels were based \\nin his country. ``The Turkish authorities fully know that measures \\nhad been taken in Syria and Lebanon more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop \\nthe activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz said at a news conference. \\nOcalan in recent years was believed to shuttle between the Bekaa Valley \\nand neighboring Syria. ``We stand by Syria's side, especially in its \\ncall for resolving disputes with Turkey in the framework of a peaceful \\ndialogue,'' the Lebanese prime minister said in an interview with \\nAn-Nahar daily. Hariri said Turkey's military moves were the product \\nof its newly forged military alliance with Israel. ``The Turkish threats \\nare the first outcome of the Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance,'' \\nHariri was quoted as saying. The Lebanese press also accused Israel \\nof inflaming the tensions. ``It is brilliant Israeli intelligence \\nversus absolute Turkish folly,'' wrote Talal Salman, publisher of \\nthe leftist newspaper As-Safir. Israeli officials had no immediate \\ncomment because it is the Sukkot holiday and all government offices \\nare closed. Since the Syrian-Turkish crisis began, Israeli defense \\nminister Yitzhak Mordechai has said Israel is not a party to it and \\nthat the Israeli-Turkish military coooperation is not directed against \\nany third state. Meanwhile, Syria's Assad received messages of support \\nfrom Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz and from the leaders \\nof Yemen and Sudan, said Syria's official news agency, SANA. The Arab \\nleaders called for diplomatic solution to the crisis. \\n\\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President \\nHafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey. \\nMubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to reporters. \\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said before their departure that \\nMubarak ``backs dialogue for solving disputes and not military power \\nand threats.'' Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying \\nthat Arab support for Syria should not be read in Ankara as animosity \\ntoward Turkey. The agency also quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq \\nal-Sharaa as saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness \\nof the situation and that it should be dealt with diplomatically and \\nnot through confrontation or threats.'' Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's \\ntrip to Turkey would achieve results. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said \\nMubarak was expected in Ankara, possibly on Monday. The talks in Damascus \\ncame as Turkey has massed forces near the border with Syria after \\nthreatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the neighboring country. \\nIn a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian frontier, \\na Turkish daily reported. Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to \\nRiyadh on Saturday to get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for \\nhis mediation efforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with \\n60 million people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes. \\n``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military threats \\nshould stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday. ``I am \\nready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus and Ankara.'' \\nMoussa said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with Assad \\nand also conveyed a message to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel \\nthrough Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser Yakis. Turkey long has \\naccused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting \\nsince 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish population in southeastern \\nTurkey. Syria denies sheltering Kurdish fighters. Late last week, \\nTurkey sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq to hit bases that Turkish \\nKurds use for their uprising. For its part, Syria has accused Turkey \\nof forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security \\nand undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the \\nJewish state. Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of \\ndams on the Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water \\nsupply. Editorials in the Arab world called on both sides to show \\nrestraint. In Baghdad, the newspaper Babil, published by Iraqi leader \\nSaddam Hussein's son Odai, reported the Turkish incursion into Iraq. \\n``The region cannot bear another conflict nor an increase in the present \\ntensions,'' Babil said in an editorial. ``The Turkish buildup does \\nnot serve anybody as much as it will harm Turkey and Syria and other \\nparties in the region.'' The English-language Egyptian Gazette said \\nin an editorial on Sunday that ``the Syrians, understandably, harbor \\nthe belief that Turkey is being manipulated by its new-found ally, \\nIsrael, to pounce,'' with the dispute over Kurdish rebels being a \\npretext. Israel, for its part, said it does not want to become involved \\nin any military confrontation between Syria and Turkey. ``We have \\nno part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \\ntold reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. ``We have taken steps to reassure \\nSyria.'' \\n\\nAs Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against Damascus, Egypt on Sunday \\nbegan shuttle democracy between the two neighbors to avoid a military \\nconfrontation over Turkish Kurdish bases in Syria. Turkish President \\nSuleyman Demirel said that Turkey was in a position of self-defense \\nand had suffered for many years from Damascus' sheltering of the autonomy-seeking \\nrebels. Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the \\nTurkish-Syrian border, news reports said. Damascus denies that it \\nis supporting the rebels, who wage cross-border raids from camps in \\nIraq, Iran and Syria. ``This situation is serious,'' Demirel said. \\n``I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world. This cannot \\ncontinue.'' He did not elaborate and it was unclear whether Demirel \\nwas warning of a possible military confrontation. But several military \\nand civilian leaders here have said that if diplomacy fails, the military \\nwould be charged with solving the issue. ``Our patience has run out. \\nWe are determined to take all necessary measures if we don't see any \\nresponse to our goodwill,'' the commander of Turkish land forces, \\nGen. Atilla Ates, said last week. Milliyet daily speculated Sunday \\nthat Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled \\nBekaa valley of Lebanon, where Turkey says the rebels have bases. \\nAnother report claimed the Turkish army had been put on alert. But \\nDefense Minister Ismet Sezgin insisted Sunday that war was the last \\nresort. ``I don't believe it will come to that,'' he said. The war \\nin Turkey's southeast waged by rebels seeking autonomy for the country's \\nlarge Kurdish minority, has killed some 37,000 people since 1984. \\nIn an attempt to the ease tension that many fear may spill over into \\nthe entire Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with \\nhis Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad in Damascus. Egypt's Middle East \\nNews Agency quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa as saying \\nthat Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness of the situation and \\nthat it should be dealt with diplomatically and not through confrontation \\nor threats.'' Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey this \\nweek would be fruitful. Jordan, which cautioned Syria and Turkey to \\ntake into consideration the higher interests of the region, offered \\nto mediate. Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and \\nIsrael's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the \\nties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus again \\naccused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria. ``We have \\nno part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \\nsaid Sunday. ``We have taken steps to reassure Syria.'' Israel has \\nalso instructed its army to limit military maneuvers along its border \\nwith Syria to avoid giving any impression that Israel is poised to \\nact. On Sunday, the Arab League called on Turkey to end its military \\ncooperation with Israel. Syria and Turkey have a long history of disagreements. \\nDamascus is concerned by Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates \\nRiver, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey accuses Syria \\nof having aspirations over a Turkish border province, Hatay, which \\nhas a sizable Arab population. \\n\\nIran has offered to mediate between Syria and Turkey in the deepening \\ndispute over Kurdish rebel bases and plans to dispatch envoys to the \\ntwo countries, the Tehran Times reported Monday.

You resign!'' at Speaker-elect Robert Livingston \\nwhen he called from the House floor for President Clinton to quit \\nthe White House in the face of certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, \\nLivingston did just that. He quit in one breathtaking utterance, as \\nif flicking a trump card onto the heap of impeachment angst festering \\nbefore his eyes in the debating chamber. In his one and only strategem \\nin leading his fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck \\nCongress like a verbal bomb. Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized \\nupon the instant. They had to stand, almost staggering to their feet, \\nto join the Republicans in a prolonged, emotional ovation for Livingston \\nand his undeniable self-sacrifice. As they stood, the Democrats sensed \\nLivingston had most suddenly closed a trap on the president and his \\ndefenders. For, with the impeachment issue set to move to the Senate, \\nLivingston, whose own marital indiscretions were now before the public \\nto his obvious misery, chose to show how the question of a political \\nleader's resignation was very much in play in this tumult-tossed city. \\n``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow,'' \\nLivingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the impeachment \\ndebate and the nation watching beyond. Livingston walked off the floor \\nlike the sheriff in some bullet-pocked political ``High Noon,'' discarding \\nthe leadership badge he had wrested from the earlier speaker-casualty, \\nNewt Gingrich. In the corridor just beyond, a doorman shouted to a \\npolice officer: ``Livingston just resigned!'' ``What? What?'' came \\nthe reply from the officer, who obviously thought the momentous announcement \\nwould be about Clinton's impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation. \\nJust so, the Democrats, already deep into bone-raw exhaustion after \\ntheir long fight to save the president, grasped for bearings. ``It \\nis a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism!'' declared Rep. \\nJerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a leading presidential defender trying to \\nrally Democrats around the argument that Livingston should not resign \\nany more than President Clinton should quit under fire. But the Republicans \\nwere surging to the fore on the strength of Livingston's announcement, \\nfighting tears as they rose to salute him as the ultimate political \\nrole model in the grueling impeachment process as it roared into the \\nfinal minutes of debate. ``For some it is no longer good enough to \\nmake a mistake, to confirm that mistake and take the consequences \\nof that mistake,'' said Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, his hands \\nshaking, his eyes tearing as he addressed the House and sought to \\ndrive the example of Livingston all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue. \\n``He understood what this debate was all about _ honor, duty, integrity \\nand the truth,'' said DeLay arguing that in one swift blow, Livingston \\nhad demonstrated himself to have been a far better speaker than Clinton \\nhas been a president. With something of the political elan the president \\nshowed in initiating the Iraq attack as his own impeachment loomed, \\nHouse Republicans, battered in public opinion polls, had found a rocket's \\nred glare of their own. ``I have hurt you all deeply and beg your \\nforgiveness,'' Livingston told the House, the nation and his family \\nas he announced retreat. Only moments before, Democrats openly hissed \\nthe man as Livingston firmly read his own judgment upon the president: \\n``Sir, you have done great damage to this nation over the past year.'' \\nPresidential resignation was in order, he continued, and then came \\nthe shouts of ``You resign! You resign!'' And as Livingston closed \\nthe circle on his career, he stunned the place into a collective breath \\nof disbelief and somehow almost threatened to reduce the dark historic \\nissue before the House _ the impeachment of the president _ into a \\nmatter of anticlimax. ``They must not succeed,'' David Bonior, the \\nDemocratic whip said of the Republicans as he was given the task of \\nrefocusing the day on the misdeeds of the president, not the departure \\nof the speaker. ``We are here to debate impeachment and should not \\nbe distracted from that,'' he declared. ``The only way we can stop \\nthis vicious cycle,'' Bonior cried out from the floor, ``is if we \\nrefuse to give into it, whether it is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston.'' \\nBut the House was still reeling through the frenzied day as the fateful \\nvote on the presidency approached and the notion of resignation licked \\nabout the capital city like a flame in a forest. \\n\\nIt has gotten to the point where drastic action may be necessary. \\nYou know those movies about Ebola virus outbreaks, where the guys \\nin sterile suits come in, seal off the area and completely irradiate \\nit? They may have to do that to Washington. Just eradicate us and \\nstart from scratch. In a few, short days we have managed to make the \\nterms ``surreal,'' ``bizarre,'' ``split-screen America,'' ``shocking,'' \\n``runaway train'' and ``politics of personal destruction'' useless \\ncliches. We no longer govern here. We just roll around in the gutter \\nwondering who's next in this sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, \\nwe had the surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image of Bob Livingston, \\nthe speaker-elect, stepping down after his marital infidelities were \\nrevealed. ``We are all pawns on the chessboard,'' Livingston said, \\nbefore asking the president to resign and then resigning himself. \\nLivingston's rabid pursuit of the president, even as he hoped to hide \\nhis own dirty laundry, made him an avatar of hypocrisy in a capital \\nrotting with hypocrisy. On Thursday night, when Livingston first confessed \\nhis sins to Republicans in hopes of keeping his hold on his post, \\nhis colleagues gave him a standing ovation. And after he made his \\nsurprise announcement Saturday, the Republicans gave him another ovation \\nand stepped up to deliver encomiums to their lost speaker. ``One's \\nself-esteem gets utterly crushed at times like this,'' sighed Henry \\nHyde, another tormenter of the president who also had to admit that \\nhe had succumbed to temptation. Tom DeLay, the jagged-edge exterminator \\nwho may next-up in the speaker roundelay, was choked up, praising \\nthe greatness of Livingston for understanding that this was ``a debate \\nabout relativism versus absolute truth.'' What could be more relative \\nthan a Republican who has hidden a lot of affairs trying to impeach \\na president for lying about his? Spurred by Larry Flynt's bounty for \\nsinnuendo, the city was braced for more craziness. The Ship of Fools \\nreached cruising speed on Friday evening, when we had the frightening \\nscene of Republicans so crazed with hatred of the president that they \\nwere railroading through an impeachment even though the United States \\nwas at war with Iraq, even though the House chamber was mostly empty, \\neven though Republicans were huddled in a glass house on the issue \\nof sex and lies, and even though the White House was still pitching \\na tent and planning sleigh rides for a Winter Wonderland press party \\non Monday. (The White House was keeping the journalists quarantined \\noutside this year, but encouraged them to bring their kids. To soak \\nup some of that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt. Why are the Republicans \\nso obsessed, when everyone in his right mind agrees that impeachment \\nis an outlandishly over-the-top punishment for Clinton and a self-destructive \\ncourse for the country? Because they genuinely hate the president. \\nThey think he's a dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child \\nof the '60s. They don't think they're going to pay a political price \\nfor this, and if they do, they don't care. It might be a great time \\nto see a lot of combovers, but it's not a great time to see a lot \\nof stature. The House debate was not history. It was just a more hideous \\nversion of ``The McLaughlin Group.'' While Republicans tried to draw \\nthe distinction that Clinton had perjured himself, they ignored that \\nthe president had been lured by the Starr-Jones attorney team into \\ntestifying on Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry for \\nLivingston. But the Republicans have brought this sexual doomsday \\nmachine on themselves by focusing so single-mindedly on Clinton's \\nsex life. The Republicans were so determined to do their high-tech \\nlynching that they engaged in wacky role reversals. Many Republican \\nhawks argued that Bill Clinton should not be bombing Saddam, claiming \\nthe timing was suspicious, even though they had hammered him for not \\nbombing five weeks ago. In an incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, \\nthe majority leader, and former Bush national security adviser Brent \\nScowcroft and Bush Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed \\nin on the attack. There's too much hate here. And I hate it. \\n\\nHouse Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of \\nshock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday \\nnight as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican \\ncolleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past. \\n``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals \\nworking together with the media who are investigating my personal \\nbackground in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable \\nagainst me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on \\nimpeachment,'' Livingston declared in a statement after appearing \\nbefore a shocked House Republican conference to head off the disclosure \\nas it surfaced in news reports. After hearing his admissions in a \\nclosed session, Livingston's colleagues gave him a standing ovation \\nof support and said the question of his resigning had never arisen. \\n``My fate is in your hands,'' Livingston told the Republicans, according \\nto lawmakers who were present. The debate over the president's fate \\nwould go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions \\nbetween the speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity \\nscandal that has put Clinton on the brink of impeachment. The president \\nis charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of \\npower in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions. Democrats offered \\nno immediate comment, but Republicans were braced to hear Livingston's \\nadmissions alluded to in the debate Friday by Democrats who have decried \\nthe investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair \\nrummaging through his sex life. Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual \\ncounseling and had received the forgiveness of his family, noted he \\nhad several times told reporters during his campaign to become speaker \\nthat ``I was running for speaker, not sainthood.'' He added, ``There \\nwas a reason for those words.'' ``During my 33-year marriage to my \\nwife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing \\nso nearly cost me my marriage and family,'' Livingston said in his \\nbrief prepared statement. But he attempted to draw a contrast with \\nthe allegations against the president, asserting: ``I want to assure \\neveryone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff \\nand I have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'' The \\ndisclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed \\nin ``Rollcall,'' a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new jolt of uncertainty \\namong lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous debate over the \\npresident's admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be \\nimpeached and tried by the Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican \\nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is to bring the impeachment \\ncharges against the president, previously was cited by a magazine \\nfor an extra-marital affair in his past. Then, as on Thursday night, \\nRepublicans voiced suspicions that Democratic defenders of the president \\ninstigated media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's \\nprincipal accusers. But no proof was offered as Republicans left their \\nconference, facing the uncertainties of a debate that already promised \\nto be bare-knuckled in its partisanship. Livingston left the conference \\nsurrounded by Capitol police, not taking questions from waiting reporters. \\nHis chief leadership aides immediately rallied in support. ``Some \\nwho would rather not struggle with this constitutional question continue \\nto try to twist the debate into an unseemly investigation of private \\nlives,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, the Republican majority leader. In \\nits report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall did not disclose \\nits source but made an oblique reference to Hustler, the sex magazine. \\nLarry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year advertised an \\noffer of a $1 million bounty for information about e of members of \\nCongress guilty of sexual indiscretions. ``It breaks your heart because \\nwe're all subject to human frailties,'' said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., \\nas he left the conference. ``This is not a comfortable circumstance \\nfor anyone,'' he added, insisting the president and the speaker-elect \\npresented two separate issues. ``We've got a duty to do under the \\nConstitution.'' \\n\\n``We are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted from \\nthat,'' the minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, \\nsaid during Saturday's House debate, in what leaped out as an impossible \\ngoal. It would have taken a kaleidoscopic television screen to capture \\nthe constantly shifting images competing for center stage: impeachment, \\nIraq, the resignation of Rep. Robert Livingston, the response from \\nthe White House. The months leading up to the impeachment of President \\nClinton had become a series of televised anticlimaxes, but the hours \\nbefore the vote made up for that lack of drama. There were hardly \\nenough shorthand terms or split screens to cover the activity. All \\nthe networks and cable channels carried the moment that unexpectedly \\nset the tone, as Livingston, a Louisiana Republican, announced during \\nthe debate that he would not become House speaker. The commentators \\nhad been set to carry the congressional ratification of the inevitable \\nvote, but suddenly the most plugged-in reporters were caught off guard. \\nAs Tim Russert said to Tom Brokaw on NBC, ``Tom, knock us all over.'' \\nIn the echo chamber that television news so often becomes, the shared \\nmantra had been weightier in early morning. ``For only the second \\ntime in American history'' a president would be impeached, went the \\nstandard line. Yet despite all the pundits speculating and politicians \\ntelegraphing every move, no one had hinted at the Livingston resignation. \\nThe announcement was, as Brokaw put it, at least partly ``a political \\nploy,'' and the repercussions were immediate. Reporters began gathering \\nword from Capitol Hill about candidates for the speaker's job, and \\nthe conversation moved to the next stage of the political tug of war. \\nThe Republicans used Livingston's resignation to say that the president \\nshould resign, too; the Democrats immediately countered with the idea \\nthat the president would stay and that Livingston should as well. \\nThat led to one of the less-expected split screens of the day, and \\nit was not a bad choice. While Congress was debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft \\nfire in Baghdad in one box. In the other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's \\npress secretary, stood in the White House driveway telling reporters \\nthat the president would like Livingston to reconsider his decision. \\nThere was more stateliness in the House than television usually offers, \\nand one reason was purely visual. ``Keep in mind that we do not control \\nthe picture,'' Dan Rather said on CBS, explaining that the television \\ncameras in Congress are provided by the House, not the individual \\nnetworks. There was no way to roam and zoom in for reaction shots, \\nas at a political convention. But the sense of history and decorum \\ndidn't last long at CBS. At noon, before the vote, CBS went to a football \\ngame, becoming the only network to leave the news coverage. CBS' corporate \\ndecision to try to have it both ways meant that Rather would break \\nin with updates from Washington. ``I'll see you very soon,'' he said \\nas he signed off the complete coverage, looking like a trouper. But \\nhe was in a position no news anchor should have been in on this day. \\nHe later announced impeachment votes on a split screen with the football \\ngame in progress in the upper part of the screen. On the other networks \\nand cable channels, the vote itself literally happened in the background. \\nAs TV screens toted up the numbers of the electronically-cast vote, \\nmembers of Congress milled around and chatted on the floor. Even the \\nbrief Democratic walkout after a motion to consider censure was defeated \\nwas thoroughly forecast. As the Democrats straggled down the steps \\nof Congress, it looked curiously undramatic on television, though \\nit probably made a better still photograph once they were all in place. \\nAnd while the votes were in progress, the jockeying for the speaker's \\njob heated up. ``We already have a presumptive leader,'' Gwen Ifill \\nof NBC News said in midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., \\nwho had also been cited by the other networks as a likely candidate. \\nIf the political and military action had not intruded, it might have \\nbeen more obvious that the debate on the House floor sent a message \\nabout vast divisions in politics and morality, signaling how deep \\na cultural fissure this crisis has opened. The impeachment, said Rep. \\nTom DeLay, R-Texas, was ``a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth.'' \\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contended that Congress had lost the \\n``distinction between sins and crimes,'' and argued against the ``sexual \\nMcCarthyism'' that has become prominent. And against the backdrop \\nof the revelations of adultery that led to Livingston's resignation, \\nRep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, declared ``the politics of \\npersonal destruction has to end.'' But as all the jabbering and political \\nposturing continued, as reporters raced to cover the president's statement \\nabout the impeachment and the latest briefings from the Pentagon, \\nthere was little time to focus on the profound cultural message beneath \\nthose rhetorical flourishes. \\n\\nRep. Bob Livingston, who confessed to his colleagues Thursday night \\nthat he had had adulterous affairs, stunned the House chamber Saturday \\nmorning by saying in the impeachment debate on President Clinton that \\nhe would not serve as speaker and would quit Congress in six months. \\nHe urged the president to follow his example and quit, too. But at \\nthe White House, where calls for Clinton's resignation are derided \\nas a Republican strategy, the president sent a spokesman into the \\ndriveway to urge Livingston to reconsider his resignation. Livingston \\nstood in the well of the House he has served for two decades and called \\non Clinton to resign his office rather than force a trial in the Senate, \\ndrawing boos from his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit \\ninstead. He then did just that. ``I must set the example that I hope \\nPresident Clinton will follow,'' Livingston announced to a shocked \\nand silent chamber in an act that left the Republican Party in total \\nchaos just hours before the vote to impeach Clinton. The decision \\nalso left the party leaderless on the eve of the opening of the 106th \\nCongress, when Republicans must govern with one of the narrowest majorities \\nin history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, \\nthe majority whip, somberly welcomed the news, suggesting it relieved \\nthem of an excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, \\nDeLay said, ``He understood what this debate was all about _ it's \\nabout honor and decency and integrity and the truth, everything we \\nhonor in this country.'' But Democrats said they were aghast, and \\nmany _ including Clinton _ called on Livingston to reconsider his \\ndecision. ``Mr. Livingston's resignation was wrong,'' declared Rep. \\nJerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``It is a surrender to a developing sexual \\nMcCarthyism. Are we going to have a new test if someone wants to run \\nfor public office _ are you now or have you ever been an adulterer?'' \\nHe called on the country to distinguish between sins and crimes. White \\nHouse press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton was ``disappointed'' \\nat the news of Livingston's plans and wished that he would reconsider. \\nLockhart said the president ``firmly believes that the politics of \\npersonal destruction in this town and this country has to come to \\nan end.'' He reaffirmed that Clinton would not resign, saying: ``The \\npresident is going to do what's in the best interest of the country. \\nIt would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal \\ndestruction.'' Livingston's announced resignation was all the more \\nstunning for its disclosure in a process that could result in the \\npresident's removal from office. The speaker is second in line to \\nthe presidency, after the vice president. Newt Gingrich, the outgoing \\nspeaker, who was driven from the post after Republicans lost five \\nseats in the November election, technically remains speaker until \\nJan. 6, when Livingston's election was to be ratified by the new Congress. \\nBut Gingrich has removed himself from the daily operations of the \\nHouse at this extraordinary session and has begun to dismantle his \\noffice. Livingston's decision was said to be driven in part by the \\nanger of a group of about a dozen conservatives in his party who were \\ndisillusioned that he had withheld news of his affairs from them. \\nThey had threatened to withhold their votes for him in the election \\nin January that would formally make him speaker. He was also concerned \\nabout the pain caused to his family by further disclosures, some members \\nsaid. They added that, not lost on many in his party, was the example \\nhe would set for the president by offering to resign his post now. \\nDeLay, No. 3 in the House Republican leadership, is expected to fill \\nthe power vacuum at least temporarily, in deed if not in title, while \\nthe party regroups to find a new speaker. Many members quickly rallied \\naround Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Hastert, one of DeLay's deputy \\nwhips who is well respected among his colleagues, had been promoted \\nas a candidate for majority leader last month, but never mounted a \\ncampaign. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas only precariously held on to his \\nmajority-leader post last month and was not considered a likely candidate \\nfor speaker. He is expected to manage the reorganization, which Republican \\nleaders have set for Jan. 4. Livingston met privately with his closest \\nadvisers Friday as the impeachment debate unfolded. Some of his colleagues \\nbelieved he had made a mistake in disclosing Thursday night _ just \\nas the House was moving into the divisive debate over impeachment \\n_ that he had ``on occasion strayed from my marriage.'' He told Republican \\nleaders late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine was going to \\nexpose his affairs early next year. Some leaders urged him to keep \\nquiet, but his wife, Bonnie, encouraged him to tell his colleagues \\nimmediately, despite the momentous vote that was nearing on the floor. \\nAt that point Thursday night, Roll Call, a newspaper on Capitol Hill, \\nreported on its Web site that Livingston was going to admit to the \\naffairs and was going to offer to resign. In a closed-door meeting \\nwith his fellow Republicans, he did admit to the affairs but made \\nno offer to step down, receiving three standing ovations instead. \\nThursday night, Livingston stated that he would ``not be intimidated \\nby these efforts'' to exploit his past. But Friday he removed himself \\nfrom public action and that night drew his closest advisers into his \\nconfidence. His aides said Saturday that they had no clue what was \\nhe was contemplating, and few other members were aware of his plans. \\nAsked if he had any advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a newly \\nelected member of the Republican leadership, said: ``I had no idea.'' \\nAsked if there had been internal party pressure on Livingston to resign, \\nRep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: ``I didn't know about it if there \\nwas,'' but added, ``There were some members who were critical of it.'' \\nAs the leaders tried Saturday to hold the party together on and off \\nthe House floor, most Republicans stuck to their prepared scripts \\non the floor in favor of impeaching the president. But some began \\nexpressing their anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who admitted to \\nhis own adulterous affair earlier this year, said after Livingston's \\nresignation: ``Those of us who are sinners must feel wretched today. \\nSomething is going on repeatedly that has to be stopped, and that \\nis a confusion between private acts of infidelity and public acts.'' \\nTo much applause, Hyde declared: ``Congress has no business intruding \\ninto private acts.'' Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, had made \\nthis same distinction between Clinton's sexual indiscretions and Livingston's, \\nsaying that Clinton lied about his private acts and therefore abused \\nthe legal system and his powers. As Livingston said in his statement \\nThursday: ``These indiscretions were not with employees on my staff \\nand I have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'' Democrats \\nhoped that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake up the \\nHouse to how poisoned the atmosphere had become and might prompt Republicans \\nto reconsider the impeachment of Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., \\nsaid, ``We are now starting to offer up sacrificial lambs to whatever \\nterrible disease this is.'' In a stirring speech applauded even by \\nsome Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, \\npraised Livingston as a ``worthy, good and honorable man'' and said \\nhis resignation was a grave mistake. ``It's a terrible capitulation \\nto the negative political forces that are consuming our political \\nsystem and our country,'' Gephardt said, adding that the events of \\nthe last few days showed ``life imitates farce.'' ``We need to stop \\ndestroying imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality,'' \\nhe said, urging his colleagues to ``step back from the abyss'' and \\nreject resignation, impeachment and ``vicious self-righteousness.'' \\n\\nThe only thing certain now is uncertainty. The smart money shouts \\nthat President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs. The smart \\nmoney argues that the Senate could not muster the 67 votes that would \\nbe needed to remove the wounded president from office, which would \\nrequire the defection of 12 Democrats if all the Republicans stand \\nagainst him. The smart money insists that someone will cut a deal \\nto end all this. Maybe so. But the smarter money whispers, ``Remember.'' \\nRemember that everyone in Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., \\nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the House would never, ever, \\ntreat impeachment as a partisan issue. Wrong. Remember that all the \\npundits predicted Democratic losses in the midterm elections, and \\nwhen the opposite happened, they said impeachment was dead. Twice \\nwrong. And remember that in the New Year the nation may travel down \\na road it has never traveled before. One other president, Andrew Johnson \\nof Tennessee, has been tried by the Senate, of course. But that happened \\nin a different country _one with only 37 states, with primitive communications, \\nwith a simple economy based largely on agriculture, with only minimal \\ncommitments abroad. In the toxic politics of century's end in Washington, \\nthe inconceivable has become the commonplace. The wholly unanticipated \\nannouncement Saturday morning by Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., that \\nhe would not serve as speaker and would resign from Congress, following \\nhis equally unanticipated disclosure on Thursday night of several \\nextramarital affairs, only deepened the capital's profound sense of \\ninsecurity. The deadly sweep of the scythe of neo-puritanism appears \\nunstoppable, at least for the moment, and Livingston's forthcoming \\nresignation will increase the pressure on the president to do likewise. \\n``You've set before us an example,'' the leader of House Republican \\nmajority, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, told Livingston Saturday. ``The \\nexample is that principle comes before power.'' The Democrats made \\nthe opposite point, arguing that the Livingston case showed how very \\nwrong it was to savage people for personal pecaddillos. One transcendently \\nimportant thing remains the same: Although surrounded by judicial \\ntrappings and presided over by the chief justice, trials of presidents \\nare political processes, with power residing in the hands of elective \\npoliticians. In addition to narrow legal issues of guilt or innocence, \\nthey can weigh considerations of party, the nation's future, their \\nown individual political well-being and almost anything else they \\ncare to weigh in reaching a verdict. The longer they took, the more \\nnumerous the call for resignation would probably be. Even before Saturday's \\nepochal roll-calls, four of ten Americans interviewed in the latest \\nNew York Times/CBS News Poll said they thought the president should \\nstep down if he were to be indicted, despite the fact that a large \\nmajority voiced disapproval of the impeachment proceedings. What lies \\nbehind that seeming contradiction, of course, is the fear that Clinton, \\nand the country with him, would be incapacitated. No one took Andrew \\nJohnson very seriously after he escaped conviction by a single vote. \\nBut Clinton, a man of powerful will whose whole life has been a series \\nof comebacks, has already embarked on an effort to show that he can \\ndo the nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed his way back to respectability \\nafter leaving the White House when no one thought he could; Clinton \\nintends to re-establish his authority while still in office. He has \\none great advantage: Two-thirds of the American public continues to \\nvoice its approval of his political stewardship, whatever it thinks \\nof him as a man. The president will press hard, despite his much-reduced \\nleverage, for a deal on censure. Indeed, in as fine a piece of political \\nirony as one could ask for, he has already sought to enlist former \\nSen. Bob Dole, the Republican he defeated in 1996, as an emissary \\nto the Senate majority. The numbers are not unpromising: with the \\nhelp of six Republicans, the 45 Democrats could end the trial at any \\ntime and pass a censure resolution that the House would surely take \\nup. There are enough Republican moderates and sometime party-buckers \\nto make that a plausible target. But the Republican leader in the \\nSenate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who has made his unwillingness \\nto take the president's word plainly evident in recent days, is determined \\nto fight such a trial-aborting arrangement. It is clear that Clinton's \\nreputation has been stained forever, no matter what the Senate does. \\nThe spot will not out. History will remember this man who so coveted \\na glowing legacy not as an impresario of economic growth, not as the \\nMoses who pointed the way to the 21st century, but as the second president \\never to be impeached, if not as the first to be ousted. That harsh \\nword, ``impeachment,'' will cling to his name as surely as ``Teapot \\nDome'' clings to Harding's and ``Depression'' to Hoover's. But he \\nis not alone in having suffered grievous injury in the political avalanche \\nthat was shaken loose by the disclosure of Clinton's sexual relationship \\nwith a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' \\npublic support has shriveled to 40 percent in the new Times/CBS News \\npoll, its lowest level in 14 years, and it could go lower once the \\nfact of impeachment sinks in. Journalists are seen by many as jackals, \\nindifferent to whatever personal suffering or national angst they \\nmay cause as long as they get the story, and none too concerned about \\naccuracy. In fact, the whole political culture of the 1990s, with \\nits criminalization of political conduct and its seeming indifference \\nto important national and international issues, has fallen into disrepute \\nwith ordinary Americans. The last week seemed to crystallize the long-term \\ndecline in political civility. Republicans called Clinton a liar, \\neven as he was committing American pilots to the skies over Iraq, \\nand Democrats accused their rivals of conducting a political lynching \\nor a political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may have been the biggest \\nvictim of all. Party lines on Saturday's rolls calls held as firm \\nas leg irons. Almost all of the Republicans who opposed impeachment \\ndid so not exclusively on legal principle but at least partly because \\nof special political circumstances _ the Democratic majority in Rep. \\nConstance Morella's district in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, \\nfor example, and the gratitude of Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., for Clinton's \\npeacemaking in Ireland. It is hard to see who has emerged from it \\nwith reputation enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch \\nin the face of deception. If some of the threats and dire predictions \\nuttered by House Democrats in recent days are to be taken at face \\nvalue, the nation is entering upon an Era of Bad Feelings, the polar \\nopposite of a second Era of Good Feelings, similar to that of the \\n1820s, that Clinton had hoped to preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, \\ncompared Clinton on Friday to Sir Thomas More, executed for treason \\nin 1535 because of his religious beliefs. He quoted More's words as \\nan admonition for today: ``What you have hunted me for is not my actions \\nbut for the thoughts of my heart. It is a long road you have opened. \\nGod help the statesmen who walk your road.'' But amidst all the loose \\ntalk about permanent damage to this institution or that, remember: \\nThings change with startling speed in modern American politics, and \\nthe institutions of American government have proved extraordinarily \\nresilient. President Nixon, it was almost universally agreed in 1974, \\nhad weakened the American presidency for many decades to come. Nobody \\nsaid that after eight years under Ronald Reagan, and that was only \\n15 years later. \\n\\nThe New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' \\ndrive for a partisan impeachment based soley on party-line voting \\npower rather than any sense of proportion produced an unexpected sideshow \\nin the resignation of Rep. Bob Livingston from his role as future \\nspeaker of the House. Analysts on both sides of the struggle over \\nPresident Clinton's future will point to Livingston's downfall as \\nevidence of a generalized breakdown in legislative civility on Capitol \\nHill. Democrats will see a moral symmetry, depicting Livingston as \\na victim of the sexual puritanism he was wielding against Clinton. \\nBut the one thing that no one should fall for is Livingston's invitation \\nto use his resignation as a model for resolving the crisis at the \\nWhite House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, but it should \\nnot shake the foundations of the somber constitutional process now \\nunderway. By lying under oath, Clinton made it necessary for the House \\nto consider impeachment. The evidence convinced most Americans that \\nthe president should be censured, but not removed from office. Livingston \\nallowed GOP partisans to block censure in the House. The result is \\nthat after Saturday's expected impeachment vote, after Livingston's \\nunexpected announcement, the mission of the Senate remains the same. \\nIt must resist those Republicans who want to short-circuit the constitutional \\nprocess with demands for resignation, and it must use the upcoming \\nSenate trial as a forum for finding a censure commensurate with the \\npresident's personal dishonesty and offenses against the law. These \\nrequire stern punishment but not removal from office. In undertaking \\nthis work, the Senate must also reassure the American people that \\na decisive wisdom at the core of our messy-looking political system \\nhas not melted down. In such distempered times, this is a shining \\nopportunity for the Senate. Its members pride themselves on being \\nthe Republic's fire wall against presidential excess and the popular \\nor partisan passions that sometimes seize the House of Representatives. \\nNo one can predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will \\nrise to the defining challenge of his career or whether he will surrender \\nto the mean streak he acquired during 16 grumpy years as a minority \\nmember of the House. We would like to see Lott reach for a starring \\nrole in history. Lott's growling response to questions about censure \\nis not encouraging. He may be right that the Constitution requires \\nhim to convene a trial, but nothing in that document prevents him \\nfrom speedily guiding the Senate toward censure negotiations. Indeed, \\na simple majority vote _ 45 Democrats plus 6 cooperating Republicans \\n_ can end the Senate trial at any time, clearing the way for introduction \\nof the kind of censure resolution suggested by former Sen. Bob Dole. \\nIn an intriguing report on NBC, Tim Russert described discussions \\namong a bipartisan group of senators about a censure that would involve \\nsome form of presidential confession, a fine and a joint congressional \\nrequest that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton \\nin the courts. If Lott refuses to allow a bipartisan search for censure, \\nthe burden will fall upon respected members like Joseph Lieberman \\non the Democratic side and Orrin Hatch for the Republicans. Through \\ncooperation, they can guide the Senate toward a punishment that fixes \\nClinton in history as a president who lied under oath, but avoids \\nthe taint of partisan vengeance associated with the House impeachment \\nvote. The Senate's historic reputation for prudence requires it to \\nfind appropriate punishment for a personally weak president who has \\ndamaged the rule of law, but not threatened the stability of the government. \\n\\nRejecting a last-minute Democratic attempt to soften its action to \\ncensure, the House of Representatives moved to impeach President William \\nJefferson Clinton for perjury on Saturday and to call on the Senate \\nto try him, convict him and remove him from office. But even before \\nthe vote, Republicans pressed another line of attack, demanding Clinton's \\nresignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated for speaker last month \\nby his party, startled the House when he announced he would not run \\nfor speaker and would resign from the House after 21 years of service. \\nHe urged the president to ``heal the wounds that you have created. \\nYou, sir, may resign your post.'' Angry Democrats booed and shouted, \\n``You resign!'' Livingston continued, ``I can only challenge you in \\nsuch fashion if I am willing to heed my own words.'' Apologizing again \\nfor extramarital affairs revealed two days ago, he said, ``I believe \\nI had it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job or be the \\nkind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstances.'' \\nThen he bolted from the House chamber, nearly knocking reporters and \\nmembers down. (The House voted 228-206 to approve the first article \\nof impeachment, accusing Clinton of committing perjury before a federal \\ngrand jury. The vote was announced at 1:24 p.m. EST, leaving the 42nd \\npresident to face trial in the Senate on whether he should be removed \\nfrom office.) Clinton rejected the advice immediately. His spokesman, \\nJoe Lockhart, said, ``The president has no intention of resigning.'' \\nBy calling on Livingston to reconsider, the president argued more \\nbroadly against resignation under fire. Perhaps speaking to both cases, \\nLockhart said, ``It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics \\nof personal destruction.'' Unless Clinton changes course, this would \\nbe only the second impeachment of a president in the 209-year history \\nof the Republic, and the first since Andrew Johnson was acquitted \\nin 1868. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has \\ninsisted that no bargaining over censure can prevent it from starting. \\nBut the Senate could halt a trial later as part of a deal. Considering \\nthe degree of partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling the two-thirds \\nmajority required under the Constitution for conviction is most unlikely. \\nSixty-seven votes would be required, and there are only 55 Republicans \\nin the Senate, along with 45 Democrats. Four articles of impeachment \\nbefore the House charged Clinton with perjury in lying about his affair \\nwith Monica Lewinsky to a federal grand jury here on Aug. 17. He was \\nalso charged with perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, \\nobstruction of justice and abuse of power. The Republican argument, \\nover and over, was that Clinton had lied in denying having sexual \\nrelations with Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority \\nleader, said, ``A nation of laws cannot be ruled by a person who breaks \\nthe law.'' Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut said: ``There can be \\nno justice without the truth. That is just profoundly so, and that \\nis why perjury matters.'' Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin began the \\nDemocrats' arguments by saying, ``What the president did was wrong, \\nboth personally and morally, but his acts did not threaten our democracy \\nand thus do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses as defined \\nby our founding fathers in our Constitution.'' Rep. Charles Schumer, \\nNew York's senator-elect, said: ``The rule of law requires that the \\npunishment fit the crime. Allow us to vote for censure.'' Saturday's \\nvotes were the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between \\nCongress and a president since Richard M. Nixon resigned in the face \\nof impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. 9, 1974. But while that \\ncase spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic headquarters in the \\nWatergate complex, this one began with a murky land deal in Arkansas \\nin 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel \\nunder the law enacted in the wake of Watergate, the investigation \\nspread to examine Clinton's affair with a White House intern. All \\nyear it has preoccupied the capital despite an immense disconnect \\nwith public opinion; since the scandal became public in January, polls \\nhave shown that the public opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry \\nbrought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a \\nCBS News Poll of 548 people showed that only 38 percent wanted their \\nrepresentative to vote for impeachment; 58 percent wanted a no vote. \\nThe conflict now enters uncharted seas, since the Nixon resignation \\ncut the matter short and the Johnson trial occurred in a different \\nAmerica, with no nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion \\npolls. But the capital was still rife with confident speculation. \\nSome guessed, or hoped, that the results of the recent poll, which \\nshowed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the \\nnation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star \\nwitnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought the Republicans, \\nseeing dismal numbers in polls about their party's standing in the \\nUnited States, would be the first to blink. With a majority in the \\nSenate, they have the power to end a trial at any time after the Senate \\nreceives notice of impeachment on the day it convenes, Jan. 6, or \\nthe next day. But while Clinton has focused on the polls, and the \\nCBS News survey showed that 64 percent still approve of his handling \\nof his job as president, resignation could almost immediately subject \\nhim to criminal prosecution. And Republicans have steadfastly ignored \\nthe polls all year, and confronted them directly on Saturday. Representative \\nJ.C. Watts of Oklahoma, newly elected as chairman of the Republican \\ncaucus, said: ``What's popular isn't always right. You say polls are \\nagainst this. Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle. \\nPolls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced \\nslavery and ridiculed women's rights. ``You say we must draw this \\nto a close. I say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not \\nwith a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big \\nfat lead of a No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America \\ncan see it. The point is not whether the president can prevail, but \\nwhether truth can prevail.'' Last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee \\nrecommended the four articles of impeachment, Clinton's side still \\nhoped to prevail with the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderates who \\nwere uncommitted. As the week wore on, almost all of them broke against \\nthe president. One who did not, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, \\nsaid Saturday: ``After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September, \\nand his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I concluded \\nthat impeachable offenses were not proven, and that the proven offenses \\nwere not impeachable. ``But the president's continued failure to come \\nto grips with his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members \\nof the Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change \\nof heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who originally \\nopposed impeachment and who now support it, and the strong and powerful \\nopinion of so many of my constituents who oppose my position and who \\nwanted the president impeached caused me to rethink my position.'' \\nHe added: ``Yesterday morning, before I visited with the president, \\nI concluded that my original position was the correct one, for me. \\nI believe that the impeachable offenses have not been proven, and \\nthat the proven offenses are not impeachable.'' But Rep. Tom DeLay \\nof Texas, who has led the Republican effort to force Clinton from \\noffice, dismissed his and other arguments as moral relativism. He \\nbegan by praising Livingston: ``There is no greater American in my \\nmind, at least today, than Bob Livingston, because he understood what \\nthis debate was all about. It was about honor and decency and integrity \\nand the truth; everything that we honor in this country. It was also \\na debate about relativism vs. absolute truth.'' He continued, ``The \\npresident's defenders have said that the president is morally reprehensible, \\nthat he is reckless, that he has violated the trust of the American \\npeople, lessened their esteem for the office of president and dishonored \\nthe office which they have entrusted him, and that _ but that doesn't \\nrise to the level of impeachment.'' Rep. Jose Serrano of New York \\nsaid, ``My constituents don't hate Bill Clinton; they love him and \\nthey're praying for him right at this very moment. You may have the \\nvotes today to impeach him, but you don't have the American people. \\nAnd let me tell you something, I grew up in the public housing projects \\nof the South Bronx. I can see a bunch of bullies when I see them. \\nThe bullies get theirs, and you're going to get yours, too. Rep. Henry \\nHyde of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman who brought the \\ncharges to the House floor, said the Congress and the American people \\nneeded to distinguish between private acts of infidelity and public \\nacts by public officials. In Clinton's case, he said, the House was \\ndealing with ``a serial violator of the oath who is the chief law-enforcement \\nofficer.'' He said that the Senate could be ``innovative and creative'' \\nin deciding how best to punish Clinton, but that the House was bound \\nby the Constitution to move ahead with articles of impeachment. ``Justice \\nis so important to the most humble among us,'' Hyde said. ``Equal \\njustice under the law _ that's what we're fighting for.'' Democrats, \\nreading from the same Constitution, voiced diametrically opposite \\nconclusions, and attacked the fairness of the proceedings that culminated \\nSaturday. ``We're losing track of distinction between sins and crimes,'' \\nsaid Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``We're lowering the standards of \\nimpeachment. What the president has done is not a great and dangerous \\noffense to the republic.'' Democrats also criticized Republicans for \\nimpeaching Clinton at the very moment that U.S. troops waged war against \\nIraq. ``Six days before Christmas our troops are in battle, and a \\nlame-duck Congress is rushing to overthrow the commander in chief,'' \\nsaid Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat. \\nThe ghosts of Watergate hung over the House chamber. One Republican \\ncited the parallels between the charges the House Judiciary Committee \\nbrought against Nixon 25 years ago, and the counts that the same committee \\nbrought to the House floor for affirmation on Saturday. ``Nixon cheated. \\nHe cheated the electoral system,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South \\nCarolina Republican on the Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, \\nthe full House is voting to impeach Clinton ``because we believe he \\ncommitted crimes that result in cheating our judicial system.'' But \\nmost of the day's debate was firmly rooted in Clinton's effort to \\nconceal his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia \\nRepublican on the Judiciary Committee who is one of Clinton's fiercest \\ncritics, held up copies of the U.S. Criminal Code, the Judiciary Committee's \\nreport on the impeachment inquiry and, finally, the Constitution, \\nin defending his decision to impeach the president. ``Today, we rely \\non the three pillars of our society: the law itself, evidence and \\nthe Constitution,'' said Barr. ``There is no joy in upholding the \\nlaw,'' Watts said. ``If we cannot see lawlessness, our children cannot \\nrecognize it. How can we tell our children honesty is the best policy \\nwhen we don't demand it as a policy?'' But Democrats assailed the \\nvery premise on which the Republican majority built its impeachment \\ncase against Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking \\nDemocrat on the Judiciary Committee, assailed the four articles of \\nimpeachment, count by count, as unfounded by evidence and failing \\nto rise to impeachment. He saved his most savage scorn for the final \\ncount, abuse of power. ``The majority has simply tried to dress up \\nthe perjury counts in the Watergate abuse-of-power language,'' Conyers \\nsaid. \\n\\nBob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public \\nrole Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President \\nClinton. His previous 24 hours had been his most visible in the month \\nsince his party nominated him as speaker and perhaps the most excruciating \\nin his public career: He spent most of the day in a chaotic procedural \\nwrangle over the terms of Friday's debate; he ended it by telling \\nhis Republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs during \\nhis 20-year tenure in Congress. His disclosure followed an investigation \\nby Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine, who said Friday \\nat a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication \\nhad learned that Livingston had had adulterous affairs during the \\nlast 10 years. Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose \\nthe ``hypocrisy'' of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton \\nand in October offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had \\nhad affairs with members of Congress. He said Friday that this larger \\ninvestigation, to be published perhaps as soon as January, would reveal \\nwhat he described as indiscretions of several other Republicans. He \\nsaid he had no connection with the White House but that he had hired \\nan investigative firm based in Washington and made up of former employees \\nof the FBI and the CIA. He would not confirm whether the firm is Terry \\nLenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which has done work for the president's \\nprivate lawyers. Livingston was unavailable to reporters Friday. He \\nspent some time Friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of \\nthe House chamber, listening to the debate over whether to impeach \\nClinton for lying about his own sexual indiscretions. Several colleagues \\nknelt at Livingston's knee, whispered to him and patted him on the \\nback. He spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber, \\navoiding the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between \\nthe House and his regular office across the street. The only word \\nout of his aides was that the Navy had awarded contracts worth millions \\nof dollars for ships to be built in his Louisiana district at the \\nAvondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, a handful of Democrats \\nmade only oblique allusions to human failures. For example, Rep. John \\nLewis, D-Ga., said: ``Let he that has no sin cast the first stone. \\nWho, who among us has not sinned?'' But no one said that Livingston's \\ndisclosure or the mild Democratic attempts to exploit it would influence \\ntheir votes on impeachment. Rather, on the House floor and in hallway \\nchitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed to be the last thing that either \\nRepublicans or Democrats wanted to talk about. ``Bob Livingston is \\na first-rate human being,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who has \\nworked closely and sparred with Livingston on the Appropriations Committee, \\nin an interview. ``I will repeat what the nuns taught me at St. James \\na long time ago: We would all be a hell of a lot better off looking \\nafter our own souls rather than trying to evaluate somebody else's. \\nNone of us have any business even having an opinion on it.'' Even \\nconservative Republicans seemed ready to overlook the disclosure. \\n``We're not going to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated \\nyour vows with your wife,''' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like \\nmany, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct \\nfrom Clinton's by saying that the president had ``trampled'' on the \\nlegal system whereas Livingston's behavior was strictly private. Despite \\nFlynt's claims, many Republicans blamed the Clinton administration \\nfor smearing Livingston, although they offered no evidence. ``This \\nisn't just happening on its own,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- \\nCalif. \\n\\nIn the end, the will of the people meant nothing. Bob Livingston couldn't \\nhave been clearer about that. His mind and the minds of his followers \\nwere closed. Even as the bombing continued in Iraq and Americans from \\ncoast to coast were clamoring for an alternative to impeachment, even \\nas his own adulterous past was being flushed out in the grotesque \\ninvasions of privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient \\npursuit of the president, even as the country began to contemplate \\nthe destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial, the \\nspeaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: ``Let us disregard \\nthe outside influences.'' The radicals on the Hill would hear nothing \\nbut the echoes of their own fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And that \\ncontinued even after the stunning announcement Saturday morning that \\nLivingston would quit the House. Dismayed by the partisan stampede, \\nDick Gephardt, the Democratic leader, warned during the impeachment \\ndebate on Friday: ``In your effort to uphold the Constitution, you \\nare trampling the Constitution.'' David Bonior, the Democratic whip, \\nsaid: ``This is wrong. It is unfair. It is unjust. At a time when \\nevents in the world and the challenges at home demand that we stand \\nunited, censure is the one solution that can bring us together. To \\nmy colleagues across the aisle, I say let go of your obsession. Listen \\nto the American people.'' But the voices of reason would not be heard. \\nLivingston and his right-wing colleagues, the Tom DeLays, the Henry \\nHydes, the Bob Barrs, were on a mission of destruction and would not \\nbe denied. Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They \\ncould protest and demonstrate, send faxes and E-mails. It didn't matter. \\nThe right was on the march and democracy was on the run. Rep. Thomas \\nBarrett, a Democrat from Wisconsin, tried to remind his Republican \\ncolleagues that the Constitution ``does not allow you to remove a \\npresident from office because you can't stand him.'' He was, of course, \\nignored. The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterly \\npartisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in defiance \\nof the will of the people. The party's contempt for the voters was \\narrogantly but quite adequately summed up by Alan Simpson, the former \\nsenator from Wyoming, who said: ``The attention span of Americans \\nis which movie is coming out next month and whether the quarterly \\nreport on their stock will change.'' If the voters are the dopes that \\nMr. Simpson thinks they are, then come 2000 everyone will have forgotten \\nthere was an impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., \\nwas probably closer to the truth when he said, ``I warn my colleagues \\nthat you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds \\nyou sow today.'' One of the many strange events of the past couple \\nof weeks was the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided \\nRepublicans, the so-called moderates, surrendered their independence \\nand lined up like lackeys to follow the right wing's lead. All proclaimed \\nloudly that they were voting on principle, but in fact it was an exercise \\nin mass cowardice, exemplified by Rep. John McHugh of upstate New \\nYork. McHugh announced on Tuesday that he would vote for impeachment. \\nBut if his decision was based on principle, he had an odd way of expressing \\nit. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared to have no stomach for \\na Senate conviction or removal of the president from office. Of his \\ncolleagues in the Senate, McHugh said, ``I, for one, would accept, \\neven welcome, their mercy.'' In other words, let the Senate do the \\nheavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may have wished out loud for \\nmercy, but he clearly was too frightened of the right-wingers in the \\nHouse to cast a compassionate vote himself. The GOP can no longer \\nconceal that it is a party of extremists, of right-wing absolutists, \\na party out of step with the political and cultural orientation of \\nmost Americans. Bob Livingston may be leaving, but his arrogant comment \\ncan still serve as his party's slogan. ``Let us disregard the outside \\ninfluences.'' Let us disregard the people. \\n\", \"\\nWhether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger \\nor some other business combination, America's economic history is \\nalready being rewritten. In energy as in businesses like financial \\nservices, telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and \\ntechnology have made unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary. \\nOil companies like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an additional \\npressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago. Crude oil prices \\nhave fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year to levels, \\nadjusted for inflation, not seen since before the first oil embargo \\n25 years ago. As such, the oil companies, having spent years cutting \\ntheir costs, are desperate for further savings in order to continue \\noperating profitably with such low prices. Exxon and Mobil are the \\ntwo largest, strongest competitors to emerge from the nation's most \\nfamous antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard \\nOil Trust. Now they face a Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger \\nthan either of them. They will also confront a British Petroleum PLC \\nmade far more potent in the United States by its agreement this summer \\nto buy Amoco Corp. for $48.2 billion. Industry executives say further \\ndeals on this scale are inevitable. Executives at both companies did \\nnot return calls Thursday for comment on the talks, and it was unclear \\nThursday night what the outcome might be. But if Exxon and Mobil agree \\nto become one, antitrust regulators are likely to be cautious about \\nputting back together much of what they long ago broke apart. Even \\nso, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from \\ncombining giant energy companies would do more to lower costs than \\nthe more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would \\ndo to raise them. ``The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the \\nconsumer,'' said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research \\nAssociates. If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could \\nprove heaviest for energy industry employees. Analysts say that of \\nthe about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, \\nand the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would \\nbe likely to lose their jobs. Exxon, with Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, \\nwith Lucio A. Noto, both have chief executives who have been preoccupied \\nwith the humbling accommodations that low oil prices have made necessary. \\nOil companies were everybody's favorite targets during the trust-busting \\nera early this century and again during the Arab oil embargoes of \\nthe 1970s. Now they seem especially vulnerable as demand weakens in \\nmuch of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weighing \\nfurther on already depressed prices. ``They're pitiful, helpless giants,'' \\nsaid Ronald Chernow, the author of ``Titan,'' a biography of John \\nD. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, these giants are \\ncompelled to continue cutting costs and spreading the risks of their \\nhuge, expensive international projects that are needed to develop \\noil reserves needed for the next century. Mobil, with $58.4 billion \\nin sales last year, might seem large enough to undertake anything. \\nBut in competing for rights to develop huge natural gas fields in \\nTurkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, Mobil was unable to match \\nShell's offer to build a pipeline for $1 billion or more. Oil companies \\nhave decided that they cannot count on a rebound in oil prices to \\nrevive their fortunes any time soon. Earlier this month, the Energy \\nDepartment predicted that the collapse of Asian demand would continue \\nto depress oil prices for nearly a decade, and by as much as $5.50 \\na barrel in the year 2000. And Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum \\nExporting Countries put off until March any decision on extending \\ntheir oil production cutbacks to prop up prices. Moreover, improving \\ntechnology for exploration and production and the opening of new regions \\nto development have added to the already huge supply of oil that is \\non hand now. In response, many energy companies have already begun \\na new wave of cutbacks in their staffs and operations. To further \\nreduce costs, companies like Mobil are forming partnerships that stop \\nshort of full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agreed to combine its \\nEuropean refining and marketing operations with British Petroleum's, \\nresulting in annual savings of about $500 million. Shell and Texaco \\nthen formed a refining partnership in the United States. In the face \\nof these partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, an energy analysts with the \\nJames A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, ``if you're \\nan Exxon, how do you compete?'' Though Mobil and Exxon might have \\nhigh concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United \\nStates, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than \\nbefore oil prices collapsed in the 1980s. Thousands of convenience \\nstores now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies, \\nand foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their supplies \\nthrough acquired companies like Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil has been \\nhunting for ways of becoming large and lean enough to survive. He \\ntook the lead in the deal with British Petroleum and has considered \\nbuying up smaller companies. And he has made it clear that corporate \\nor personal pride would never block a deal. In the European agreement \\nwith British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses have come down from \\nthe fronts of many gas stations, while the green and yellow BP logos \\nhave gone up. As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, an \\nanalyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, ``If the price is right, \\negos will not get in the way.'' In the past, Mobil reportedly had \\nfurther talks with British Petroleum about other combinations, as \\nwell as talks with Amoco about forming an American refining venture. \\nThe company was also interested in Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. began \\nlooking to divest itself of that oil and gas business. But no deals \\nwere reached. More recently, there was speculation on Wall Street \\nthat Mobil had been talking with Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase \\nof Amoco put more pressure on Noto to seek a deal, Hervey said. ``I \\ndon't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum \\nhad not pulled the trigger,'' he said. The British Petroleum-Amoco \\ndeal, progressing quickly since the August announcement towards an \\nexpected $2 billion in annual savings, has put even companies as large \\nas Exxon on the spot. There, Raymond has so far concentrated more \\non making his operations more efficient than on finding allies. Though \\nRoyal Dutch/Shell's financial resources are greater than Exxon's, \\nsome analysts say Exxon still has the size and soundness to absorb \\na company of Mobil's size. Only the largest oil companies can afford \\nto take advantage of today's best opportunities. Finding new fields \\nin the deep waters off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of \\nMexico can require platforms costing $1 billion or more. Producing \\noil in the states of the former Soviet Union has taken more time and \\nmoney than many investors anticipated. In September, Noto was among \\nthe American executives invited by a Saudi leader visiting Washington \\nto greatly step up investments in his country, too. Noto spent from \\n1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself, building up Mobil operations \\nincluding a huge refinery. But any new partnerships with the Saudis \\nmight require both Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital. Back when \\nStandard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard \\nOil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York. Even \\nafter the Standard Oil monopoly was broken up, they remained for several \\nyears in the same building in Manhattan. Chernow, the Rockefeller \\nbiographer, noted that two pieces of the Standard Oil trust are already \\nlikely to be united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio \\nin the 1970s, and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana. The break-up \\nof Standard Oil and the resulting competition has often been cited \\nas a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft. \\nChernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil \\nto go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft. ``Exxon \\nwould not be obviously larger than its leading competitors, the way \\nMicrosoft is,'' he said. In the energy business today, he added, ``there \\nare other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle.'' \\n\\nExxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed \\nFriday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust \\nlawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that \\nany deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such \\na new corporate behemoth. Those divestitures would further reshape \\nan industry already undergoing a broad transformation because of the \\nlow price of oil. But the mergers and other corporate combinations \\nare also beginning to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust \\nofficials, one that may prove particularly challenging to Exxon and \\nMobil. Although the companies only confirmed that they were discussing \\nthe possibility of a merger, a person close to the discussions said \\nthe boards of both Exxon and Mobil were expected to meet Tuesday to \\nconsider an agreement. Shares of both surged on the New York Stock \\nExchange. Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily \\npresent antitrust problems in an Exxon-Mobil merger because competition \\nin those areas is brisk. But in retailing and marketing operations, \\nan Exxon-Mobil combination would be ``like Ford merging with General \\nMotors, Macy's with Gimbels,'' said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust lawyer \\nin New York who represented Texaco in its acquisition of Getty more \\nthan a decade ago. In the United States, the deal would come under \\nthe purview of the Federal Trade Commission, which under the Clinton \\nadministration has examined large corporate mergers with a vigor not \\nseen since the 1970s. The agency has blocked a number of proposed \\nmergers, such as the $4 billion combination of Staples and Office \\nDepot, the two largest office supply discounters, and two deals involving \\nthe four largest drug wholesalers. On the other hand it has approved \\nother big mergers, such as Boeing's $14 billion acquisition of McDonnell \\nDouglas. The agency's analysis of an Exxon-Mobil combination, a senior \\nofficial said Friday, will turn on how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's \\nStandard Oil trust before it was dismantled by the Supreme Court in \\n1911. ``The big antitrust issue is whether, by a merger or alliance, \\nthey will be able to get the competition of one another off their \\nbacks, particularly against the background of BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco,'' \\nsaid Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York University School \\nof Law and an antitrust expert. ``It may be that we are looking at \\na consolidation on the world level that looked like the consolidation \\non the national level 100 years ago.'' The Federal Trade Commission \\nrecently approved a significant joint venture between Shell and Texaco \\nafter the venture agreed to sell a refinery and divest some retailing \\noperations in Hawaii and California. It is also considering the proposed \\n$54 billion merger of British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have \\nto re-examine that combination in light of the new talks between Exxon \\nand Mobil. ``In the past, when there have been two mergers involving \\nthe same industry, the government has considered them together in \\ndeciding how to deal with them,'' said Terry Calvani, a former commissioner \\nat the Federal Trade Commission whose clients now include Chevron. \\nBut coming in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals, \\na combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping \\nretail and refinery businesses in the United States and Europe, poses \\nquestions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s. \\n``It's a real test case,'' said Frederick Leuffer, a senior energy \\nanalyst at Bear Stearns. ``If the FTC let this one go through without \\nmajor divesting, then everything would be fair game. Why couldn't \\nGM merge with Ford?'' While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil is viewed \\nby Washington officials and industry executives as ancient history, \\nExxon and Mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing \\nand refining markets, and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals. \\nLeuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in this case ``could \\nbe so large that they are deal-breakers.'' Other analysts and lawyers, \\nwhile disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal, \\nsaid the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations \\nand that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum \\nof constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials. \\n``These are not absolute obstacles,'' said John Hervey, an analyst \\nat Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In the past, when two big oil \\ncompanies have merged, aggressive attorneys general from the states \\nhave almost always become involved in raising questions because of \\nthe high visibility of the local gas station. ``When a state attorney \\ngeneral drives by and sees four stations on a corner and two of them \\nare Mobil and Exxon, they are certain to raise questions,'' Axinn \\nsaid. Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations of retailing \\nand marketing concerns in the Northeast, the Southwest and the West \\nCoast, where they also have big refining operations. Because the two \\ncompanies are involved in everything from exploration and shipping \\nto refining and retailing, the meaning of the deal for consumers will \\ntake months for the regulators to sort out. The regulators examining \\nsuch a transaction would dissect each business, determine whether \\nits market is global, national or more local, and determine whether \\nthe combined entity has too high a concentration of the business in \\nthose areas. Experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to \\npermit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production \\nbusinesses because those areas are already highly competitive and \\na merger would not result in higher prices. Hervey said those markets \\nare already so fragmented that the combined market share of major \\nAmerican and European oil companies is only 17 percent. \\n\\nExxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining \\ntheir business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday. \\nIt was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing. If the companies \\nwere to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of \\nrevenue. A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial \\nTimes of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks between Exxon, \\nwhose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General Electric, \\nand Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices have sunk \\nto their lowest in almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger \\nthan Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue. \\nFinancial terms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday. \\nNeither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two \\nparts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken \\nup by the Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon was then known as Standard \\nOil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard \\nOil of New York and Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, which has a market value \\nof $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which has a market value of $61.1 billion, \\nhave a history of being fiercely independence. Both have already cut \\nback on staff and made themselves lean in order to survive long periods \\nwhen oil prices are low. But this has been a particularly unsettling \\nyear for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude \\noil prices will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives of most \\noil companies have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable \\npartners. This summer, British Petroleum announced a $48.2 billion \\nagreement to buy Amoco Corp., creating the world's third-largest oil \\ncompany and prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation. \\n``It showed that megamergers are doable,'' said Adam Sieminski, an \\nanalyst for BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that a combination \\nbetween Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has \\nbeen known for being a proud company that has said in the past that \\nit would not want to merge. Exxon, he added, is a ``well run company \\nthat likes to grow its own businesses.'' He added that the heads of \\nboth companies, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which is based \\nin Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief \\nexecutive of Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., are different \\npersonalities. ``It will not be easy,'' he said of combining the two \\nfar-flung companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas \\nstations that overlap in the United States and Europe. ``If you offer \\nenough money you can make anything happen,'' he added. Both companies \\nare under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive \\nin the long term. Like other oil companies, they had hoped to quickly \\ntap into the vast reserves of Russia. Even though they were prepared \\nto spend billions, they have held back because of the political and \\neconomic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by Russian officials \\nand oil companies to give up control of vast fields. Thus they have \\nhad to fall back on their own exploration areas such as the deep waters \\nin the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Such exploration is very expensive, \\nand even when large fields are found it often takes platforms costing \\n$1 billion to bring the oil into production. Oil prices have been \\nunder pressure for more than a year, falling more than 40 percent \\nfrom the $20-a-barrel level because of growing inventories of petroleum \\nand declining Asian demand caused by the economic crisis there. On \\nWednesday, crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, \\nto $11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the \\n12-year low of $11.42 reached on June 15. Members of the Organization \\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, \\nnotably Mexico, have tried to stem the price drops with pledges to \\ncut back on production. But those pledges have not always been honored, \\nand rallies in the oil market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC \\nmembers on Wednesday continued their discussion on extending their \\nproduction cutbacks, and an agreement is expected as early as Thursday. \\nIn the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels \\na day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrels. \\nThe main result of that agreement appears to have been to keep oil \\nprices from falling below $10 a barrel. Washington regulators said \\nWednesday that they had not been notified about the Exxon-Mobil discussions. \\nThe Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's \\npending purchase of Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to \\nreceive several months' worth of scrutiny by the commission, which \\nwould review how much of the industry such a merger would control. \\nAnalysts and investment bankers were split about the logic of the \\npossible merger. Some pointed to difficulties that the companies could \\nface if they were combined. ``If you asked me if Exxon needed to be \\nbigger, the answer is probably no,'' said Garfield Miller, president \\nof Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank \\nbased in New York. ``It is hard to say that there is anything in particular \\nto gain.'' In particular, Miller said, the two companies have enormous \\nsimilarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses. \\n``They really do overlap quite a bit,'' he said. ``You really do wonder \\nwhat is the benefit of all that redundancy.'' Another investment banker \\nin the energy business, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also \\nquestioned the rationale for the discussed merger. ``When you look \\nat the BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it,'' the banker said. ``But \\nnone of those reasons apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal.'' But Amy Jaffe, \\nan energy research analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for \\nPublic Policy, said the combination of the two companies would be \\nlogical, in part because it would give them greater influence in bidding \\nfor projects in Middle Eastern countries. ``This is a deal that makes \\nsense,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ``With this combined company, there is no \\nproject that would be too big.'' In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, the \\nmerger would provide each company with new oil and gas assets in areas \\nof the world where they had little influence. ``There are a lot of \\ncomplimentary assets where they are not redundant,'' she said. She \\nsaid that Exxon, for example, has a strong presence in Angola, while \\nMobil does not. And Mobil has significant assets in the Caspian Sea \\nand Nigeria, where Exxon is weak. \\n\\nThey have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. So when the \\n900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here at Mobil's largest domestic \\nrefinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, heard last week that their \\ncompany was discussing a possible merger with Exxon, it was like a \\nsiren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to \\nblow. ``I think it's a terrible thing,'' said Dick Mabry, a refinery \\noperator, as he emerged in the plant's artificial twilight from the \\nmain gate after his 12-hour shift ended at 4:30 on Sunday morning. \\nHe stopped to rub eyes rimmed with red, but on this topic his bedtime \\ncould be delayed. ``It's a revival of the Standard Oil Company. It's \\ngoing to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work. I think the Justice \\nDepartment should step in and stop it.'' Ernest Lewis, whose overalls \\nbore a ``Big E'' patch appropriate to his scale, added his uh-huh's. \\nThe latest evidence of where things were heading hulked right nearby, \\nhe said, glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated \\nby an outside company without the unions that now man the refinery's \\ngenerators. But if the Mobil Corp. has to be sold, Lewis said, noting \\nthe gains in his company stock holdings, a buyer as solid and large \\nas the Exxon Corp. might be the least of all evils. ``If we merged \\nwith Chevron, we'd be Moron,'' he added. A growing American economy \\nthat can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for \\nInternet marketing is still sloughing off workers in older industries, \\nin petroleum as much as any. Those here point to the tote board by \\nthe Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say shows they \\nhave already handled 171 million barrels out of 130 million planned \\nfor the full year. But the numbers that matter even more are the ones \\nlike 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, on nearby gas stations _ the lowest prices, \\nafter inflation, since the Depression. Which is why Mobil and Exxon \\nare considering combining into the world's largest oil company. Some \\npeople close to the talks cautioned that no deal would be considered \\nby their boards until at least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And that \\nis why, beginning last Wednesday evening, the phone at the home of \\nJimmy Herrington, the president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers \\nLocal 4-243 rang without stop. No, he didn't know about that merger \\ntalk on television, said Herrington, who also works full-time producing \\nlubricants. He had asked some Mobil managers, in a meeting earlier \\nthis month, about all the rumors, but they said they had heard nothing. \\nOil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company's \\nefforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office \\nstaff and the professionals, like geologists and engineers, in the \\nfield. One company's accountants could almost do the work for two. \\nBut the crews here fully expect that an Exxon or any other buyer would \\nask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into \\ngasoline, motor oil and other products with even fewer people. Union \\nleaders raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell the refinery. \\nAntitrust regulators, they say, are bound to notice that Exxon has \\nrefineries an hour's drive in one direction and three hours in the \\nother, along a Gulf of Mexico crescent that forms the petrochemical \\nindustry's home. The Beaumont plant, a steaming, humming chemistry \\nset lining the Neches River off the Gulf, has become the prime provider \\nof livelihoods here since it was built almost under the spray of the \\nnearby Spindletop gusher. With mounting overtime that can stretch \\na shift to 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 \\na year. ``People go there to retire there,'' Herrington said, as he \\ndrove around the plant's fenced periphery. Lewis, in his 17th year, \\nis a third-generation employee. But his nephew laboring here too is \\nthe exception. The workers streaming to and from the plant before \\ndawn are mostly balding or going gray, a sign that for a full generation \\nthe refinery has been more concerned about how to get rid of workers \\nthan how to attract them. The cutbacks have, so far, come through \\nattrition, with retirements often encouraged by incentives. But the \\nplywood sheets covering the windows of most of the fast food places \\nand gas stations around Herrington's union hall advertise that the \\nbest times are long gone. His members chafe at the experts who come \\nin from Wall Street to question the justification for every person's \\njob. In tiring and dangerous tasks, they question the elimination \\nof most relief laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness \\nwith overtime (although some like the extra pay, and they say the \\nplant has become safer over the years). They complain about the growing \\nnumbers of outside contractors taking over formerly unionized tasks. \\nBut with many workers choosing to invest at least some retirement \\nsavings in Mobil stock, a 1990s ethos is gaining. Some share credit \\nwith the plant's management for the efficiency measures they agree \\nare necessary for true job security. Some take the attitude that every \\ncompany is always for sale. ``They will not be too concerned about \\nwhat we feel about it,'' said Sam Salim, one of the electrical plant \\nworkers whose future is uncertain. ``But if they fork out $60 billion? \\nI'd look it over.'' With most Mobil executives saying as little as \\npossible for now, calls on Sunday to the local plant manager and a \\ncompany spokesman did not elicit a peep. Union leaders, however, are \\nalready squawking. ''I don't believe creating new monopolies is the \\nway to prop up the industry,'' said Robert Wages, a former refinery \\noperator himself and now the union's president, by telephone Saturday. \\nNevertheless, with admirable foresight the union negotiated a clause \\nin last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that \\nany company buyer would have to keep to its terms. Many members, who \\ntypically came to work after high school, are already molding the \\noil companies' latest exploits into case studies fit for rapacious \\nMBA's. ``They're the biggest,'' said Bobby Whisneant, an assistant \\noperator in the gasoline and lubrication oil units, referring to Exxon. \\nHe was coming, early on Sunday morning, through a plant gate whose \\nwhite canopy seems borrowed from a self-service station. ``So they \\ngo buy the second biggest. That's one way to get rid of the competition. \\nI just hope it's not something like the 80s _ buying companies and \\nscrapping them.'' Or something like the Robber Baron era a century \\nbefore, said Mabry, another operator. ``Didn't the teachers teach \\nus all through school that the Standard Oil Company would never come \\nback? Remember that?'' he said, looking to his friend, Lewis, the \\nBig E, for agreement. ``But I better shut up. I still work for Mobil.'' \\n``Used to,'' Lewis said. \\n\\nNews that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, were in \\nmerger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages \\nare back in vogue. Even before that combination came to light, deal-making \\nwas fast and furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion in corporate \\nacquisitions were either announced or declared imminent. Driving the \\nresurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market, the recognition by \\nmajor corporations that it is getting harder to increase revenues \\ninternally and growing confidence among market players that the economy \\nwill not plunge into a recession next year. There are also industry-specific \\nissues, like low crude-oil prices that are driving oil giants into \\none another's arms. But for investors, mega-marriages are not where \\nthe real money is to be made. Rather, it is among smaller companies, \\nwhose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with \\nstocks that again are near their peaks. If Exxon buys Mobil at close \\nto current prices, deals this month will have a total value of more \\nthan $140 billion _ off from April's peak of $244 billion but three \\ntimes the volume in September, when the stock market was falling. \\nWhich industries are likely to witness the most mergers? Tom Burnett, \\ndirector of Merger Insight, an institutional investment advisory firm \\nin New York, says more deals are a certainty in energy, which is suffering \\nfrom low crude-oil prices. Burnett also says health care executives \\nare finding it tougher than ever to lift earnings. But smaller companies \\nmay be a better way to play the takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor \\nof the Special Situation Investor newsletter in Potomac, Md., said: \\n``Some of the premiums in high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore. \\nThe values are in small-cap stocks.'' Another reason is that deals \\ninvolving smaller-cap candidates are less likely to incur the wrath \\nof antitrust regulators. LaLoggia reckons that the odds of picking \\ntakeover winners increase if an investor focuses on companies already \\npartially owned by another. In the energy sector, Houston Exploration \\nqualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by \\nKeyspan Energy. He also believes more deals are imminent among drug \\nchains and supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says, \\nremain acquisition candidates, though neither is controlled by another \\nconcern. In supermarkets, LaLoggia likes the Great Atlantic &AMP; \\nPacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned by Tengelmann Group of Germany. \\nAnother pick is Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style stores \\nthat is 55 percent owned by the U.S. subsidiary of Groupe Casino, \\nFrance's largest supermarket chain. ``Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final \\nare trading at just about book value,'' LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically \\noccur above book value. Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, \\na maker of housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading \\nnear $39, close to its low for the year. The company has $30 a share \\nin cash on its balance sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent. \\nAfter last month's announced acquisition of Rubbermaid by the Newell \\nCo., LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find itself in an acquirer's \\ncross-hairs. \\n\\nTimes are tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggles the mind to accept \\nthe notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, \\nas British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least \\nto consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing. Still, Big \\nOil and small oil are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and \\nthe high capital costs of exploration. Given the exotic locales of \\nthe most promising, untapped fields, it seems unlikely that exploration \\nwill get cheaper. And with West Texas crude trading at around $12 \\na barrel, it seems a safe bet oil that won't be selling for $100 a \\nbarrel by the turn of the century _ a price some analysts in the early \\n1980s were predicting it would reach. Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher \\nof Petroleum Economics Monthly and a senior adviser to the Brattle \\nGroup, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent some time late last \\nweek talking about Mobil, Exxon and the changing dynamics of the oil \\nbusiness. Following are excerpts from the conversation: Q. (italics)There \\nis a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an Exxon-Mobil deal. \\nDo you see any problems?(end italics) A. Let me say right off that \\nI don't think this is a done deal. I think it is far from that. But \\nif it were to happen, I don't see many problems. BP Amoco is the perfect \\nend-to-end merger, one in which there is little or no overlap with \\nthe company you are merging with. Exxon-Mobil comes close. The first \\nissue is competition in local markets. The only possible problem area \\nthere is on the West Coast, but both companies are pretty small players \\nthere. If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention, \\nit will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly \\ntoward either the Clinton administration's or the European Union's \\npositions on global warming. Q. (italics)Why are you skeptical about \\nthe deal?(end italics) A. Well, Mobil has been trying to get bigger. \\nThey had talks with Amoco. They wanted to buy Conoco. But I don't \\nunderstand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fits into this. \\nThat could be an impediment to an agreement, because in a merger I \\ndon't think he has a place, and he has been a very strong leader. \\nQ. (italics)Mobil is the country's second-biggest oil company, behind \\nExxon. Why do they need to get bigger?(end italics) A. In the first \\ndecade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities \\nwill be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deepest \\npockets will be able to stay in the game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP \\nAmoco. Companies of Mobil's size are probably marginal players. Q. \\n(italics)That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the \\ndownturn in prices.(end italics) A. From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration \\nand production expenditures rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. \\nBut Mobil's expenditures were much more sensitive to price elasticities \\nof oil than Exxon's. They were pushing the envelope, and when prices \\nfell they had to cut back. Exxon has tried to build a very large presence \\nsystematically, without paying much attention to month-to-month or \\neven year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices. They are brutally efficient. \\nQ. (italics)Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil prices \\nwould stay soft for nearly a decade. Do you agree?(end italics) A. \\nYou know, every time I see forecasts that go out that far I want to \\ngo out and buy stock in oil companies. I think we are going to see \\nlow oil prices for six months to a year. It is conceivable we could \\ngo into the next century with oil at $5 a barrel, depending on what \\nhappens to the world economy. During that period, we are going to \\nsee a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production, \\nleading to a reduction in supply coming out of non-OPEC countries. \\nThat will strengthen the hands of the OPEC countries. And when the \\nAsian economies start growing again that will lead to a good deal \\nhigher oil prices, say $20 a barrel, in the next 18 months. Q. (italics)The \\nnumber of oil companies is going to shrink in coming years, regardless, \\nisn't it?(end italics) A. We are probably heading toward a world in \\nwhich there are no more than five or six big oil companies, possibly \\neight. There is really no precedent for having as many big players \\nas we have in the oil business in this modern society. Q. (italics)Do \\nyou think oil stocks are a good investment?(end italics) A. I think \\noil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but it is not a place \\nwhere an investor should plan on making money over the next 9 to 12 \\nmonths. And it is an area where investors need to be careful, because \\nin that period there will be a good deal of consolidation among smaller \\ncompanies. \\n\\nIt was new highs again for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and \\nNasdaq composite indexes Friday as anticipation of a new wave of mergers \\nand a general rush by investors to join the equity rebound pushed \\nstocks up. Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news \\nof continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would \\ncreate the world's largest oil company. Internet and computer stocks \\nalso rallied, helped in part by the announcement on Tuesday of America \\nOnline's purchase of Netscape Communications in a three-way deal involving \\nSun Microsystems. At the same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers \\nTrust are scheduled to formally announce their merger on Monday. ``There \\nis no question that the merger euphoria is the headline,'' said Hugh \\nJohnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corp. ``But \\nthe flow into mutual funds is also strong.'' Exxon rose 1 11/16, to \\n74], while Mobil jumped 7|, to 86. Chevron, reflecting the bounce \\nthat other oil companies got from the merger news, climbed 5\\\\, to \\n85|. Exxon and Chevron, along with IBM, which rose 3\\\\, to 170, were \\nthe main drivers of the Dow Jones industrial average. It climbed 18.80 \\npoints, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,333.08. It now stands just \\n41 points short of the record it set Monday and up 1.9 percent for \\nthe week. Mobil, along with Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which \\nrose 3 13/16, to 128 1/16, were the power behind the S &AMP; P. It \\nclimbed 5.46 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,192.33, a new \\nhigh, the second of the week. It jumped 2.5 percent in the last five \\ntrading days. Cisco Systems, up 2 15/16, to 80; MCI Worldcom, up 1 \\n11/16, to 62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, up 4|, to 80], and Microsoft \\npushed the Nasdaq index to its first new high since July 20. The technology-heavy \\nindex finished 31.23 points, or 1.57 percent, higher, at 2,016.44. \\nIt was up 4.6 percent for the week. Whether Friday's gains will stick \\nwill not be known before Monday. It was a shortened trading session, \\nwith the New York Stock Exchange closing at 1 p.m., and trading volume, \\nat 257 million shares, made it the lightest day of the year. In the \\nbond market, which also closed early because of the Thanksgiving weekend, \\nthe price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, to 101 12/32. The \\nbond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, \\nfell to 5.16 percent from 5.18 percent on Wednesday. Long-term and \\nshort-term yields all slipped lower this week despite new economic \\ndata that indicated the economy was stronger in the third quarter \\nthan expected and seems to be moving along at a good pace in the current \\nquarter. This small recovery in the face of stronger growth is probably \\nbecause new inflation numbers show that prices are in check and analysts \\nare still forecasting that the economy will begin to slow down next \\nyear. Many analysts have noted during the eight-week stock market \\nrally, in which the Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, that \\ninvestors were buying again even though major financial problems around \\nthe world _ including a slumping Asia, a weakening Latin America and \\na troubled Russia _ have not been resolved. Johnson said he thought \\nthat investors, inspired by the Federal Reserve's three interest rate \\ncuts in two months and by the new stimulus package in Japan, assume \\nthat these problems will be solved. ``Investors are looking over the \\nvalley and they like what they see,'' he said. But he worries that \\nthe financial crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997 and was \\nintensified by the effective default of Russia in August, will not \\ngo away quickly. ``It seems that in every financial crisis, everybody \\ngets the impression that the storm has passed,'' Johnson said. ``But \\nit is never that easy.'' \\n\\nThe boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday \\nto consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's \\nlargest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday. \\nThe source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ``the prospects \\nwere good'' for completing an agreement. Exxon and Mobil confirmed \\nFriday that they were discussing ways to combine. They cautioned, \\nhowever, that no agreement had been reached and there was no assurance \\nthey would reach one. The statement sent the stock of both companies \\nsurging, suggesting investors believe the companies will combine. \\nShares of Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, rose $1.6875, or 2.3 \\npercent, to $74.375. Shares of Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, \\nrose $7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $86. Some analysts said that if the \\ntwo giants reached an agreement, it was likely to be in the form of \\na takeover by Exxon of Mobil. Exxon is far larger and financially \\nstronger. Analysts predicted that there would be huge cuts in duplicate \\nstaff from both companies, which employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, \\nan oil analyst for BT Alex. Brown, said that the companies would probably \\nmake cuts to save about $3 billion to $5 billion a year. Sieminski \\nand other analysts said Exxon would have to offer a premium of about \\n15 to 20 percent over its price prior to Monday, when serious speculation \\nof an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil shares \\nup sharply. They said the transaction would probably be an exchange \\nof Mobil shares for Exxon shares. Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price \\na week ago, a takeover of the company would be worth about $70 billion. \\nThe merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe \\npressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive \\nof Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep \\nbig projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices. \\n``This is one of the most intelligent chief executives in the business \\nand a man of considerable ability but he inherited some serious structural \\nproblems in his company,'' said J. Robin West, the chairman of Petroleum \\nFinance Co., a consulting group to the energy industry based in Washington. \\nHe said that Mobil's prime assets include the Arun natural gas field \\nin Indonesia, one of the largest in the world, which has contributed \\nup to one-third of Mobil's profits for years but is beginning to run \\ndown. The field, in production since 1977, supplies liquefied natural \\ngas to Japan and Korea. Although Mobil under Noto has moved quickly \\nto cut costs and muscle its way into promising new areas such as Kazakhstan, \\nwhere it is a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz \\noil field, the payoff from such ventures is many years away. Other \\ncompanies face similar strains. ``The challenge is to replace their \\ncrown jewels and grow in an increasingly competitive environment,'' \\nWest said. Noto has not been shy about sitting down with other companies \\nsuch as British Petroleum and Amoco this year to see if a combination \\nmade sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads a much stronger \\nand bigger company than Mobil, he has not been immune to the strains \\non the global petroleum business. Those strains intensified this year \\nwhen Russia's economic collapse raised the risks of Exxon's extensive \\nexploration venture in that country. Exxon has also been more of a \\nfollower than a leader in huge projects in the deep offshore fields, \\nwhere major finds have been made near West Africa and in the Gulf \\nof Mexico. \\n\\nExxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining \\ntheir business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday. \\nIt was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing. If the companies \\nwere to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of \\nrevenue. A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial \\nTimes of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks between Exxon, \\nwhose annual revenue exceeds that of General Electric Co., and Mobil, \\nthe No. 2 U.S. oil company, came as oil prices sank to their lowest \\nin almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger than Royal \\nDutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue. Financial \\nterms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday. Neither \\nExxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts of \\nJohn D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up by the \\nSupreme Court in 1911. Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New \\nJersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New \\nYork and Vacuum Oil. As oil prices have plummeted to levels last seen \\nin the mid-1980s, oil companies have been under pressure to cut costs. \\nExxon, which has a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which \\nhas a market value of $61.1 billion, both have histories of being \\nfiercely independent, and both have already cut back on staff and \\nmade themselves lean to survive even during a prolonged period of \\nlow oil prices. But this has been a particularly unsettling year for \\nthe oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil prices \\nwill recover soon. Consequently, chief executives of most oil companies \\nhave had to swallow their pride and look for suitable partners. This \\nsummer, British Petroleum announced an agreement to buy Amoco Corp. \\nfor $48.2 million, creating the world's third-largest oil company \\nand prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation. \\n``It showed that megamergers are doable,'' said Adam Sieminski, an \\nanalyst for BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that any combination \\nbetween Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has \\nbeen known for being a proud company that has said in the past that \\nit would not want to merge. Exxon, he added, is a ``well-run company \\nthat likes to grow its own businesses.'' He added that the heads of \\nboth companies, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which is based \\nin Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief \\nexecutive of Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., are different \\npersonalities. ``It will not be easy,'' he said of combining the two \\nfar-flung companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas \\nstations that overlap in the United States and Europe. ``If you offer \\nenough money you can make anything happen,'' he added. Both companies \\nare under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive \\nin the long term. Like other oil companies, they had hoped to quickly \\ntap into the vast reserves of Russia. Even though they were prepared \\nto spend billions, they have held back because of the political and \\neconomic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by Russian officials \\nand oil companies to give up control of vast fields. Thus they have \\nhad to fall back on exploration areas of their own such as the deep \\nwaters in the Gulf of Mexico as well as West Africa and parts of Asia. \\nSuch exploration is very expensive, and even when a big field is discovered, \\nplatforms costing $1 billion or more are required to bring the it \\ninto production. Oil prices have been under pressure for more than \\na year, falling more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level because \\nof growing inventories of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused \\nby the economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil for January \\ndelivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the \\nNew York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reached \\non June 15. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \\nand some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have tried to \\nstem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production. But those \\npledges have not always been honored, and rallies in the oil market \\nthis year have proven short-lived. OPEC members on Wednesday continued \\ntheir discussion on extending their production cutbacks, and an agreement \\nis expected as early as Thursday. In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce \\nproduction by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily \\nworld supply of 74 million barrels. The main result of that agreement \\nappears to have been to keep oil prices from falling below $10 a barrel. \\nWashington regulators said Wednesday that they had not been notified \\nabout the Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission is \\nstill reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco. An \\nExxon-Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months' worth \\nof scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of the \\nindustry the combined company would control. Analysts and investment \\nbankers were split about the logic of a potential deal. Some pointed \\nto difficulties that the companies could face if they were combined. \\n``If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger, the answer is probably \\nno,'' said Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., \\na small independent investment bank based in New York. ``It is hard \\nto say that there is anything in particular to gain.'' In particular, \\nMiller said, the two companies have enormous similarities in their \\ndomestic refining and marketing businesses. ``They really do overlap \\nquite a bit,'' he said. ``You really do wonder what is the benefit \\nof all that redundancy.'' Another investment banker in the energy \\nbusiness, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also questioned \\nthe rationale for the discussed merger. ``When you look at the BP-Amoco \\ndeal, you can rationalize it,'' the banker said. ``But none of those \\nreasons apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal.'' But Amy Jaffe, an energy research \\nanalyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said \\nthe combination of the two companies would be logical, in part because \\nit would give them greater influence in bidding for development projects \\nin the Middle East. ``This is a deal that makes sense,'' Ms. Jaffe \\nsaid. ``With this combined company, there is no project that would \\nbe too big.'' Ms. Jaffe said the proposed deal would provide each \\ncompany with assets in areas where it had little influence. ``There \\nare a lot of complementary assets where they are not redundant,'' \\nshe said. She said that Exxon, for example, has a strong presence \\nin Angola, while Mobil does not. And Mobil has significant assets \\nin the Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak. \\n\\nTimes are tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggles the mind to accept \\nthe notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, \\nas British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least \\nto consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing. Oil companies \\nof all stripes are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the \\nhigh capital costs of exploration. Given the exotic locales of the \\nmost promising untapped fields, it seems unlikely that exploration \\nwill get cheaper. And with West Texas crude trading at around $12 \\na barrel, it seems a safe bet that oil won't be selling for $100 a \\nbarrel by the turn of the century _ something analysts were predicting \\nduring the oil price run-up of the early 1980s.

In its citation, \\nthe Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that \\n``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually \\nenables us to apprehend an elusory reality.'' Saramago, 75, wrote \\nhis breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar and Blimunda.'' Perhaps \\nhis best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,'' in which the Iberian Peninsula \\nbreaks off from Europe for supernatural reasons and floats off into \\nthe Atlantic. That device allows him to comment ironically ``about \\nthe authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major \\nplayers in power politics.'' Saramago's exuberant imagination and \\nplayfulness have made him one of Portugal's most popular contemporary \\nnovelists, and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages. \\nIn ``Blindness,'' his most recent work to be translated into English, \\na nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind, and the \\naffliction quickly spreads through the country _ grim tale of social \\ncollapse. In 1991's ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' God \\nand the devli negotiate about evil, and Jesus tries to back out of \\nhis crucifixion. ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own \\nresonant style of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes \\ntradition in a way that in the current state of things can be described \\nas radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million \\nkronor (dlrs 978,000 prize). Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) \\nis the fourth consecutive European to win the prestigious prize, and \\nthe first laureate to write in Portuguese. He had long been seen as \\none of the strongest potential candidates for the prize and the frequent \\nmedia queries about his prospects contrasted with his quiet personality. \\n``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around smiling, \\nhugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The Associated Press \\nin a recent interview. ``I just write.'' Saramago on Thursday had \\nplanned to leave Frankfurt, Germany, _ where he was attending the \\ninternational book fair _ for his home in the Canary Islands. But \\nPortuguese state radio said he was taken off the plane before departure \\nand driven back to the fair, where a crowd wa waiting for him. The \\nliterature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish \\nindustrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have been awarded \\nsince 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started in 1969. According \\nto the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is to recognize \\nwriting that works ``in an ideal direction.'' How to interpret that \\nterm has been widely debated. The Nobel Prize over the years has been \\ngiven to writers with world-views stretching from the bleak futility \\nof Samuel Beckett's works to the vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor \\nLaxness. The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not \\nwork in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand \\nRussell. Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright \\nwhose work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political \\ncommentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, \\nas shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous. The Swedish Academy does \\nnot reveal who was nominated or who it considered on its shortlist. \\nNominations can be made by previous laureates, professors of history \\nand literature, members of the Academy and presidents of some national \\nauthors' organizations. The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be \\nannounced Oct. 12, the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the \\neconomics laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All \\nthe prize announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize \\nwhich is given in Oslo, Norway. All the prizes are presented on Dec. \\n10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. \\n\\nJose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature \\nrelatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won \\nhim a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers \\nin the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature \\nThursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. A tall, balding man \\nwhose large, tinted glasses often give him a mien of severity, Saramago \\nis the first Portuguese-language writer _ and one of the first card-carrying \\nCommunists _ to become a Nobel Literature laureate. He is also the \\nfourth successive European to win the prize, after Italy's Dario Fo \\nin 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska in 1996 and Ireland's Seamus \\nHeaney in 1995. In its citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy praised \\nSaramago ``who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion \\nand irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory \\nreality.'' Although Saramago discounts the influence of Latin American \\n``magical realism'' on his work, his novels often use the supernatural, \\nallegorical, paradoxical and irrational as ways of addressing complex \\nquestions of faith and existence. Many of his novels are set against \\na backdrop of political or historical events, but it is his unwavering \\nconcern for individual fate that gives his fiction its distinctive \\nvoice and independent character. His best-known books, all published \\nin the United States, are ``Baltasar and Blimunda,'' ``The Year of \\nthe Death of Ricardo Reis,'' ``The Stone Raft'' and ``The History \\nof the Siege of Lisbon.'' His latest book available in English, ``Blindness,'' \\nin which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind, \\nwas described as his ``symphonic new novel'' by Andrew Miller in The \\nNew York Times Book Review on Sunday. ``There is no cynicism and there \\nare no conclusions, just a clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment \\nof things as they are, a quality than can only honestly be termed \\nas wisdom,'' Miller, himself a novelist, wrote. ``We should be grateful \\nwhen it is handed to us in such generous measures.'' Saramago learned \\nof his award Thursday at Frankfurt airport, where he was preparing \\nto fly home via Madrid to Lanzarote in the Canary Islands after attending \\nthe Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier this week, he participated in a round-table \\nof Portuguese writers on the topic, ``Why I am still a Communist.'' \\nHe immediately returned to the fair where he was received with cheers \\nand bouquets of roses. ``I am personally very happy for myself,'' \\nhe said. ``I am also happy for my country.'' Later he told a news \\nconference: ``The Portuguese language had to wait 100 years for this. \\nThere have to be ways and means of protecting the language so that \\nit does not become a museum, but is something that is alive. The writer's \\nrole is to protect it and work with it.'' The award was also celebrated \\nin Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio described it as ``recognition \\nof Portuguese culture,'' while the local Communist leader, Carlos \\nCarvalho, saw it as a credit to his own party. ``As a member of our \\nparty,'' he noted solemnly, ``Saramago makes a great contribution \\nto our ideals and to the struggle for social change.'' The laureate's \\nfiction, though, is never overtly political. Saramago, whose body \\nof work includes poetry, essays, plays and a journal as well as 10 \\nnovels, is unusual for having emerged as a major literary figure only \\nat the age of 60. His novels have since been translated into 30 languages, \\nselling particularly well in Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany. \\nWhile he has not been well known in the United States, his novels \\nhave always been critically well received there. For all his late \\nblooming, though, Saramago long dreamed of becoming a writer. Born \\ninto a family of rural laborers and raised in Lisbon, he was forced \\nby poverty to leave school while a teen-ager and learn the trade of \\ncar mechanic. Yet he managed to publish a small novel at the age of \\n25. Later, he found work at a Lisbon publishing company, but the oppressive \\nand censorial atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discouraged him \\nfrom writing. It was only after Portugal's April 1974 revolution that \\nSaramago felt free to find his voice. A member of the Portuguese Communist \\nParty since 1969, he served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario \\nde Noticias, during an 18-month period when the left looked likely \\nto seize power in Portugal. But an anti-Communist backlash in November \\n1975 forced him out of the newspaper and he began translating French \\ntexts into Portuguese to make ends meet. In the late 1970s, he also \\nturned to novels, publishing three in succession in 1977, 1978 and \\n1980. But it was in 1982, with ``Baltasar and Blimunda'' (``Memorial \\ndo Convento'' in Portuguese), that he achieved his international breakthrough. \\n``This is a rich, multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same \\ntime has a historical, a social and an individual perspective,'' the \\nSwedish Academy noted Thursday. ``The insight and wealth of imagination \\nto which it gives expression is characteristic of Saramago's work \\nas a whole.'' Set in 18th-century Portugal during the Inquisition, \\nthe book tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran, Baltasar, \\nand a visionary, Blimunda, to escape to the heavens aboard a flying \\nmachine powered by human wills captured by the hypersensory Blimunda. \\nThis fantastic story takes place against the very real background \\nof the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousands \\nof men held in the grip of the Inquisition. When the novel was published \\nin the United States in 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed it as ``brilliant'' \\nin The New York Times Book Review. ``Mr. Saramago is constantly present \\nas a voice of European skepticism, a connoisseur of ironies,'' Howe \\nwrote. ``I think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility, \\ncaustic and shrewd.'' In his next novel, ``The Year of the Death of \\nRicardo Reis,'' which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet \\nFernando Pessoa, who appears in it as a ghost, Saramago sets his story \\nin the early years of the Salazar dictatorship, with the tale following \\nthe romantic and sexual misadventures of a poet-physician. Writing \\nin The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called it ``a rare, old-fashioned \\nnovel _ at once lyrical, symbolic and meditative.'' Saramago, whose \\nsense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation \\nand conflicting use of tenses, sought a different form of freedom \\nin ``The Stone Raft,'' where he imagines the confusion unleashed when \\nthe Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free from the rest of Europe \\nand begins drifting toward the New World and threatens to collide \\nwith the Azores. To the delight of Britons, Gibraltar is left behind. \\nUnsurprisingly, the bitter satire, ``The Gospel According to Jesus \\nChrist,'' proved controversial, with God shown as using the innocently \\nhuman Jesus to create a religion that has spawned violence and intolerance. \\nWhen a Lisbon jury picked the book as Portugal's entry for a 1992 \\nEuropean literary prize, the country's conservative government vetoed \\nthe choice as blasphemous. It was then that Saramago decided to leave \\nhis small, crowded apartment in Lisbon for the relative solitude of \\nLanzarote. ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' published in the \\nUnited States last year, is a whimsical tale set in motion by the \\ndecision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the \\nword ``not'' into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal. \\nWith this ``lunatic creative act,'' as Edmund White put it in The \\nNew York Times Book Review, he ``totally derails the national saga'' \\nby affirming that the crusaders did not in fact help liberate 12th-century \\nLisbon from Moorish occupation. White ended his July 1997 review with \\na prescient remark. ``Word has it that Saramago is overdue for a Nobel \\nPrize,'' he noted. ``No candidate has a better claim to lasting recognition \\nthan this novelist.'' With the recent publication of ``Blindness'' \\nin the United States, only Saramago's latest novel, ``Todos os Nomes,'' \\nor ``All the Names'' still awaits translation into English. In the \\ntradition of Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he has now embarked \\non his journals. The fourth volume of these ``Cadernos de Lanzarote'' \\nwas just published in Lisbon. Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, \\nworth the equivalent of $967,500 this year, at a ceremony in Stockholm \\non Dec. 10. \\n\\nThere's room for a few more names on a 20th century honor roll of \\nwriters, and one will be added this week when the Swedish Academy \\nannounces the latest Nobel Literature laureate. Who is chosen and \\nwhy stimulates animated conversation with readers as well as academics, \\ncritics and the authors themselves. This year's winner _ or, possibly, \\nwinners _ will be announced Thursday, the Academy disclosed Tuesday. \\n``The joke you hear is that it goes to people you never heard of,'' \\nsaid Ian Jack, editor of London-based Granta literary magazine. But \\nthe Nobel, awarded most every year since 1901, also shines a light, \\nusually deservedly, on wonderful writers few people have read, he \\nadded. His favorites include Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul, though he's \\nconvinced Naipaul probably won't win because of his ``dark ... pessimistic'' \\nand often scathing portrayals of post-colonial African culture. The \\nacademy keeps its deliberations secret. Who is considered seriously, \\neven who's nominated, isn't disclosed. A writer's nationality, by \\nthe terms of the prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, is supposed to \\nbe irrelevant. Two can share the prize, though the last time that \\nhappened was 1974. Winners are expected to personally receive it: \\nawards are not given posthumously. Looking at the process from afar, \\nHarold Bloom, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, \\nsaid the award committee has an unsettling record of selections that \\nare ``nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.''' The winners \\nlist is prestigious, he concedes, but by no means uniformly lustrous. \\n``Absolutely not! Outrageously not,'' he said in a telephone interview \\nfrom New York. ``They include all kinds of fifth-raters. ... James \\nJoyce never got one, for heaven's sake. Neither did Marcel Proust.'' \\nBloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author of ``Blood \\nMeridian''; Philip Roth, author of ``American Pastoral''; and John \\nAshbery, ``the best living poet.'' A review of recent winners may \\nforeshadow this year's laureate. Seven of the past 10 were men _ does \\nthat favor a woman? Two of the past three were poets _ does that favor \\na prose writer? Four of the past 10 wrote in English, and the last \\nthree laureates are European. In comparison, only three Asian writers \\nhave ever won. ``Bei Dao is a personal favorite of mine,'' said Abe \\nHarumasa, editor-in-chief of the Japanese literary magazine Bungei. \\n``The choice could be interpreted as being motivated partly by politics,'' \\ngiven the poet's association with China's democracy movement, ``but \\nit's clear he's a wonderful poet.'' Minoru Takeuchi, a professor of \\nChinese literature at Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cited \\nnovelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin as worthy. The latter is known for \\nher portrayals of the struggles of Chinese women. China, which translates \\nand publishes the works of many Nobel winners, ``desperately'' wants \\nits first laureate, he added. Spain's Nobel hopes are pinned on Francisco \\nAyala, 92, winner of this year's renowned Prince of Asturias prize, \\nsaid Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, an author, university professor \\nand secretary of the jury that selected Ayala. Other presumed Latin \\ncandidates are Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, a member of the 200-year-old \\nRoyal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's \\nJose Saramago, whose works have been translated into more than 20 \\nlanguages. For his part, Saramago, 75, said in a recent Associated \\nPress interview that he's weary of speculation that this year, once \\nagain, he might win. ``Let's not get into that,'' he said. ``I just \\nwrite.'' \\n\\nThree American pharmacologists were awarded the Nobel Prize on Monday \\nfor their surprising discoveries of how natural production of a gas, \\nnitric oxide, can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions. Those \\ninclude widening blood vessels, helping to regulate blood pressure, \\ninitiating erections, battling infections, preventing formation of \\nblood clots and acting as a signal molecule in the nervous system. \\nThe prize, for physiology or medicine, went to Dr. Robert Furchgott, \\n82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, \\n57, of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid \\nMurad, 62, of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The \\nannouncement of a significant phase of the discoveries by two of Monday's \\nwinners at a meeting in 1986 ``elicited an avalanche of research activities \\nin many different laboratories around the world,'' said the Nobel \\ncommittee at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which makes the \\nawards. Its citation said that the research had led to new treatments \\nfor treating heart and lung diseases, shock and impotence. Ignarro \\n``discovered the principle that led to the use of Viagra as an anti-impotency \\ndrug,'' said Dr. Sten Orrenius, a professor of toxicology at the Karolinska \\nInstitute. Nitric oxide starts the process by which blood vessels \\nin the penis widen to produce an erection. Nitric oxide, a chemical \\nrelative of the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, is better known as a \\ncommon air pollutant formed when nitrogen burns, such as in automobile \\nexhaust fumes. But scientists now know it is distributed widely in \\nthe body. The discoveries honored on Monday were made largely during \\nthe 1980s at a time when scientists knew that bacteria produced nitric \\noxide but did not think it was important in animals and humans. The \\naward committee said that ``this was the first discovery that a gas \\ncan act as a signal molecule in the organism.'' The discovery was \\nstartling because ``nitric oxide is totally different from any other \\nknown signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted to nitrate \\nand nitrite within 10 seconds.'' Recipients of the Nobel Prize, including \\nsome who have lobbied for it for years, often profess surprise on \\nlearning of their award. This year's winners were refreshingly candid. \\nFurchgott said he had planned to sleep late on Monday, a holiday, \\nbut was awakened at 5:30 at his home in Hewlett, N.Y. He said that \\nhe knew that previous Nobel prize winners had nominated him for the \\naward, but that he still was ``somewhat surprised'' to receive it. \\n``I guess I had some good friends voting,'' Furchgott said. He said \\nhe could not get back to sleep. Murad said he had ``pondered the odds \\nand thought that maybe I could win the prize, if not now maybe in \\na couple of years.'' He described the award as the culmination of \\na career and said that ``when it happens, it's incredible.'' Ignarro \\nwas traveling in Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, the dean of UCLA, said ``we \\nactually anticipated this day for about four years now.'' The three \\n1998 winners never worked together, ``but we talked a lot of shop \\ntalk at meetings,'' Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, the president \\nof the American Heart Association and the head of cardiology at Mt. \\nSinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that ``the discovery of nitric oxide \\nand its function is one of the most important in the history of cardiovascular \\nmedicine.'' Doctors have learned from the prize-winning research that \\nin heart disease, the endothelium, or inner lining of arteries, makes \\nless nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, can help replenish \\nstores of nitric oxide. Now, drug companies are trying to develop \\nmore powerful heart drugs based on newer knowledge of nitric oxide's \\nrole as a signal molecule. Researchers have also learned that nitric \\noxide produced in the endothelium rapidly spreads through cell membranes \\nto the underlying muscle cells in arteries. Then it can shut off muscle \\ncontractions in the arteries, thus widening them and reducing blood \\npressure. Inhalation of nitric oxide gas has saved the lives of some \\npeople with certain lung diseases, particularly infants who have developed \\ndangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating the amount \\nof nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much can be lethal. \\nNitric oxide plays a harmful role in the collapse of the circulatory \\nsystem, or shock, resulting from overwhelming microbial infections. \\nBacteria can release products that cause white blood cells to release \\nenormous amounts of nitric oxide. As a result, blood pressure drops. \\nScientists are trying to develop drugs that can block production of \\nnitric oxide in such infections. White blood cells also play a role \\nin attacking cancerous cells. The gas can also induce a type of programmed \\ncell death known as apoptosis. Scientists are studying nitric oxide's \\neffects on the immune system to stop the growth of cancers. They are \\nalso exploring nitric oxide's possible role in regulating body temperature. \\nDoctors are measuring the production of nitric oxide in the lungs \\nand intestines to diagnose a number of ailments, including asthma \\nand colitis, and are studying its role in menstruation. Nitric oxide \\nformed in nerve cells spreads rapidly in all directions to activate \\ncells in the vicinity and influence many functions, like behavior \\nand the mobility of the intestinal tract. Nitric oxide is also being \\nstudied for its role in smell and memory. Nitric oxide's role is still \\nunfolding; scientists have written thousands of scientific papers \\nabout it in recent years and have started a journal, Nitric Oxide. \\nThe Nobel committee cited Furchgott for performing in 1980 ``an ingenious \\nexperiment'' that showed that a drug, acetylcholine, widened blood \\nvessels only if the inner layer, or endothelium, was intact. Furchgott \\nconcluded that blood vessels widen because the endothelial cells produce \\na signal molecule that he called EDRF, for endothelium-derived relaxing \\nfactor, which relaxes smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. Furchgott's \\nfindings ``led to a quest to identify the factor,'' the citation said. \\n(OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation did not refer to an accident \\nin Furchgott's laboratory that played a major role in his discoveries. \\nIn 1995, in the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott \\nwrote that on May 5, 1978, in the first of a series of planned experiments \\non arteries from a rabbit, a technician did not follow directions \\ncorrectly. The technician performed one step of the experiment before \\ninstead of after he was supposed to wash out a drug used in an earlier \\nphase of the experiment. Furchgott expected that the arteries would \\ncontract. Instead, they relaxed. It was the first time he had seen \\nthe drugs under study produce such a reaction, and he used the insight \\nto plan additional experiments. Furchgott omitted the technician's \\nname in that paper and in another in 1996 in the Journal of the American \\nMedical Association. On Monday, he said David Davidson was the technician. \\n(OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cited Ignarro for concluding \\nin 1986, from ``a brilliant series of analyses'' conducted independently \\nof Furchgott, that EDRF was identical to nitric oxide. Furchgott said \\nhe and Ignarro made the announcement at the same symposium in 1986 \\nat the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., but the papers were not published \\nuntil 1998. Murad was cited for work conducted over the years while \\nhe worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Stanford \\nUniversity in Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories in Illinois. \\nMurad said he felt fortunate to have heard Furchgott report his early \\nwork on EDRF in 1980. Murad showed that a gas could regulate important \\ncellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart \\ndrugs led to the release of nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN \\nHERE) In his early training at Case Western Reserve University in \\nCleveland, Murad worked in the laboratory of Dr. Theodore Rall, who \\nalso trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman of the \\nUniversity of Texas Southwestern in Dallas. Gilman said in an interview \\nthat he believed Rall, now retired and living in Charlottesville, \\nVa., was the first scientist to have trained two Nobel Prize winners. \\nIn addition, Rall worked with Dr. Earl Sutherland, who also won a \\nNobel Prize. In his early reseach years, Murad worked on a chemical \\nknown as cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out to \\nbe critical in the nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees referred to \\nthe early work as ``dumping experiments'' because all they could do \\nin the laboratory at the time was crudely add various hormones and \\nagents to slices of tissue, cell cultures. It took years to develop \\nthe more refined techniques that led to the understanding of nitric \\noxide's many roles in the body. But for many years, most of the scientific \\ncommunity was skeptical of the ability of a free radical like nitric \\noxide to activate an enzyme, Murad said in 1996 when he and Furchgott \\nshared the Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM \\nENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes were created by the will of Alfred Nobel, \\nwhose invention of dynamite involved the use of nitroglycerine. The \\naward committee noted an odd twist to this year's award. When Nobel \\ndeveloped chest pain from heart disease, it said, he refused to take \\nthe nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it caused \\nheadache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit in the relief of \\nchest pain. Nobel died in 1896. The prize that the three scientists \\nwill share is now worth $938,000. \\n\\nJose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel \\nPrize for Literature on Thursday. His personal delight was seconded \\nby a burst of public elation in his homeland. Saramago, 75, and Portuguese \\nsaid they were pleased the Swedish Academy had finally acknowledged \\nthe literary contribution of Portugal, a small country of 10 million \\npeople bordering Spain on Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula. \\n``It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese \\nlanguage,'' Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking through \\nan interpreter. Saramago, a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged \\nand iconoclastic views, said he shared the honor with his country \\nand he hoped winning the prize would make Portugal and its language \\n``more visible and audible.'' ``I'm personally very happy for myself. \\nI'm also happy for my country,'' he said at the Frankfurt Book Fair \\nin Germany where he was engulfed by well-wishers offering roses. Back \\nhome, President Jorge Sampaio said the award was a cause for ``great \\ncollective satisfaction.'' Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said the \\naward was ``above all a prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language'' \\nwhich is spoken by 180 million worldwide, mostly in Brazil, but also \\nin Portugal's five former colonies in Africa. Saramago's controversial \\nopinions and atheistic outlook have frequently clashed with the establishment \\nand the general public. Even on the day he won the prize, the Vatican \\nnewspaper L'Osservatore Romano attacked the Swedish Academy's choice, \\ndescribing Saramago as an ``old-school communist'' who had a ``substantially \\nantireligious vision.'' Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara was so \\nupset by one of Saramago's novels in 1992 that he withdrew his name \\nfrom Portugal's nominees for the European Literature Prize. At the \\ntime, Lara said Saramago's 1991 novel ``O Evangelho Segundo Jesus \\nCristo'' (The Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's \\nRoman Catholic religious convictions and divided the country. The \\nbook describes a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with \\nMary Magdalene and tries to back out of his crucifixion. ``I have \\nnot come to bring peace but the sword,'' said Saramago, an atheist, \\nat the time. He retreated in disgust with his Spanish wife, Pilar \\ndel Rio, to his home in Lanzarote in Spain's Canary Islands. He has \\nnever courted the kind of fame offered by literary prizes, and his \\nbluntness can sometimes offend. ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't \\ngush, I don't go around smiling, hugging people and trying to make \\nfriends,'' he once said. A gaunt man with wisps of white hair, Saramago \\nwas born in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon. From a poor family, \\nhe never finished university but continued to study part-time while \\nsupporting himself as a metalworker. His first novel, published in \\n1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or ``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of \\npeasants in moral crisis. It sold badly but won enough recognition \\nto propel him from the welder's shop to a literary magazine. But for \\nthe next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year conservative \\ndictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few travel and poetry \\nbooks while he worked as a journalist. He returned to fiction only \\nafter Salazar's regime was toppled by a military uprising in 1974. \\nSince the 1980s, he has been one of Portugal's best-selling contemporary \\nwriters and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages. \\nHe first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical fantasy \\n``Memorial do Convento,'' published in English in 1988 as ``Baltasar \\nand Blimunda.'' It is set during the Catholic-inspired inquisition \\nand explores the war between individuals and organized religion, picking \\nup Saramago's recurring theme of the loner struggling against authority. \\nHe is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia \\nMarquez because his prose is often rooted in recognizable settings \\nbut at the same time tinged with magical elements. The Nobel citation \\npraised his work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion \\nand irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.'' \\nSaramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper \\nand radio commentaries, though his views are always inspired by his \\ndeep concern for his fellow man. ``Blindness,'' his most recent book \\nto be translated into English, is an unsettling allegory about the \\nsocial meltdown as an inexplicable blindness sweeps through society. \\n``This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of rationality,'' \\nhe said. ``We're rational beings but we don't behave rationally. If \\nwe did, there'd be no starvation in the world.'' In the 1989 ``The \\nHistory of the Siege of Lisbon,'' a Lisbon proofreader mischievously \\ninserts the word ``not'' into a text on the 12th century capture of \\nthe Portuguese capital from the Moors, thereby fictionally altering \\nthe course of European history with a stroke of his pen. Such historical \\nand literary mischief are Saramago trademarks. In his 1986 book, ``The \\nStone Raft,'' the Iberian Peninsula snaps off from the rest of the \\nEuropean continent and floats off into the North Atlantic _ apparently \\nin a metaphorical search for identity away from the standardizing \\nnature of the European Union, of which Portugal and Spain are enthusiastic \\nmembers. Saramago will receive the dlrs 978,000 prize on Dec. 10 in \\nStockholm. \\n\\nA day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist \\nJose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award, \\nit could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers. \\n``I'm not the only one who deserved it'', said the first Portuguese-language \\nauthor to obtain the prestigious award. ``There have been other Portuguse \\nauthors, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels'' \\nSpeaking at a packed press coference in Madrid, Saramago joked about \\nhow he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess at Frankfurt \\nairport as he waited for a flight home to Spain's Canary Islands. \\nThe news left the 75-year-old writer no choice but to leave the airport \\nand return to the city's book fair to meet the press and public. ``At \\nthat moment I was over the moon and returning to the book fair the \\nonly thing I was worried about was that the whole thing was an error,'' \\nsaid Saramago. Dismissing the Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday \\nof his achievment, Saramago, a known atheist, quipped that he was \\naware that ``the Pope had been among the jury, I wouldn't have won \\nthe prize.'' ``The Vatican is easily upset'', said Saramago, ``I think \\nthat the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers and leave people \\nalone''. Meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled to arrive \\non Tuesday, the delight at the Swedish Academy's award for Saramago \\nwas reflected in the daily papers, with even the country's three daily \\nsports papers ample space to the event. The two leading dailies, Publico \\nand Diario de Noticias, gave over their entire front pages to Saramago. \\nLisbon City Hall rushed out posters saying ``Congratulations Jose \\nSaramago'' which were hung up around the capital during the night. \\nSaramago was born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a small \\ntown near Lisbon. He never finished university but continued to study \\npart-time while supporting himself as a metalworker. ``Nothing in \\nmy life would have led one to think I'd win the Nobel Prize'', said \\nSaramago. ``I wasn't born to win the Nobel. I didn't have my own books \\nuntil I was 18.'' His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do \\nPecado,'' or ``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral \\ncrisis. For the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the \\n41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only \\na few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist. He \\nreturned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled by a military \\nuprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, his works have been translated \\ninto more than 20 languages. Regarding the future, Saramago said the \\nbook he is currently working on will be called ``The Cavern'' and \\ndeals with a modern version of myth of Plato and the cave. \\n\\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who seems a perennial Nobel Peace \\nPrize also-ran, could have won the coveted honor in 1978 had it not \\nbeen for strict deadline rules for nominations. That prize was shared \\nby Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem \\nBegin for signing the Camp David peace accords. However, the five-member \\nNorwegian awards committee also wanted to honor Carter for brokering \\nthe pact, only to be foiled by their own rules. ``The Nobel committee \\nwanted to give the prize to all three,'' said Geir Lundestad, the \\ncurrent committee's nonvoting secretary, said on Sunday. ``But Carter \\nhad not been nominated when the deadline ran out.'' Nominations postmarked \\nby Feb. 1 are accepted for that year's prize. The committee can add \\nit own nominations at its first meeting of the year, usually in early \\nMarch. The Camp David accords were not signed until Sept. 17, 1978, \\nabout five weeks before that year's peace prize was annouCkuld not \\ngive him the prize, the Norwegian committee recognized in the 1978 \\nawards citation ``the positive initiative taken by President Jimmy \\nCarter.'' Lundestad said the committee, which works in deep secrecy \\nin its five or six meetings a year, tried to find a loophole in the \\nrules, which are overseen by the Swedish Nobel Foundation. The Nobel \\nPrizes were endowed by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist whose \\n355 inventions included dynamite. In his 1895 will, Nobel endowed \\nthe prizes, and said the peace prize should be picked by a Norwegian \\ncommittee and the rest by Swedish institutions. Lundestad said the \\ncommittee turned to the Swedish Nobel Foundation for advice on Carter \\nbecause it was a question of principle. Stig Ramel, a Swede who was \\nthen director of the Nobel Foundation, advised against breaking the \\nrules, Lundestad said by telephone. Normally, the committee refuses \\nto discuss past candidates in keeping with a strict policy of secrecy \\nin which selection details are sealed for 50 years. Lundestad made \\nan exception because Ramel revealed the Carter dilemma in his 1994 \\nmemoirs. Carter has repeatedly been nominated for the Nobel prize \\nfor his consistent and wide-ranging peace efforts. He is also among \\nthe 139 candidates for the prize being announced in Oslo on Friday. \\nHowever, early speculation leans more toward someone involved in the \\nNorthern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel to mark \\nthe 30th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of his country, or a human \\nrights activist to mark the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Human Rights \\nCharter. While the committee wanted to honor Carter and could not, \\nwith hindsight some regretted the prize for other reasons. Four years \\nafter Begin won the prize, the Israeli prime minister ordered an invasion \\nof southern Lebanon in which thousands of civilians died. Kare Kristiansen, \\nwho served on the peace prize committee from 1991 to 1994, once said \\nthat, had the committee waited, Begin probably would not have won. \\n\\nRobert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United \\nStates on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize. They were given the \\nprize for their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling \\nmolecule in the cardiovascular system, according to the citiation \\nfrom the Karolinska lnstitute. Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the \\nState University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University \\nof California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas \\nMedical School in Houston. The citation said ``it was a senation that \\nthe simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when \\nnitrogen burns ... could exert important functions in the organism. \\n'' Because of the research, ``we know today that nitric oxide acts \\nas a signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against infections \\nand as a regulator of blood pressure.'' The prize amount of 7.6 million \\nkronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally among the three. Last year, \\nthe prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California \\nat San Francisco for his discovery of prions, the rogue proteins identified \\nas causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't known outside \\nthe medical community, although the list of laureates contains a few \\nfamiliar names including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert \\nKoch, and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, \\nthey are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small on \\npaper but carry large consequences. Among other well-known names to \\nreceive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize \\nin 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS \\nresearchers. Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield \\nmay not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 \\nis a term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or \\nCAT scan. The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be \\nannounced this year. Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese \\nnovelist Jose Saramago. The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced \\nTuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. \\nAll the announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize \\nwhich is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, \\nthe anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and \\ninventor of dynamite whose will established the prizes. \\n\\nWhen Alfred Nobel wrote the directions establishing a literature prize \\nin his name, he chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letters. \\nQuestions about the prize have engaged and piqued the literary world \\never since. A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, \\nwhen the Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's \\nmost prestigious prize for writers. The prize focuses intense media \\nattention on the Swedish capital and the clamor of journalists generally \\ndrowns out a question: Why does the world care so much about the literary \\nchoices of a handful of people in a quiet and remote country? Does \\nthe Nobel Prize really recognize the best? When asked that question, \\nSwedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said ``Look \\nat the list of prizewinners!'' The answer obscures as much as it clarifies. \\nOn one hand, the Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers \\nsuch as Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders to \\nlight, such as Wislawa Szymborska. But the prize arguably also has \\nhonored the mediocre, heaping attention on those who would have been \\nmore fairly served by obscurity. Among them is the winner of the first \\nprize in 1901, Sully Prudhomme. That choice was denounced by Sweden's \\nleading literary light, August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes sent \\na letter to Leo Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy's slight in not \\nchoosing him. Arguments over the Academy's choices are inevitable, \\nconsidering the instructions they were given. Nobel's will says the \\nprize should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.'' \\nWhat, exactly, he meant by ``ideal** is unclear and the Academy's \\nchoices have reflected the confusion. The Academy has chosen to interpret \\nthe word to apply to works ranging from the good-hearted charm of \\nSzymborska's poetry to the crushing hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's \\nwritings. When Nobel wrote the word ``ideal'' _ in Swedish ``idealisk** \\n_ he superimposed the last couple of letters over previous one. Allen \\nwas so curious to understand Nobel's thoughts that he engaged a forensic \\nexpert to try to find out what the earlier letters were. The expert \\nsucceeded _ to a point. He found that the first word Nobel wrote was \\n``idealirad,'' a word that doesn't exist. Despite the inclarity around \\nthe edges, Allen said he is confident that the Academy's choices bolster \\nNobel's core idea that ``literature would be the basis for some kind \\nof progress.'' About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: \\nthe Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret. But observers \\nlove to speculate on who might win, even who's on the shortlist for \\nthe prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). \\nNames that freuqently come up in the guessing include V.S. Naipaul, \\nChina's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, and Jose Saramago \\nof Portugal. \\n\\nThree American researchers on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize \\nfor discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the \\ncardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applications ranging from \\nhardening of the arteries to impotence. The prestigious prize went \\nto Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott \\nis a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, \\nIgnarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at \\nthe University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The citation by \\nthe Karolinska Institute said ``it was a senation that the simple, \\ncommon air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen \\nburns ... could exert important functions in the organism. '' Because \\nof the research, ``we know today that nitric oxide acts as a signal \\nmolecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against infections and \\nas a regulator of blood pressure.'' ``Signal transmission by a gas \\nthat is produced by one cell, penetrates through membranes and regulates \\nthe function of another cell represents an entirely new principle,'' \\nthe citation said. Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signals \\nhas sparked research on a wide range of new drugs, including those \\nthat can be used in the treatment of heart problems, artherosclerosis, \\nshock and impotence. The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs \\n978,000) is divided equally among the three. Last year, the prize \\nwent to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California at San \\nFrancisco for his discovery of prions, the rogue proteins identified \\nas causing Mad Cow Disease.

Both presidents have hinted they might not attend the \\nmeeting of the 18 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations next month \\nin the Malaysian capital out of concern for Anwar. The former deputy \\nprime minister and finance minister of Malaysia was arrested Sept. \\n20 on corruption and illegal sex charges, then brought to court with \\na black eye and bruises. Philippine President Joseph Estrada told \\nbusiness and political leaders in Singapore on Tuesday that he had \\nnot made up his mind. Estrada called Anwar his friend and said, ``I \\nthink all of us here believe that due process and human rights should \\nbe respected.'' Indonesian President B.J. Habibie may also stay away, \\nhis foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said after the two new Southeast \\nAsian leaders held a half-hour private meeting. If Habibie passes \\nup APEC, Alatas said, it will be because ``he has difficulty leaving \\nthe country while there is no vice president, while there are so many \\nproblems to deal with.'' Habibie has already canceled a state visit \\nto Malaysia, citing difficulties at home. The meeting was delayed \\nfor almost 90 minutes when a mechanical fault was discovered in one \\nof two Indonesian helicopters that were to have flown Estrada and \\nhis entourage through heavy rain from Singapore. A ferry was chartered \\nfor the 45-minute sea journey. Habibie apologized when Estrada finally \\narrived at the Melia Panorama Hotel. Estrada replied, ``That's all \\nright.'' The two men, who have each been in power less than five months, \\nmet alois June 30 inaugural speech to give the underclass a fairer \\nshare of the country's wealth. Habibie took office May 21, hours after \\nhis predecessor and mentor, Suharto, was forced from power after national \\nprotests and street riots over Indonesia's collapsing economy. \\n\\nA group of high-powered U.S. investors in Southeast Asia on Monday \\napplauded efforts to perk up Thailand's staggering economy, saying \\nthey had been assured by top Thai officials that key economic reform \\npackages will soon be approved. After meetings with Thai Cabinet members, \\nincluding Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, members of the U.S.-ASEAN \\nBusiness Council said they were confident in the future of Thailand's \\neconomy and promised their companies would continue to invest here \\nand elsewhere in the region. ``We would be quick as observers to applaud \\nthe aggressiveness of the reform packages that we see being proposed \\nin front of your government today,'' said business council chairman \\nGeorge David, who is also chairman and CEO of United Technologies \\nCorp. Thailand was hit hard by last year's Asian economic crisis, \\nand the proposed economic reform legislation focuses on resolving \\nthe massive bad debt of private companies, which is hindering a recovery. \\n``This is very aggressive, good reform. It's very impressive,'' David \\nsaid, adding that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda promised \\nParliament would pass reform measures in ``months, not years.'' The \\nU.S.-ASEAN Business Council is a private organization comprising about \\n300 U.S. companies with substantial investments in Southeast Asia. \\nDavid said the five executives in the delegation represented dlrs \\n300 billion in assets. The council's lobbying efforts with the U.S. \\nand Southeast Asian governments have concentrated on removing tariffs \\nand other barriers to overseas trade. The delegation will travel to \\nKuala Lumpur for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov. \\n14-18. David said free trade should be a focus of discussions among \\nthe government leaders attending. ``What I hope they will say at APEC \\nis a very strong affirmation of the free-trade agenda and a very strong \\naffirmation of the foreign direct investment agenda,'' he added. \\n\\nIndonesian President B.J. Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific \\nleaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of \\nMalaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported \\nSunday. Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia \\nfor an annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph \\nEstrada said he was considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic \\nCooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. ``I'm very concerned \\nover how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been treated,'' Habibie was quoted \\nas saying by the English-language newspaper The Nation. ``I'm concerned \\nbecause people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed \\na lot for the benefit of his country.'' Anwar is a charismatic politician \\nwho was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving \\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he was suddenly fired by Mahathir \\non Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then began \\nspeaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. Anwar has \\nbeen accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia \\nlaw, but the charges are generally seen as a pretext for his political \\npersecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised \\nand he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international \\nattention to his case. ``Because of human rights involved _ and I \\nthink it is universal _ people should be given the chance to defend \\nthemselves,'' Habibie was quoted as saying in the interview conducted \\nSaturday. ``People should not be tortured.'' Habibie said Anwar's \\ndismissal should not have been based ``on things which had not been \\nproven.'' On attending the APEC meeting, he said, ``It's difficult \\nfor me.'' But he said he would consult parliament, adding, ``I'm not \\ncoming personally but as the president of 211 million people of Indonesia.'' \\nLike Estrada, Habibie served as his country's vice president when \\nAnwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts on the international \\naffairs circuit. \\n\\nIn little more than a week, the world's leaders will converge on this \\nbusinesslike city in the heart of Southeast Asia for the annual meeting \\nof the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They could hardly \\nbe meeting in a more provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued \\ntrading in its currency, the ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls \\non the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets, particularly \\non investment from overseas. In doing so, the Malaysian prime minister, \\nMahathir Mohamad, in effect slammed the door on the global economy \\nthat President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion. \\nMahathir's decision drew jeers from international investors and policy- \\nmakers, who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would \\nretard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out \\nwhen Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise. Now, though, \\nMahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate \\nthat capital controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund \\neconomy. Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly in September, and \\nthere is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again. \\n``It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls, \\nthe economy has improved,'' said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director \\nof the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research \\norganization here that helped draft the policies. ``But we want to \\nsee whether this is strongly sustainable.'' Critics said it was predictable \\nthat capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy. \\nBecause the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows \\nand currency fluctuations, they said, the government had been able \\nto ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending. Still, the \\nmere fact that Malaysia's experiment has yielded some positive results \\nguarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting. With \\nMahathir leading the campaign, the cause of capital controls will \\nhave a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin \\nof Westerners. ``Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader,'' \\nsaid Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore. ``There is \\nno way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to \\nmuzzle him,'' he added, referring to President Jiang of China. Policy-makers \\nin the United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia's gambit \\nis seen as successful, other economically weakened countries in the \\nregion, like Indonesia, might be tempted to try it. So far, Indonesian \\nofficials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised \\nby the International Monetary Fund, which stresses economic austerity \\nand open markets. But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy \\nfor Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts \\nInstitute of Technology, has advocated using them as an emergency \\nmeasure. Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia's contention \\nthat it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial \\nsystem. He said the recent near-collapse of a prominent American hedge \\nfund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive \\nconsequences. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based in \\nGreenwich, Conn., was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on \\nTreasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted \\na flight of capital out of that country. ``The LTCM fiasco really \\nprovides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy,'' \\nYusof said. With capital controls as protection, Yusof said Malaysia \\nwas picking up the pieces of its shattered economy. In addition to \\ngrowing foreign reserves, he said Malaysia had improved its trade \\nbalance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods. Foreign investors \\nhave also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, as experts had predicted \\nthey would. While foreign direct investment fell in September _ to \\n$142 million, from an average monthly rate of $321 million for the \\nperiod from January through September _ it did not dry up completely. \\nFor every comforting statistic, though, the critics produce an alarming \\none. They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves was merely \\ndue to the new capital restrictions, which stipulated that Malaysian \\ncurrency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated \\nby Sept. 30. The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in \\nSeptember, despite several reductions in interest rates. So the consumers \\nwho are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into \\ntheir savings, which means the buying spree will end when their savings \\nare depleted. ``The argument was that by imposing capital controls, \\nyou'd regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the \\nsupply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch,'' said K.S. Jomo, \\na professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here. \\n``But that's not happening.'' The biggest flaw in Malaysia's policy, \\nJomo and others said, is its timing. With the Asian crisis more than \\na year old, much of the foreign capital that was in the country has \\nalready gone. The critics said Mahathir had spooked would-be investors \\nwithout even locking in the ones who used to be here. ``There is a \\ncase to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls, \\nbut to avert a crisis, not to respond to one,'' Jomo said. In fact, \\nother Asian currencies, like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht, \\nhave actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency \\nand fixed the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar. Analysts \\nliken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that \\nhas come and gone. More important, the capital controls are slowing \\ndown much-needed corporate and banking reforms. The government's rescue \\nof Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, is going \\nahead, though some analysts predict the government will eventually \\nscrap the much-criticized plan. The rescue of politically connected \\ncompanies remains a tense issue here. On Monday, during the trial \\nof Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges \\nof corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's \\nclaim that he had approved the bailout. Anwar's sensational trial \\nis a reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangled \\nfrom politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed with \\nhis former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis, and he \\ndismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital controls. During boom \\ntimes, Mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti-foreigner \\nlanguage. In a speech on Monday, he attacked a familiar target, saying \\nforeign currency traders ``are the cause of the currency turmoil,'' \\nadding: ``They spread it worldwide. They precipitated the current \\nrecession in every country.'' But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar has \\nstirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia. With \\nprotesters chanting for reform on the usually orderly streets of this \\ncity, experts said Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order \\nto soothe the country's agitated population. ``Things will heat up \\nif the economy does not improve,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor \\nof political science at the University of Malaya. ``Then the whole \\nquestion of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue.'' In \\nthat regard, at least, the leaders who converge on Kuala Lumpur in \\ntwo weeks will be able to identify with their embattled host. \\n\\nThe Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said Friday he was summoned \\nto the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president's statements \\nin support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim. Ambassador Jose Brillantes \\nsaid in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he was called Thursday \\nafter the Malaysian dissident's eldest daughter met Philippine President \\nJoseph Estrada. ``They expressed their concern about what's happening \\nand the statements coming out of the Philippines,'' Brillantes told \\nradio station DZXL in Manila. Brillantes said he explained that following \\nthe 1986 ``people power'' revolt against the late dictator Ferdinand \\nMarcos, Filipinos' react ``strongly'' to ``real and perceived violations \\nof human rights.'' ``I just explained our culture to them,'' he said. \\nAnwar was fired as deputy premier in September and later arrested, \\nappearing in court with a black eye, bruises and a neck brace. He \\nsays he was beaten by security guards. Estrada has expressed support \\nfor Anwar, whom he considers a personal friend, and indicated he may \\nnot attend a summit of Asia Pacific Rim nations in Malaysia next month. \\nHe has also said Anwar should be held in house arrest during his upcoming \\ntrial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar has denied \\nthe charges, calling them politically motivated. On Thursday, Estrada \\ntold Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, to tell her father ``not to waver \\nbecause he is fighting for a cause, the cause of the Malaysian people.'' \\nHe said, however, that his support is personal and moral and not meant \\nto interfere in the internal problems of Malaysia. Brillantes said: \\n``The expression of personal opinion is allowed in our culture and \\nit is not surprising for that to happen.'' He also said ``there is \\nno connection'' between Anwar's case and the summit meeting in Malaysia \\nof the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. ``We still consider, \\nas expressed by our president, that APEC is important to us,'' he \\nsaid. He did not say how the Malaysian officials reacted, but he said \\nhe was not reprimanded. Meanwhile, a group Philippine legislators \\nsaid they plan to attend Anwar's trial, which opens Nov. 2. ``We feel \\nthat being observers to his trial will be our silent statement of \\nour democratic aspirations for all Asia,'' the group said in a statement. \\n\\nThe last time the Asia-Pacific region held its annual summit to promote \\nfree trade, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy \\nwouldn't be the next victim of Asia's financial crisis. Canada, the \\nhost country, was criticized by some in Canada for cracking down on \\ndemonstrations against Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler at the \\ntime. And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and booming economy \\nwere the envy of the planet, joined everyone else in urging countries \\nsuch as Thailand and South Korea to bite the bullet and comply with \\nthe tough economic reforms that the International Monetary Fund was \\ndemanding. My, how the challenges have grown, as the 21-nation Asia-Pacific \\nEconomic Cooperation forum prepares for its November summit in Malaysia. \\nJapan _ the world's second largest economy, and Asia's financial anchor \\n_ is suffering through its worst recession since World War II, and \\nthat bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job. Suharto, \\nwho ruled Indonesia for 32 years, was driven out of power by a violent, \\npro-democracy movement, and the world's fourth most populous country \\nis in real trouble financially. Wall Street is now coping with a steep \\ndownturn. And even though Clinton has promised to attend the APEC \\nmeeting, some people wonder how he can do that while facing an impeachment \\ninquiry back home, thanks to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Worse \\nstill, Asia's economic crisis is showing signs of going global, and \\nmore and more economists are criticizing the IMF for the way it is \\nhandling its bailouts. Other well-respected economists are going even \\nfurther, questioning whether a free-market philosophy doesn't leave \\nsome countries too vulnerable to the chaos of major market speculators. \\nIn fact, Malaysia isn't the only country trying self-defense mechanisms \\nsuch as capital controls. Hong Kong recently spent a fortune investing \\nin its stock market to ward off speculators. And Washington is trying \\nto figure out what to do with hedge funds after watching its Federal \\nReserve help bail out a major one that was going under, and seeing \\nthe investments of others send the U.S. dollar into a tailspin against \\nJapan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, \\nwho made one of his typical anti-free-market comments during last \\nyear's summit, probably could have opened this year's with an ``I \\ntold you so.'' But even he is having major domestic problems. Mahathir, \\n72, who is widely credited with creating modern Malaysia during his \\n17 years in power, dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his expected successor, \\nin an apparent dispute over how to battle the country's economic mess. \\nInstead of stepping aside, Anwar launched a reform movement across \\nMalaysia that quickly led to big rallies demanding that Mahathir step \\ndown. The prime minister used riot police to thwart the protests, \\nand jailed Anwar, charging him with corruption and sex crimes, and \\nscheduling his trial for Nov. 2. The trial will be interrupted during \\nthe Nov. 12-18 APEC meetings, but Mahathir's treatment of Anwar and \\nhis reform movement already have been criticized by APEC members such \\nas Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United States. President \\nB.J. Habibie of Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada \\nconsider Anwar a friend, and Estrada won't say whether he plans to \\nattend this year's APEC summit. John S. Wolf, the U.S. ambassador \\nfor APEC, recently acknowledged that it won't be easy for APEC members \\nto meet in Malaysia as the Asian crisis ``ricochets around the world \\nwith no clear sign what will happen next.'' But he also said the leaders \\nof the 21 APEC members should aim for a productive meeting. Wolf said \\nsuch gatherings give members a chance to discuss IMF bailout strategies \\nand the free-market philosophy, to resolve bilateral disputes, and \\nto continue to reduce tariff rates to help struggling countries improve \\ntheir exports. ``This has been a lousy year in general. It has affected \\nall of us. It has set APEC back, and there is no silver bullet to \\nsolve the crisis right away,'' said Wolf. ``But we should welcome \\nthe chance to work together and to develop a sense of what's possible.'' \\nSo far, APEC has been criticized for doing little during the financial \\ncrisis. But next month it hopes to complete a plan that would lift \\ntrade barriers in nine key industries: environmental products and \\nservices, energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, \\nchemical products and telecommunications. Besides the United States, \\nAPEC, which accounts for half of all global trade _ consists of these \\nmembers: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, \\nJapan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, \\nSingapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. During the Malaysia meeting, \\nAPEC also will include three new members: Russia _ one of the latest \\nvictims of the financial crisis _ Vietnam and Peru. \\n\\nAgain bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic \\nplanner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific \\nEconomic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry \\nsaid Friday. Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders \\nsummit on Nov. 17-18 after ``giving much thought'' to an invitation \\nfrom Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said. \\nPresentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation _ with the \\nunderstanding that it will be politely refused _ is an annual formality \\nthat allows Taiwan to maintain a semblance of dignity and the host \\nto avoid controversy with China. Beijing's threat to boycott APEC's \\nannual meeting if Lee attends has forced him to send a stand-in every \\nyear since the inaugural summit in 1993. China claims Taiwan as a \\nbreakaway province and argues that only sovereign nations are allowed \\nto send their heads of state. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, \\nChile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, \\nMexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, \\nTaiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will \\njoin in November. \\n\\nTop finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region \\nadvised Asia's battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms \\nin their effort to restore stability. Among the necessary steps is \\nfor countries to restructure their economies and corporations to make \\nthem less susceptible to abuse by narrow political interests, the \\nofficials suggested. The deputy finance ministers and deputy central \\nbank governors met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila \\nFramework,'' an agreement reached last November that aims to promote \\nregional economic stability. Many of Asia's economies have plunged \\ninto recession since that agreement. Collapsed currencies, weakened \\ndemand and higher unemployment now characterize a region that once \\nboasted some of the world's highest economic growth rates. The worsening \\nfinancial gloom is likely to dominate talks at next week's summit \\nin Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic \\nCooperation forum. The summit is to take place on Nov. 17-18. In a \\njoint statement, the officials cited risks including slower global \\ngrowth, with particular mention of Russia's worsening economy, and \\nthe need to speed up social programs to help the poor in the worst-hit \\ncountries. Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the International \\nMonetary Fund, noted that some countries have already reformed their \\nbanking sectors. But he stressed the need for corporate restructuring \\nas well. ``These are not easy things to do,'' he said. Meanwhile, \\nMalaysia's most prominent dissident predicted that the country's prime \\nminister would declare ``a state of emergency'' after the APEC meeting \\nends in Kuala Lumpur, a report said Sunday. Former Deputy Prime Minister \\nAnwar Ibrahim, now on trial on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct, \\nmade the warning in an interview with Monday's edition of Time magazine. \\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar in September, saying he \\nwas morally unfit to lead, then had him expelled from Malaysia's ruling \\nparty. Anwar denies the allegations and says they were fabricated \\nbecause Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to the prime minister's \\n17-year rule. \\n\\nThe leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement \\nfor ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next \\nmonth in a case that will test the country's legal system. Prime Minister \\nMahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could ``drop dead'' at any \\ntime. But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy's \\njob within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision \\nwas not expected quickly. The party leaders, who have been conducting \\na national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar \\nwas fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High \\nCourt judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence. \\nThe ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital Saturday, \\naimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform has \\nthe most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had \\ngroomed Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fired his protege from \\nhis posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds \\nhe was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy \\nand Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year \\nrule. Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks \\nof nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and \\nMahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows police \\nto hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his family and \\nlawyers. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked \\nby the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent \\nweeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government. Baton-wielding \\nriot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas and water cannons, \\narresting more than 100 people. ``They decided that the government \\nshould be brought down through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama \\nnews agency quoted Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. \\nHe was expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the \\nUMNO meeting. After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised \\nface, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly \\nfrom the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised \\nthe possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia \\nnext month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's \\nvisit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated, \\nthe Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying. \\nClinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the Asia-Pacific \\nEconomic Cooperation forum. Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered \\nhospital checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four \\ncharges of abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation. \\nHis trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings. \\nHe has pleaded innocent to all charges, including another corruption \\ncount and five charges of sodomy. He faces 14 years in prison and \\na fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus whipping, on each \\nsexual charge, if convicted. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the \\nInternal Security Act, which allows jail without trial. Under the \\nsame law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associates \\nand a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12 had been released. \\nThe UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top candidates \\nfor Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, \\nwhich is close to the government, listed the favorites as Foreign \\nMinister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. \\nOther top contenders included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, \\na former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June as \\n``special functions minister'' in charge of economic recovery. Rafidah \\nAziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh \\nHamzah, a former finance minister, were also in the running. \\n\\nThe agenda might be global, but the menu will be Malaysian when world \\nleaders meet next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. \\nPacific Rim leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample \\nlocal dishes at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit. \\nIt's expected to be a hot affair. Spicy delicacies on the menu are \\nsatay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce; ayam percik, \\nchicken curry with chilies; soto ayam, a Malaysian chicken soup, and \\nfried rice ``village-style,'' the Star newspaper reported in Monday \\neditions. Desert will be simple: fresh tropical fruit, said Maleia \\nMarsden, general manager of the Cyberview Lodge, where the leaders \\nwere expected to stay during the summit Nov. 17-18. APEC groups Australia, \\nBrunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, \\nMalaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, \\nSingapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam \\nand Peru will also join APEC this year. \\n\", \"\\nHurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, \\nits devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands \\nand mainland communities. At least 32 people were killed and widespread \\nflooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground. Mitch, \\nonce among the century's most powerful hurricanes, weakened today \\nas it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpours that \\nflooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked up huge waves that pounded \\nseaside communities. The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, \\nit had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 \\nkph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of \\nearly Tuesday. After remaining virtually stationary for more than \\na day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center \\nof the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly \\nto the south but remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force \\nwinds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with \\nrain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that. Caught \\nnear the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 \\nkilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. \\n``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, \\na resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast. \\n``Few houses have remained standing.'' Honduran officials said 14 \\npeople had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had \\ndied elsewhere in the country. More than 72,000 people had been evacuated \\nto shelters. Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the \\nregion by early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to \\njust off the coast and seemed to park there. An American was thrown \\nfrom his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and was presumed \\ndead. Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding. Honduran officials \\nsaid more than 200 towns and villages had been isolated by the storm, \\nleft without power, telephones or clean drinking water. Agriculture \\nMinister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain, citrus and banana \\ncrops had been damaged ``and the economic future of Honduras is uncertain.'' \\nRain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba, \\na coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (128 kilometers) \\nfrom the Bay Islands. About 10,000 residents fled to crowded shelters \\nin schools, churches and firehouses. While supplies of food and gasoline \\nseemed to hold up, drivers worried about the coming days formed long \\nlines to fill their tanks at gas stations and some supermarkets took \\nmeasures to limit panic buying. La Ceiba officials appealed for pure \\nwater for those in shelters and some residents set out plastic buckets \\nto collect rainwater. Only a few hotels and offices with their own \\ngenerators had electricity. Wind-whipped waves almost buried some \\nhouses near the shore. People evacuated low-lying houses by wading \\nthrough chest-deep water with sodden bags of belongings on their heads. \\nIn neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal Belize \\nCity had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest city into \\na ghost town. Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few \\npeople wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company \\nwas broadcasting only The Weather Channel. With the storm seemingly \\nanchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency \\nmeasures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds \\nof people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night. More \\nthan 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas, \\nleaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity. Houston accountant \\nKathy Montgomery said that she and her friend Nina Devries had tried \\nto leave Cancun but found all the flights full. ``It's been horrible,'' \\nsaid Montgomery, as she and her friend drank cocktails at an outdoor \\nrestaurant. ``We couldn't go out on a boat, we couldn't go snorkeling. \\n``Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed,'' she said \\ndejectedly, referring to two restaurants. ``Some vacation.'' The U.S. \\nAgency for International Development sent two helicopters each to \\nBelize and Honduras to help in search, rescue and relief efforts. \\nAt its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in \\nthis century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor \\nDay hurricane of 1935. \\n\\nBetter information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials \\nto lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 \\nto about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help \\nwas growing. President Carlos Flores declared Hurricane Mitch had \\nset back Honduras' development by 50 years. He urged the more than \\n1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery \\neffort. ``The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort \\nand most fervent and constant work of every one of its children,'' \\nhe said. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, Mexican rescue teams began searching \\nfor avalanche victims. Honduran doctors dispensed vaccinations to \\nprevent disease outbreaks in shelters crammed with refugees. As of \\nThursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' \\nearlier estimate of 7,000. The numbers of missing dropped from an \\nestimated 11,000 to 4,621, Government Minister Delmer Urbizo said. \\n``We have more access to places affected by the storm,'' Urbizo explained. \\n``Until now, we have had a short amount of time and few resources \\nto get reliable information.'' In Nicaragua, around 2,000 people were \\nkilled, most of those swept away when a volcano crater lake collapsed \\na week ago. El Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala said 194 of its \\npeople had been killed. Six people died in southern Mexico and seven \\nin Costa Rica. Aid groups and governments have called for other countries \\nto send medicine, water, canned food, roofing materials and equipment \\nto help deliver supplies. In Washington on Thursday, President Bill \\nClinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and \\nservices and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to \\nHonduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The White House also \\nsaid Clinton was dispatching Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al \\nGore, to Central America on a mission to show the U.S. commitment \\nto providing humanitarian relief. Hillary Rodham Clinton also will \\ntravel to the region, visiting Nicaragua and Honduras on Nov. 16. \\nShe later will stop in El Salvador and Guatemala before continuing \\non to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for a visit that had been canceled \\ndue to Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October. Mitch, \\nwhich sat off the Honduran coast for several days last week, destroyed \\nscores of Central American communities before moving northwest. The \\nweakened storm crossed southern Florida on Thursday, damaging mobile \\nhomes and buildings and injuring at least seven people. Countries \\noverwhelmed by the storm's devastation have only just begun to calculate \\nthe damage. Honduran authorities still don't know how many shelters \\nhave been set up across the Central American country. Surveyors have \\nyet to evaluate roughly 10 percent of the most affected areas _ the \\ndepartments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern \\nCholuteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, \\nwhich includes the capital. Numbers still can vary wildly. The estimated \\nnumber of homeless dropped from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday. Mitch \\ndamaged or destroyed at least 90 bridges on major highways, including \\nmost spans on Highway 5, the main north-south route, officials said. \\nUrbizo said Honduran officials hoped the scale of need in next-door \\nNicaragua wouldn't overshadow Honduras' plight. ``Our problem is that \\nall of the country has been affected,'' he said. Thursday's relief \\noperations paled in comparison to the scope of the disaster. A total \\nof 14 helicopter relief missions were delivering aid to stricken towns, \\nsaid Col. Roger Antonio Caceres of the government's Operation Mitch \\nemergency response task force. ``We can manage with the number of \\naircraft we have because there is little to distribute,'' Caceres \\nsaid. More help was on the way. Mexico was sending 700 tons of food, \\n11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and \\n475 soldiers to help in relief operations. The United States committed \\n19 Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters, two C-27 aircraft and one C-130 \\ncargo plane. France said it was sending 250 rescue workers to Central \\nAmerica, along with a ship loaded with construction material and equipment. \\nThe U.N. World Food Program said Thursday it was diverting ships, \\nsome already at sea, to rush their cargoes of donated food to Central \\nAmerica. It also was pulling food from warehouses at its base in Rome, \\nprobably for delivery by emergency relief flights, spokesman Trevor \\nRowe said. ``We're trying to move food as fast as possible to help \\npeople as soon as possible,'' Rowe said. Searches for the missing \\ncontinued, and some decomposed bodies, once found, were being buried \\nin common graves. About 100 victims had been buried around Tegucigalpa, \\nMayor Nahum Valladeres said. In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood \\nof Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers loaded search dogs on \\ntheir backs and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried \\nin a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday. Dozens \\nof homes were swept into the river. ``This is the first place we've \\nbeen'' with the dogs, Honduran army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. \\n``From here we'll continue searching downriver.'' Concerned that crowded \\nshelter conditions could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory \\ninfections and other ailments, the Health Ministry announced an inoculation \\ncampaign, especially for children. Doctors volunteering at a shelter \\nhousing 4,000 people at Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute \\nsaid they'd heard of the campaign but had yet to receive word or medicines \\nfrom the Health Ministry. ``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said \\nDr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter \\nfor diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections. \\n\\nHonduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch \\nroared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and \\nintense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. \\nPresident Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert \\nand the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their \\nhomes on islands near the coast. At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 \\nmiles (152 kilometers) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands. With \\nwinds near 180 mph (289 kph), and even higher gusts, it was a Category \\n5 monster _ the highest, most dangerous rating for a storm. The 350-mile \\n(560-kilometer) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph). \\n``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, \\nan island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast. ``And God \\nhelp us.'' Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters \\nsaid, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five \\ndays. The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could \\nweaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain ``a very dangerous \\nhurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage.'' The entire coast \\nof Honduras was under a hurricane warning and up to 15 inches (38 \\ncentimeters) of rain was forecast in mountain areas. The Honduran \\npresident closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and \\nordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from \\nthe Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's \\ncentral coast. The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung \\nPacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the \\nstorm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone. ``For \\nthat humanitarian work, we would need more than 300 Hercules C-137 \\nplanes,'' he said. ``Honduras doesn't have them.'' A hurricane warning \\nwas also in effect for the Caribbean coast of Guatemala. In Belize, \\na hurricane watch was in place and the government also closed schools \\nand sent workers home early Monday. Panic buying stripped bread from \\nthe shelves of some stores and some gasoline stations ran dry. Coastal \\nBelize City was hit so hard by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country \\nbuilt a new capital inland at Belmopan. Mexico mobilized troops and \\nemergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, \\nwhich was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated \\n600 vacationers from the Island of Youth. Jerry Jarrell, the weather \\ncenter director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike \\nthe Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. \\nIn La Ceiba, on Honduras' northern coast, people stood in long lines \\nat filling stations Monday to buy gasoline under a steady rain. Maria \\nGonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with when her firewood gets \\nwet. Still, she bought only 37 cents worth _ all she could afford. \\n``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said. ``If \\nit gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect \\nof the world has in store for us.'' Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman \\non Utila, had tied up his boats and was taking his family to stay \\nwith a relative on higher ground. National police spokesman Ivan Mejia \\nsaid the Coco, Segovia and Cruta rivers all overflowed their banks \\nMonday along Honduras' eastern coast. ``Frightened people are moving \\ninto the mountains to search for shelter,'' he said. In El Progreso, \\n100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, \\nthe army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana \\nplantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. \\nBefore bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the \\nCayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital, \\nKingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans, \\na British colony of 28,000 people. The strongest hurricane to hit \\nHonduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' \\nCaribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people. \\n\\nAid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, \\nwho are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake \\nof the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. \\nForeign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, \\nbut damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching \\nhundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could \\nbe dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through. In \\nthe Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded, \\nleaving a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres (hectares). In many \\nnearby villages, residents have gone days without potable water or \\nfood. A 7-month-old baby died in the village of Olvido after three \\ndays without food. Residents feared more children would die. ``The \\nworst thing, the saddest thing, are the children. The children are \\nsuffering, even dying,'' said the Rev. Cecilio Escobar Gallindo, the \\nparish priest. A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally \\nquiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering \\naid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina. Former U.S. \\nPresident Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intended to visit Nicaragua \\non Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center \\nin Atlanta announced. ``We hope this visit will help call attention \\nto the suffering and humanitarian need this disaster has created,'' \\nCarter said in a statement. U.S. President Bill Clinton requested \\na ``global relief effort'' to help Central America and boosted U.S. \\nemergency aid to dlrs 70 million. Clinton is dispatching a delegation \\nnext week led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver \\nsome of the supplies destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador \\nand Guatemala. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and \\nHonduras to a trip she plans to the region beginning Nov. 16. Taiwan \\nsaid today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, \\nNicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four countries are among \\na dwindling number of nations that recognize Taiwan, which China claims \\nis a breakaway province. Two British ships that were in the area on \\nan exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, \\nthe Defense Ministry said Friday. ``It's a coincidence that the ships \\nare there but they've got men and equipment that can be put to work \\nin an organized way,'' said International Development Secretary Clare \\nShort. Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctors \\nas long as the communist nation flies them in on its own helicopters \\nand with their own supplies. Nicaraguan leaders previously had refused \\nCuba's offer of medical help, saying it did not have the means to \\ntransport or support the doctors. Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, \\nwho maintained close relations with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 \\nrule, had criticized the refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration. \\n\\nAt least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane \\nMitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National \\nEmergency Commission said Saturday. Mitch _ once, 2nd graf pvs \\n\\nIn Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National \\nEmergency Commission said Saturday. El Salvador _ where 140 people \\ndied in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as \\ndid Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes. \\nMexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday. In the Caribbean, \\nthe U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with \\n31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday. By late \\nSunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to \\nnear 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical \\ndepression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast \\nnear the Guatemalan border. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) \\nand was dissipating but threatened to strengthen again if it moved \\nback out to sea. \\n\\nNicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between \\n1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) \\narea below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. \\nThat is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, \\nBolanos said. \\n\\nBRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 \\nmillion European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands \\nof victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central \\nAmerica. EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used \\nto provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and \\nblankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential \\nrains and mudslides. The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El \\nSalvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's \\ndeadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement. Officials \\nin Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have \\ndied in the region. The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, \\nwhere an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent \\nof the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's \\nstorm. El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174 dead, \\n96 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own regional affiliate in \\nSan Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone. Guatemala reported \\n100 storm-related deaths. The latest EU aid follows an initial 400,000 \\necu (dlrs 480,000). the EU approved for the region on Friday. The \\nfull 6.8 million ecu (dlrs 8.18 million) will be channeled through \\nhumanitarian groups working in the region. \\n\\nHurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean \\non Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping \\ntrees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at \\nleast 32 people. Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over \\nthe Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area. It also was \\nonly 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched \\noutward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles \\n(280 kms). That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane \\nconditions for more than a day. ``The hurricane has destroyed almost \\neverything,'' said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which \\nwas within miles (kms) of the eye of the hurricane. ``Few houses have \\nremained standing.'' At its, 4th graf pvs \\n\\nPope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American \\ncountries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the \\nthousands who are suffering. Speaking during his general audience, \\nthe pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of \\ngood will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction \\nand death.'' Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout \\nCentral America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies \\nhave been overwhelmed. Among those attending the audience were six \\nRussian cosmonauts taking a special course in Italy. As a gift, they \\ngave John Paul a spacesuit. \\n\", \"\\nBRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday expressed its \\n``deep concern'' over reports of physical abuse of Malaysia's former \\ndeputy-prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who was arrested last month. \\n``The EU urges the Malaysian authorities to ensure that similar incidents \\nwill not occur again in the future and that Anwar Ibrahim be assured \\ncorrect treatment while in custody,'' a statement by the 15 EU countries \\nsaid. The EU ``hopes that appropriate action will be taken against \\nany individuals, including officials, found responsible for such mistreatment,'' \\nthe statement added. On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir \\nMohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office. Mahathir \\nand Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir \\nfeared him as an alternative leader. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign \\nagainst the prime minister before being detained as a national security \\nrisk and charged with illegal homosexual acts and corruption in connection \\nwith those allegations. Earlier this week, Anwar appeared in court \\nwith a black eye and bruises on his neck and arms. He told the magistrate's \\ncourts he was beaten by police on Sept. 20, the night of his arrest. \\nFaced with mounting public criticism, Mahathir called Thursday for \\na probe by the attorney general of the alleged mistreatment of Anwar. \\nThe EU statement welcomed the opening of this investigation. It also \\nwelcomed the release of seven youth leaders, including Ahmad Zahid \\nHamidi, the head of the youth wing of the ruling United Malays National \\nOrganization and a former ally of Anwar, who were arrested last week \\nin connection with demonstrations in favor of the ousted deputy-premier. \\n``The EU expresses hope that the other political demonstrators still \\ndetained under the Internal Security Act will also be released soon,'' \\nthe statement said. The former deputy-premier, who was also finance \\nminister, pleaded innocent this week to charges of sodomy and corruption. \\nA number of Anwar's associates are still detained. \\n\\nThe arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim \\nwon't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's \\ntrade minister said Thursday. Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir \\nMohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then \\nbegan speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. ``Frankly \\nspeaking there is no reason to say that just because one man was arrested \\nfor something ... that it should bring any unrest,'' trade minister \\nRafidah Aziz said. ``Leaders come and go. ... They even get sacked \\nin all countries of the world. They even die,'' she told a news conference \\nin Manila, where she attended a meeting of Association of Southeast \\nAsian Nations economic ministers. Rafidah said there have only been \\na few demonstrations in Malaysia over Anwar's arrest, all of them \\n``orchestrated.'' In recent visits to Chicago, New York, Houston and \\nBoston, she said potential investors asked her about Anwar's arrest \\nbut were still interested in investing in Malaysia. Anwar said police \\nbeat him in custody. In recent appearances in court, where he is facing \\ncharges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts, he was seen with \\na black eye and a neck brace. At least two ASEAN leaders, Philippine \\nPresident Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, have \\nspoken out against Anwar's treatment. The Philippine leader said he \\nwas considering skipping a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia \\nin November to protest the arrest of Anwar, whom he described as a \\npersonal friend. He later said he would attend the summit and had \\nonly made the earlier remarks out of sympathy toward Anwar. The Philippines, \\nMalaysia and Indonesia are founding member countries of ASEAN, which \\nalso includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. \\n\\nBruises on the face of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed on \\nnewspaper front pages for two days and downloaded from the Internet, \\nare blemishing the image of Malaysian police. After first suggesting \\nthat the former deputy prime minister had beaten himself on the face, \\nneck and arms during 10 days in police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir \\nMohamad called for an investigation of the wounds Anwar displayed \\nin court Tuesday and Wednesday. ``We can't accept this and we will \\nundertake full investigations,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying in \\nThursday's New Straits Times. ``The police cannot harm their detainees \\nin the course of their interrogation.'' Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. \\n2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying \\nhe was morally unfit for office. The two had differed over economic \\npolicy as the country veered into recession and Anwar has said the \\n72-year-old Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader. Local newspapers \\nthat are normally pro-Mahathir have splashed close-up photos of Anwar's \\nbadly bruised face for two days. People are peering at the pictures, \\ndownloading copies from the Internet, discussing whether Mahathir, \\nwho also oversees the police as home affairs minister, knew what was \\nhappening to the man he had once groomed as his successor. It was \\nnot the first time that a Malaysian has said he was tortured or mistreated \\nin police custody. But there has been no one as high-profile as Anwar. \\n``What I experienced was chicken feed compared to Anwar,'' Syed Husin \\nAli, head of the opposition Malaysian People's Party, said Thursday. \\nIn a book about his six-month detention under the same law that kept \\nAnwar away from family and lawyers for 10 days, Syed described being \\nhit and deprived of sleep. ``At least I didn't have bruises on my \\nface, although I was slapped and hit on the stomach,'' Syed told The \\nAssociated Press. Anwar's bruises raise ``alarming questions about \\nthe state of governance in the country,'' said Lim Kit Siang, leader \\nof the opposition Democratic Action Party. If Mahathir did not know \\nof the alleged beatings, it suggests the police acted on their own. \\nAt a series of rallies before his arrest, Anwar led throngs in chanting \\nfor Mahathir's resignation and a more open, less corrupt government. \\nHis arrest Sept. 20 was followed by street protests and hundreds of \\nadditional arrests. Before his arrest, Anwar designated his wife, \\nAzizah Ismail, as the leader of his new ``reform'' movement. But police \\nhave banned her from speaking publicly. On Thursday she was summoned \\nfor the third time to police headquarters for questioning about an \\ninterview with regional television network CNBC Asia. She had expressed \\nfears that her husband would be injected with the HIV virus to prove \\nallegations of homosexuality, and police are investigating possible \\ncharges of sedition against her. She called the repeated interviews \\n``pressure and harassment.'' Three Malaysian police officers traveled \\nto Singapore Thursday to ask CNBC news anchors how they had arranged \\nto get the Sept. 21 interview with Azizah and one with Anwar on Sept. \\n3. CNBC refused to answer questions about its news gathering, said \\nvice president of news programming Chris Blackman. Anwar, who pleaded \\ninnocent this week to five charges of sodomy and five of corruption, \\ntold the court that police beat him the night he was arrested, ``until \\nblood seeped down my nose,'' leaving him half-conscious. His allegations, \\naccompanied by pictorial evidence, brought prompt expressions of disapproval, \\nfrom the U.S. State Department, the Australian government, Amnesty \\nInternational, and the finance ministers of other countries who used \\nto meet with Anwar at international conferences. On Thursday, the \\nIndonesian government, where security forces have been accused for \\nyears of mistreating prisoners, said it regretted the reports about \\nAnwar's injuries and that the allegations have placed in doubt a visit \\nto Malaysia by President B.J. Habibie. \\n\\nAmong Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was notable \\nas a man with a bold vision: a physical and social transformation \\nthat would push this nation into the forefront of world affairs. It \\nalmost came true. In 17 years as prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who \\nis a medical doctor, fostered an economic liberalization that led \\nto some of the world's fastest rates of growth. He drove Malaysians \\nto be more productive, to embrace high technology and to begin major \\ninvestments around the world. He created a national affirmative-action \\nprogram that allowed the country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians \\nto share in improved living standards and a new sense of Malaysian \\nidentity and pride. This year was to have been Mahathir's year of \\ntriumph, perhaps paving the way for his retirement, with the inauguration \\nof huge public works projects and impressive gatherings of foreign \\nleaders and sportsmen. But today, in a dizzying turnaround, Malaysia \\nis on Asia's critical list, its economy teetering on the edge of disaster \\nand its stability shaken by what seems to have been an entirely avoidable \\npolitical cat fight. Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his \\ndeputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him of corruption \\nand illegal sex acts. The move set off street demonstrations and aroused \\ninternational condemnation, particularly from Anwar's many friends \\nin foreign governments. One of the region's most stable and prosperous \\nnations is suddenly in an uproar. It appears that as in Indonesia, \\nThailand, Japan and South Korea, the pressures of economic collapse \\nhave spawned a political crisis. In all those nations, the result \\nwas a change in leadership. The question now is: Is Mahathir next? \\nThe answer is far from clear. Unlike in Indonesia, there has been \\nlittle evidence of a simmering discontent in Malaysia. The ouster \\nof former President Suharto in Indonesia had been predicted by many \\npeople. Almost no one seems to have foreseen the eruption here. Malaysia \\nis not familiar with political demonstrations. Unlike Indonesians, \\nMalaysians rarely riot. Many people here were puzzled and disturbed \\nwhen they encountered water cannon and the riot police on the streets \\nin recent weeks. ``What we're seeing is unprecedented,'' said Ambassador \\nJohn Malott of the United States. ``This has never happened in Malaysia, \\nand nobody knows where it's going to go. You can write a lot of scenarios \\nbut we are in totally uncharted waters.'' Mahathir, the confident \\nnation-builder, seems to be flailing as he watches his legacy crumble. \\nAn economy that had been growing at more than 8 percent a year for \\nthe last decade is now headed for a contraction of perhaps 6 percent. \\nAngry and frustrated, he closed Malaysia off from international financial \\nmarkets one month ago, turning his back on the foreign investors whom \\nhe once embraced and who had fueled the country's rapid growth. The \\nmove had the intended effect of bringing home the Malaysian currency, \\ninsulating it from the speculators Mahathir blames for the crisis, \\nand giving an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained economy. It \\nis a move that seems in tune with a recent round of questioning of \\nthe economic orthodoxy of the International Monetary Fund. But few \\nforeign economists expect it to work for long. ``Mahathir is attacking \\nthe fundamental beliefs of the free market, of capitalism, of Wall \\nStreet,'' a foreign diplomat said. ``We are either watching economic \\ntheory being rewritten or reconfirmed _ and I don't think it's being \\nrewritten.'' The day after making his economic gamble, Mahathir set \\noff the most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismissing Anwar, \\nthe man he had been grooming to be his successor. Two weeks later, \\nAnwar was arrested at his home and held incommunicado for 10 days, \\nduring which he says he was beaten by his jailers. Last week he was \\ncharged with 10 counts of corruption and sexual misconduct that could \\nresult in a prison term of up to 34 years. The harshness of those \\nmoves unleashed a surge of largely unsuspected discontent that mobilized \\nAnwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals \\nand politically assertive Muslims. For the first time in decades, \\nMalaysians by the thousands demonstrated in the streets and in mosques \\nand were met with tear gas and water cannon. Many people were beaten \\nand hundreds were detained, although most were later released. With \\nthe emergence of this still-tentative opposition movement, the fear \\nexpressed by one Western diplomat is of a ``downward spiral'' in which \\n``suppression breeds more discontent breeds more suppression breeds \\nmore discontent.'' People here whisper that Mahathir's days may now \\nbe numbered. But few venture a guess at what the number might be. \\nGiven his control of the levers of power and the lack of focus or \\nleadership in the opposition, Mahathir could ride out the storm as \\nAnwar's trial proceeds. But he has struck a harsh blow to the morale \\nof his own nation, to the sense of confidence he had worked so hard \\nto build under the slogan ``Malaysia Can!'' In this generally decorous \\nnation, the depth of anger expressed by two men who once called each \\nother father and son is disturbing to hear. Anwar, says the prime \\nminister, is ``despicable'' and ``a sodomist.'' Mahathir, says his \\nformer deputy, is ``senile'' and ``insane.'' Malaysians, who have \\nstolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian rule with a mixture of \\ngratitude and emerging pride, seem stunned. \\n\\nDeprived of a voice in state-controlled newspapers and television, \\nsupporters of Malaysia's jailed opposition leader have turned to the \\nInternet to air their views. Although the government said police would \\n``check every bit of information and leaflet'' posted on the Internet, \\nMalaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledged Friday the medium is \\n``impossible to control.'' Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual \\nmisconduct and corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar \\nIbrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia. In the realm of cyberspace, \\nthough, he's top dog. Within hours of Anwar's recent speech accusing \\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of cruelty and insanity, dozens of \\nboot-legged recordings had been posted onto new websites hatched by \\nsupporters. Among the hottest images now making the Internet rounds \\nare several news-photo versions of Anwar's badly bruised eye, which \\nhe claims was inflicted by police during his first night of detention. \\nMost pro-Anwar sites also contain his speeches, private letters to \\nMahathir, clippings of foreign news reports and prose scorching the \\n72-year old prime minister. Most of the Internet content about Anwar \\nis false or unverifiable, but the medium is tough to rein in, said \\nAzzman Shariffadeen, head of Mimos, the company that set up Malaysia's \\nInternet infrastructure. ``No website has been blocked or censored \\nby the government,'' he said. Shortly after Anwar's arrest, one of \\nthe former leader's aides bragged that they had set up dozens of sites \\noffshore, beyond the reach of the Malaysian government. Malaysian \\njournalist M.G.G. Pillai, who runs a popular website on local politics, \\nisn't surprised by the aggressive march toward cyberspace. ``When \\nyou're in the opposition and you have no access to resources and media, \\nthen you end up making use of what's available to air your grouses,'' \\nhe said, noting that membership on his site has soared by 40 percent \\nsince Anwar's ouster. The cyber explosion is a boon to most middle-class \\nMalaysians, who are leery of local media. ``I've finally given up \\nreading local newspapers. They're so skewed,'' said Michael Chan, \\na lawyer who upgraded his computer with a high-speed modem the day \\nafter Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20. Chan uses the modem to download \\npictures of balaclava-clad police in bulletproof jackets busting down \\nAnwar's front door before bundling him off to jail. Occasionally, \\nhe receives e-mail calling for organized rallies at the National Mosque \\nand nearby Independence Square, where hundreds of protesters have \\nbeen arrested by police. The advertised demonstrations don't always \\nmaterialize. Other e-mails call for ``silent protests.'' Malaysians \\nare being urged on the Internet now to switch off all lights for 10 \\nminutes on Oct. 6 to declare their ``state of sorrow, sadness and \\ndarkness'' over national injustice. \\n\\nIndonesian President B.J. Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific \\nleaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of \\nMalaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported \\nSunday. Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia \\nfor an annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph \\nEstrada said he was considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic \\nCooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. ``I'm very concerned \\nover how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been treated,'' Habibie was quoted \\nas saying by the English-language newspaper The Nation. ``I'm concerned \\nbecause people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed \\na lot for the benefit of his country.'' Anwar is a charismatic politician \\nwho was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving \\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he was suddenly fired by Mahathir \\non Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then began \\nspeaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. Anwar has \\nbeen accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia \\nlaw, but the charges are generally seen as a pretext for his political \\npersecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised \\nand he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international \\nattention to his case. ``Because of human rights involved _ and I \\nthink it is universal _ people should be given the chance to defend \\nthemselves,'' Habibie was quoted as saying in the interview conducted \\nSaturday. ``People should not be tortured.'' Habibie said Anwar's \\ndismissal should not have been based ``on things which had not been \\nproven.'' On attending the APEC meeting, he said, ``It's difficult \\nfor me.'' But he said he would consult parliament, adding, ``I'm not \\ncoming personally but as the president of 211 million people of Indonesia.'' \\nLike Estrada, Habibie served as his country's vice president when \\nAnwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts on the international \\naffairs circuit. \\n\\nA key witness in the government's sexual misconduct case against Malaysia's \\nformer deputy prime minister remains determined to appeal his conviction, \\nhis attorney said Monday. Munawar Ahmad Aness, a friend and speech \\nwriter of Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, \\nallegedly confessing to having sex with the political dissident. Anwar \\nhas said the guilty plea was coerced. Aness, a Pakistani with permanent \\nresidence in the United States, was sentenced to six months in jail. \\nIn a move that could deal a major setback to the case against Anwar, \\nAness then filed a letter of appeal through his lawyers. Another letter \\nthen appeared, saying Aness would not go through with the appeal. \\nHis lawyers say the second letter was a fraud. ``His instructions \\nare he wants us to proceed with the appeal. There is no change,'' \\nsaid Balwant Singh, one of two lawyers defending Aness, after a meeting \\nwith Aness. One of the major charges against Anwar hinges on Aness' \\nconfession. Singh spoke to reporters after attending court proceedings \\nMonday where Anwar's trial was fixed for Nov. 2 on corruption charges. \\nHe said he went to a hospital to meet Aness when the court broke for \\nlunch. Aness was jailed on Sept. 15 but moved soon after to a hospital \\nwhere he has been under treatment for heart problems. ``He has given \\nus the written retainer. He signed a notice of appeal. We have instructions \\nto proceed and we are proceeding,'' said Singh, adding he filed the \\nletter of appeal in court Sept. 29. Between the visits with his client, \\nhowever, Aness signed another letter saying he would not proceed with \\nthe appeal, Singh said. That led to confusion whether Aness really \\nwanted an appeal. ``Somebody approached him and asked him to sign \\na typewritten letter,'' said Singh. ``He was asked to sign it and \\nhe did.'' \\n\\nThe leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement \\nfor ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next \\nmonth in a case that will test the country's legal system. Prime Minister \\nMahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could ``drop dead'' at any \\ntime. But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy's \\njob within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision \\nwas not expected quickly. The party leaders, who have been conducting \\na national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar \\nwas fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High \\nCourt judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence. \\nThe ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital Saturday, \\naimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform has \\nthe most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had \\ngroomed Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fired his protege from \\nhis posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds \\nhe was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy \\nand Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year \\nrule. Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks \\nof nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and \\nMahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows police \\nto hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his family and \\nlawyers. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked \\nby the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent \\nweeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government. Baton-wielding \\nriot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas and water cannons, \\narresting more than 100 people. ``They decided that the government \\nshould be brought down through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama \\nnews agency quoted Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. \\nHe was expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the \\nUMNO meeting. After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised \\nface, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly \\nfrom the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised \\nthe possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia \\nnext month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's \\nvisit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated, \\nthe Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying. \\nClinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the Asia-Pacific \\nEconomic Cooperation forum. Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered \\nhospital checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four \\ncharges of abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation. \\nHis trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings. \\nHe has pleaded innocent to all charges, including another corruption \\ncount and five charges of sodomy. He faces 14 years in prison and \\na fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus whipping, on each \\nsexual charge, if convicted. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the \\nInternal Security Act, which allows jail without trial. Under the \\nsame law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associates \\nand a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12 had been released. \\nThe UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top candidates \\nfor Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, \\nwhich is close to the government, listed the favorites as Foreign \\nMinister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. \\nOther top contenders included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, \\na former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June as \\n``special functions minister'' in charge of economic recovery. Rafidah \\nAziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh \\nHamzah, a former finance minister, were also in the running. \\n\\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about \\nwho will be his successor. The man need not necessarily be very religious \\nand only preoccupied with doing virtuous deeds at all times, the national \\nnews agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir as saying after Friday prayers \\nat the Al-Falah Mosque in the northern town of Jitra in Kedah state. \\n``It is sufficient that the person does things acceptable by the people,'' \\nMahathir said. So far Mahathir, 72, has designated three heirs-apparent \\nduring his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenged Mahathir \\nfor leadership of the ruling party, and lost. On Sept. 2, he fired \\nthe last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him morally unfit for office. \\nAnwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before \\nbeing detained as a national security risk and charged with illegal \\nhomosexual acts and corruption in connection with those allegations. \\nMahathir told reporters later that Anwar had been working toward toppling \\nhim as prime minister and president of the governing coalition's dominant \\nparty, the United Malays National Organization. ``He appeared very \\ngood to me but he was actually planning ways of bringing me down. \\nAt first, I did not believe when people told me about this, but I \\nnow know this to be true,'' said Mahathir. Mahathir said Anwar had \\narranged for his supporters to contest for and gain control of the \\nUMNO divisions so that he could win the party's top post in next year's \\nparty elections. \\n\\nLawyers for the prime minister's former deputy, now his most prominent \\nopponent, went to court Thursday to demand their client's release \\nfrom indefinite detention. Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed politician \\nAnwar Ibrahim, told reporters that the lawyers had filed a habeas \\ncorpus appeal that says the dissident politician is being unjustly \\nheld. She said authorities have denied lawyers access to her husband, \\nand asked: ``How are they going to prepare for his defense?'' Anwar, \\n51, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows \\nindefinite detention without trial, after two weeks of rallies around \\nMalaysia at which he called for government reform and Prime Minister \\nMahathir Mohamad's resignation. Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2 from his \\nposts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, after he had \\ndiffered with Mahathir on policy for escaping economic recession. \\nBut the prime minister said the deputy was fired because he was morally \\nunfit. Anwar said Mahathir viewed him as a threat. Anwar since has \\nbeen charged with corruption and illegal homosexual acts, and is to \\ngo on trial Nov. 2. He has pleaded innocent to all the charges, which \\nhe says were trumped up by his political enemies. ``We claim that \\nhis detention is illegal and we'll prove that in court,'' said one \\nof Anwar's lawyers, Pawancheek Marican. He said the lawyers had asked \\nthe High Court for an early hearing on the request for Anwar's release. \\nWhen Anwar appeared in court Monday, the judge had assured defense \\nattorneys that they would have access to their client so that they \\ncould prepare their arguments for the trial. Azizah said authorities \\nhave spurned all her requests for family members to visit her husband \\non grounds that Anwar's case was still under police investigation. \\n``I pleaded with the police to allow the children to see their father,'' \\nshe told reporters at the courthouse. ``I told them that I don't have \\nto see my husband. But please let my son go and see him. But the police \\nsaid no.'' Although Anwar remains in custody at the Bukit Aman federal \\npolice headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, all but five of those arrested \\nunder the ISA for participating in activities and rallies organized \\nby Anwar have been released. Sidek Baba, deputy rector of the International \\nIslamic University, was released Wednesday after 16 days in jail. \\n``I may have been detained because I knew Anwar during my involvement \\nwith the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement,'' Sidek was quoted as saying \\nby The Star daily. Despite the recent protests against him, Prime \\nMinister Mahathir said Wednesday that support for his ruling party \\nremains strong and there have been no defections from the party, which \\nclaims a membership of 2.4 million in a nation of 22 million. He ruled \\nout an early election to prove his popularity. A general election \\nis not scheduled until 2000. Support ``is solid,'' said Mahathir. \\n``There is no exodus from the party.'' This week, Mahathir declined \\nto name a replacement for Anwar, who had been Malaysia's deputy prime \\nminister since 1993. The absence of a successor could lead to a power \\nstruggle in the event Mahathir is forced to resign or dies, because \\nthere is no clear line of succession.
