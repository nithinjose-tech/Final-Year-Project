Chile's ambassador delivered formal protest Foreign Office Monday, saying Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic immunity. He arrived last month diplomatic passport and is also senator-for-life Chile, which protects him prosecution there. Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked torture and other human rights abuses political opponents which, Chilean government has said, 4,299 people were killed or vanished. He remained Chilean army commander-in-chief March. The magistrate broadened his charges Monday include killings Chileans well Spaniards, and genocide  which there is no diplomatic immunity. Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself exile Pinochet's rule, said Chile had duty protect citizen diplomatic immunity and senator status. We are not protecting dictator '70s, Artaza said British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday. What we are fighting and discussing (British) government is special situation senator our transition who many people do not understand and many people don't like. We're not discussing his record his period dictatorship, that present government does not support all, added ambassador. A Chilean specialist international law was traveling London further meetings British officials, Artaza said. Pinochet, expected be hospitalized perhaps two more weeks faces long battle British courts avoid extradition, questioning two Spanish judges who instigated proceedings, and appearance London's Bow Street magistrate's court. British Conservative Party lawmakers accuse Labor government gesture politics and pandering party's left-wing. The wife former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed his release, saying he is too sick be extradited Spain face charges genocide. This is very painful our family, tearful Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday private London Clinic, where her husband is arrest he recuperates back surgery. 'I would ask compassion person who is very, very, very, ill. Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 herniated disc, painful spinal disorder which had hindered his movement.

Unconfirmed media reports Chile this week indicated that Pinochet, who has worn pacemaker years and is diabetic, also has urinary tract infection. There have also been reports that he is suffering depression. In separate attempt block his extradition, lawyers former strongman went court Friday argue that British police acted illegally accepting Spanish warrant. The case resumes Monday.

This is two legal systems united extradition treaty nobody seems understand this, he said. Blair added that should Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and act if he were judge, should he be required make decision extradition request Spain. The tone British Prime Minister's first public comment issue contrasted sharply Sunday's emotional statement influential Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity Pinochet gut-wrenching. The European extradition convention gives Garzon 40 days present formal extradition request British authorities Spanish government. But while Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has promised his government would rubber stamp process if it reaches his desk, he appears be hoping he will never have do so.

His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if bid extradite general succeeded, same token Queen Elizabeth II could be extradited Argentina face trial death Argentine soldiers Falklands war 1982. On opposing side, Alun Jones, British government lawyer acting prosecutor case, defended Spanish warrant, which led general's detention London. The prosecutor argued that the right-wing general was responsible killing least 4,000 people and had set out destroy national group  Chilean nationals who not share his ideological values. After hearing arguments court crowded Chilean exiles public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's senior judge, said court was expected decide matter Tuesday.

A Sudanese expatriate who now lives Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was previously senior manager National Commercial Bank Saudi Arabia. He bought Shifa plant March. Officials say U.S. intelligence has received reports that Idris launders money international Islamic groups, and that he also has stake company Sudan that is 40 percent owned Military Industrial Corporation, government entity that United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons development. Bin Laden has helped finance Military Industrial Corp. his effort use Sudan base chemical weapons production, and talked Sudanese leaders testing poisonous gases U.S. troops Saudi Arabia, according U.S. intelligence. But Pendry denied that Idris owned any businesses Military Industrial Corp. U.S. intelligence officials declined provide details reports Idris' financial dealings members Islamic Jihad. But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated bin Laden's terrorist campaign.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't recognized Taliban government Afghanistan. Albania says it has uncovered terrorist network operated Osama Bin Laden, Islamic fundamentalist accused masterminding August embassy bombings Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated other parts Europe, The Sunday Times reported. The newspaper quoted Fatos Klosi, head Shik, Albanian intelligence service, saying that Bin Laden's network had sent units fight Kosovo, neighboring Serbian province.

Kader claimed trial that he had visited Albania recruit and arm fighters Kosovo, and that four his associates were still large.

MUNICH, Germany (AP)  U.S. prosecutors have asked 20-day extension provide Germany paperwork necessary extradite top lieutenant Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, Sudan, has been jailed his arrest Munich Sept. 16 Bavarian authorities acting U.S. warrant. Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days arrest turn supporting evidence so German court can rule their extradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, said U.S. authorities few days ago asked court hearing case extra 20 days provide necessary material. Quoting unidentified Bavarian law enforcement sources, Focus newsmagazine reported Saturday that evidence turned so far was not very strong. The magazine said much it was based testimony FBI informant, former bin Laden associate, who made only vague connections Salim and terrorist activities. Zierl declined comment report, said U.S. authorities probably asked more time just precautionary measure. U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm members terrorist organization, including alleged bombers U.S. embassies Kenya and Tanzania. A criminal complaint unsealed Sept. 25 U.S. District Court New York charges him murder conspiracy and use weapons mass destruction. Sometime summer 1997, operative Osama bin Laden sat his personal computer hideaway Kenya. He was worried, he wrote angry dispatch, security East Africa network bin Laden, Saudi exile accused masterminding worldwide terrorist conspiracy Americans. The organization, author complained, had declared war United States, he had learned that only news media. The writer, who federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was become one central suspects bombing U.S. Embassy Nairobi year later, noted alarm British press reports arrest aide bin Laden. Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said he was worried that important man close links bin Laden, seemed have fallen enemy's hands. He said Americans were breathing necks his associates Nairobi and that he had take precautions. The cell is 100 percent danger, operative warned. The letter, extraordinary bit digital evidence cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved computer house where Fazil had been staying, according papers filed U.S. District Court New York City. The papers said computer was seized August 1997 raid Kenyan authorities that was attended FBI agent. The documents not make clear whether FBI had translated and read document or bombings U.S. Embassies Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Aug. 7 this year. The timing is potentially important because there have been mounting questions bombings whether United States adequately followed warnings possible terrorist attack American targets Kenya. Officials FBI and U.S. attorney's office New York City refused say Tuesday night what point FBI agents learned computer file, nor would they make any other comment. Fazil eluded American investigators bombing he traveled Kenya his home Comoros Islands and then Middle East. He remains fugitive. The dispatch provides remarkable insight workings terrorist network twilight 20th century. The author talks how he and his fellow operatives follow events CNN and use Internet communicate. He refers himself media information officer East Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept loop big decisions. Along way, almost casual fashion, document seems confirm two central charges federal case bin Laden: That he had planted terrorist cell Nairobi and that his operatives carried out another crimes laid bin Laden's door federal authorities  attacks American soldiers Somalia 1993 and 1994. The writer document warned that followers bin Laden, whom he referred sheik, had become America's primary target. He said his comrades East Africa should know that there is American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence activity Nairobi aiming identify names and residences members who are associated sheik America knows well that youth who lived Somalia and were members sheik's cell are ones who killed Americans Somalia. They know that Kenya was main gateway those members, there must be center Kenya, he wrote, concluding: We are really danger. The government has asserted that one Fazil's duties was prepare and transmit reports bin Laden and his top lieutenants. Federal authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, London-based associate bin Laden, directed Fazil report periodically bin Laden security situation cell. Fawwaz, who served informal press spokesman bin Laden London, was arrested British authorities September embassy bombings. He has denied any connection terrorist activities. A translation report was part package documents American prosecutors have sent Britain support extradition Fawwaz trial New York. It is not clear materials whether report computer was forwarded bin Laden. The documents, which were initially filed secret, include federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz conspiring bin Laden kill Americans overseas. A second count charges him soliciting do so. The report made clear that organization was being run shoestring. Its author wrote that his mother has fallen ill, and that he would return his homeland visit. What do you think? Keep mind we only have $500. He repeatedly expressed his fears American intelligence, which he believed was midst worldwide search bin Laden and his associates. There is war and situation is dangerous, he said. He wrote that American forces kidnapped anyone who threatened national security or American citizens. The author noted alarm recent CIA operation which man accused shooting agency employees had been lured border Pakistan and returned United States trial. According federal authorities, Fazil went play pivotal role bombing Nairobi embassy. Prosecutors assert that he rented villa where bomb was assembled and surveyed embassy's security precautions. On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil drove pickup truck embassy, leading way vehicle carrying bomb that killed more 200 people, including 12 Americans. The author report said that he stood ready fight forces atheism and dictators who wreaked havoc earth. He said that group not have inform its Nairobi-based operatives all its global plans, they needed enough warning go underground while if authorities intensified pressure Nairobi. We, East Africa cell members, do not want know operations plans, he wrote,  we are just implementers. If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial New York bombings U.S. embassies Africa and other acts terror, it is already clear who prosecutors will call chief witness: One his senior aides who has been talking U.S. investigators two years. The government has identified aide court papers pseudonym CS-1, saying person pleaded guilty terrorism charges secret proceeding U.S. district court Manhattan. According government, informant worked closely bin Laden 1989 1996, period when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks U.S. soldiers Somalia and elsewhere. From court papers filed investigation embassy bombings East Africa August, it is clear that informant has provided crucial information federal investigators. They have cited source papers filed support extradition two associates bin Laden who are arrest Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, Saudi exile, is thought be living Afghanistan. The source is also basis many significant charges indictment bin Laden himself, including assertion that he directed attacks U.S. soldiers Somalia and that he attempted obtain nuclear weapons. It is not known whether source is custody somewhere, or hiding government protection. As recently 11 days ago, records show, source swore 5-page affidavit New York notary summarizing his allegations bin Laden. Government officials adamantly declined say anything identity CS-1, which stands confidential source. But least one operative bin Laden's group East Africa concluded more year ago that he knew identity crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, businessman who was married one bin Laden's relatives. The operative's concerns were inflamed report British newspaper that Tayyib was cooperating Saudi and U.S. authorities. In August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph said Tayyib had been custody Saudi Arabia May and had given intelligence officials details bin Laden's bank accounts and businesses. The news Tayyib's possible defection, East African operative wrote report apparently intended group's commanders, almost made me explode. An important man close links bin Laden seems have fallen enemy's hands, and we have take all appropriate security precautions that, operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote his summary security concerns. Fazil has been charged embassy attacks and remains large. The report was typed computer seized last year Kenyan authorities, according government filing last week U.S. district court Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have charged least six members bin Laden's organization terrorist activities or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they said their case will part be based testimony confidential source, suggesting that informant has agreed testify any trial bin Laden or his associates. The arrangement appears have resulted plea bargain which source is cooperating hopes receiving lesser sentence. There is no indication that source has been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take place investigation and ensuing trials are complete. In affidavit prepared last week, source acknowledged pleading guilty terrorism charges United States and said they stemmed attacks U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. The source described taking oath allegiance follow bin Laden's orders, and gave detailed account bin Laden's group, including its history and inner workings. The source told private statements bin Laden other al Qaeda members, encouraging them attack U.S. troops and other citizens stationed Middle East and Africa. I either heard these statements myself, source said, or I read them or learned them other al Qaeda members. The government has also said other court papers that source helped identify bin Laden's signature 1996 document urging Muslims kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not be reached comment. The Taliban's chief justice accused United States Wednesday looking excuse launch another missile attack his war-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, man Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames Aug. 7 bombings U.S. embassies East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said interview The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 United States retaliated firing Tomahawk missiles suspected terrorist camps eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According U.S. intelligence sources, camps were being used train members bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America is looking excuse fire more rockets our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, which has posted dlrs 5 million reward bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks Afghanistan. Saqib, who heads judicial inquiry established Taliban investigate terrorism charges bin Laden, says United States has become insecure. America fears its shadow ... every part world it is afraid and sees every danger connected bin Laden, he said interview Afghan capital Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered honored guest his Taliban hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demands host guarantee his guest protection. So far Saqib says he has no evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activities. The Taliban have refused turn bin Laden United States, they say if there is evidence they will try him Islamic law. In 90 percent Afghanistan ruled Taliban harsh brand Islamic justice has been imposed, including death penalty. We want good relations United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, they have respect our ways, he said. Saqib said his inquiry will wind Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence bin Laden case will be closed  least Taliban. Bin Laden is not sinful man ... America has been silent ... they have given no evidence, he said. It is too shameful America who is now seen all that world have no reason go bin Laden. The man accused orchestrating U.S. embassy bombings Tanzania and Kenya was declared free man Friday Afghanistan, where he has lived years permission hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, who control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday closed their three-week inquiry allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging war terror United States. It's over, and America has not presented any evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press interview Supreme Court building Afghan capital, Kabul. Without any evidence, bin Laden is man sin. ... He is free man. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political activity is banned and he has agreed respect that, Taliban information minister said statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is rich man, saying Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, claim not immediately corroborated. One clear unstated objectives last August's raid Afghanistan was kill Osama bin Laden and many his lieutenants possible, administration officials now acknowledge. According officials, White House lawyers conducted secret review months attack and concluded that such operations are legal U.S. and international law. The officials said raid was timed so that more 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps moment when Central Intelligence Agency believed he would be meeting there his chief operatives. A 1976 executive order bars anyone working U.S. government plotting or carrying out assassinations. But officials said White House legal opinion drafted Afghan strike asserts that president has authority target infrastructure terrorist groups that are attacking Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official said this week that infrastructure bin Laden's group is mostly human. As we said time Aug. 20 strike, objective was disrupt training, organization and infrastructure bin Laden terrorist network Khost camps, said David C. Leavy, spokesman National Security Council White House. Targeting infrastructure, officials acknowledged, can also mean destroying leadership terrorist group. Command and control enemy is justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration officials said they never discussed killing bin Laden their planning sessions. His death, they said interviews attack, would simply have been side benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that bin Laden was camp day attack, he appears have left unscathed missiles hit. Officials said there were reports that least one his senior lieutenants may have died attack, and that total casualties complex were 50 and 100. Administration spokesmen have drawn distinction attempting kill specific person bin Laden and attacking group people who command terrorist organization. Administration officials have denied August that raid was intended kill bin Laden, Saudi exile who has been charged federal prosecutors leading global war U.S. interests. He has been linked Aug. 7 bombing two U.S. embassies East Africa. But less subtle explanation was offered Oct. 13 Defense Secretary William Cohen, who said visit Saudi Arabia that United States had been going bin Laden and his colleagues. We weren't quite successful, Cohen continued, we sent message. Kenneth Bacon, Pentagon spokesman, said secretary had not retracted his statements. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that administration believed that it had legal right use deadly force terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization was significant concern Clinton administration bombing U.S. embassies East Africa. Last spring, officials said, U.S. intelligence considered daring raid Afghanistan capture Saudi exile. Officials said that roughly same time, White House drafted legal justification military attacks terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, provided legal basis August fire cruise missiles meeting which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would be gathered. The review, National Security Council, was basis saying this operation not violate presidential order banning assassinations. That ban was imposed President Ford 1975, congressional investigators uncovered evidence that CIA had plotted assassinate Fidel Castro, Cuban leader, and others. The order said: No person employed by, or acting behalf United States government shall engage in, or conspire engage in, assassination. While it is, its face, sweeping and unqualified ban, it has been subject interpretation and intense debate years. In 1986, Reagan administration responded terrorist attack U.S. soldiers Germany bombing raid Libya. The targets included residence Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. And Gulf War, U.S. forces used powerful bombs attempt kill Saddam Hussein, president Iraq. The legal review conducted White House would appear provide precedent future operations similar circumstances.

6,"He was classic small-town prodigy, creativity big-city profiteer. When there was no shot take, he invented new one. When there was no one pass to, he reconfigured play teammate was open. Larry Bird, Indiana countryside or Boston Garden, was luminous exception governing rule. That is why, six years his retirement National Basketball Association, his name is again basketball's most prominent, beginning his induction Hall Fame 7,000 Bird watchers Civic Center here Friday night. Deservedly enshrined forever exceptional, he again becomes Bird, exception, case study contentious and potentially disastrous labor war. No, not really, Bird said, when I asked whether he is troubled likelihood his legendary name soon representing symbol greed unsympathetic millions. There's always player's name attached these things. I know time I was very happy it. That would have been 1988, when Celtics wanted compensate Bird $4.9 million bonus push his back pain, go their savior. Three years later, contract arbitration involving Knicks' Patrick Ewing, agent David Falk would contend that NBA conspired Celtics circumvent salary cap, order satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I am sure, would agree that this salary cap is convoluted enough give anyone headache, so let's just say it is cap that does not exist when team is negotiating one its own. The process unsealing cap re-sign particular player eventually became known making use Larry Bird exception. And that is where we stand, this onetime exception has become very expensive rule owners don't want play anymore. I can understand sides, said Bird, safely middle, Bird, former exception, and Bird, present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without getting exception, I think it's very important players stay same place. Important, he meant, franchise stability and fan identification. You have son who is 7 years old, he goes 7 17 10 years you've played, Bird said. A lot people Boston told me that they had followed me, time they were very young when they were college. The Bird years numbered only three Celtics championships, he was best player pro basketball's most famous team ever had. He and Magic Johnson created basketball renaissance that began college title showdown Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, infectious smile. They stood pass, team play, now their decade selflessness has given way one selfishness. The NBA Michael Jordan reached greater heights anyone imagined it could, it is league that now suffers sickness soul. If Larry and Magic hadn't done what they did, we might not survive what we're go through, said Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, Bill Walton, stood him night that, he said, gave closure his playing career. The owners, always, are exaggerating their misery, this time, it is much easier not root players. The president union is Ewing, who one day commands players boycott world championships because NBA's corporate fingerprints are them, then next day helps himself some television commentary work David Stern's women's annex. Ewing leads fight protect $100 million contracts 21-year-olds who have achieved not single playoff victory, linked big payoffs agents his friend Falk. The battle is waged name salary cap that makes exceptions unexceptional, rewards everyone if they were Bird. I believe that any field there has be allowance truly special ones, Walton said. But that group is very small. When I was growing this sport, only players who got recognition were champions, ones who always made you feel good game, sports. That's how Larry and Magic played, always dreaming special team. It wasn't hype, money. That is not quite case, nor should it have been. Bird was businessman's ball player day he arrived, his flannel shirts and blue-collar ethic. He hired late Bob Woolf, one original heavy-hitting agents, and got himself record rookie contract. Then he went out and turned 29-victory catastrophe 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, honest exception rule. Despite modest encouragement new proposal delivered players owners, National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled first two weeks regular season, first time league's 51-year history that it will lose games labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three and half hours meetings concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came players association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners said they would respond Friday. We tried our best today try do what was possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 games blemish, NBA now joins National Hockey League, National Football League and Major League Baseball having lost games labor dispute. Taking account that three- four-week period would be needed training camp and free-agent signings season starts, league said it would decide two weeks whether make further cancellations. I'm very sad and disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it be collective failure, I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do things that I think are best interests game. And I believe this is. The decision came what sides agreed were most substantive talks owners imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended meeting Stern, Granik and five members ownership committee  Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston and Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks featured what players association implied were bevy concessions made owners that they felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owners. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point has been owners' insistence salary cap exceptions, implementation which they believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players not discuss elimination Larry Bird exception  clause that allows player secure any amount money he wants re-signing his current team  they address exception their taxation proposal. The main points were follows:  A 50 percent tax would be imposed salary earned $18 million, clause that would affect only few players who exercised their Bird rights. For example, if player made $20 million, team would be forced put $1 million fund that would most likely be distributed low-revenue teams. There could be provisions made some players, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We don't want do anything that would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels same way. The proposal is similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiations, it would not be nearly liberal.  A salary cap credit would go effect if league pays out more 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure that number reduces salary cap next year. If figure was $29 million salary cap, then 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would have assurance that salary cap would go least $2 million credit goes effect.  Also, if 63-percent threshold is met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raises 10 percent or rate growth league revenues. The union said this clearly addresses league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement because 57.1 percent revenue was going salaries, 63-percent figure would probably have come substantially owners agree such proposal.  Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would be contractually obligated same team first four years his deal. Currently, rookie scale is three years and includes clause that enables player exercise his Bird rights two seasons  clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota.  Finally, players agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took place testing performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners included their last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary  currently $272,500  and creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap being able sign one free agent year average salary  currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers eye and say we made valiant effort. Asked if players would finally be tested financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's not us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position all has been we don't want accept bad deal. Granik said refunds fans would be made end calendar month and that first refund would include monies canceled preseason games. He estimated losses hundreds millions dollars. I think we have serious concern whether tax system can address kind needs we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. Added Stern, We owe it fans go back and look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, we're going spend next two days see if we can give favorable response. Though decision cancel games was not surprising, it represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered out deal 1995 start training camp sole notion not missing games and preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come such accord. I'd think these our last games we have cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly not all season that's jeopardy. In decision that will almost certainly lead first work stoppage National Basketball Association history, league Monday announced cancellation all 114 preseason games. Citing stalled negotiations Players Association new collective bargaining agreement, league officials said they would decide next week whether cancel first week regular season games. While decision had been expected 10 days, it nonetheless sent strong signal that owners and players will probably be willing cancel least part regular season order settle their labor dispute. Both sides agree that it would take least three weeks hold abbreviated training camps and sign 200 free agents new contracts. Privately, officials sides do not believe season will start scheduled Nov. 3 or December. Unlike Major League Baseball, National Football League and National Hockey League, NBA has never lost regular-season game labor strife. Since we're not negotiating, you have conclude it's very likely that we're going miss some part regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night. We'll try and defer any decisions last minute, right now it does not look good. The two sides will meet Thursday  their first official bargaining session Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern and group owners walked out meeting dismissing merits new proposal players. Neither Granik nor players association executive director Billy Hunter sounded if this week's meeting would go long way signing new agreement  precursor playing again. I don't think you have any choice miss games this point, Hunter said. In fact, I think they've intended it all along. They've locked us out, they've refused negotiate and they've given us proposal that's ludicrous. Not only are sides still awaiting outcome arbitration decision that is due Oct. 18 - Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts should be paid lockout  owners and players also are making time win public opinion they test their fans' loyalties canceling games. Monday 11 cities throughout country, players are holding make-shift press conferences training-camp venues, NBA arenas and gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, union president, and several teammates will speak SUNY-Purchase Purchase, N.Y., where Knicks train season. With training camp originally scheduled open Oct. 6, message players is clear: if owners would call end lockout, we would be ready play today. About 100 players are expected attend, speak and sign autographs fans afterward. I wish they would put their energies trying negotiate deal rather various other things that they've been doing, Granik said. The dispute is essentially how owners and players will judiciously divvy $2 billion income. It began last year contention owners that their employees were receiving more their fair share pot. The owners were allowed terminate current agreement because clause that enabled them do so player salaries reached 53.8 percent total basketball-related income. The owners say that figure is currently hovering 57.1 percent. Though many economic issues need be resolved, main point contention labor agreement expired and owners declared lockout July 1 has been clause which allows teams pay their free agents they want, regardless salary-cap rules governing NBA's 29 teams. Called Larry Bird exception, it was created allow Hall Fame Boston Celtics forward re-sign Celtics end his career. Michael Jordan exercised clause last two years Chicago Bulls, earning more $30 million season  figures more $5 million more what team is allowed spend all its players. But exorbitant salaries paid several unproven stars last few years and $100 million deals sprouting routinely, owners are determined swing income pendulum back themselves enforcing restricted salary cap  hard cap  and putting ceiling how much one player could earn. Last year, players received $1 billion dollars salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are guaranteed increase that number 20 percent next four years, Granik said prepared statement. Our proposals would result average player salary more $3.1 million and minimum salary 10-year veterans $750,000. Unfortunately, union leadership has been unwilling give any serious consideration what we have offered. Hunter labeled those claims optimistic projections, and shot number new proposals presented players Sept. 25. If they had left current deal place, we would have gotten much that anyway, he added. All we're saying is, we're not position accept hard cap. Monday's decision cancel preseason came less two weeks NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled first week exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated that losing exhibition season would cost league $35 million and $40 million. Decisions cancellations regular season games are expected be made next week, he added. A league official said games would be canceled blocks one or two weeks, depending circumstances negotiations. Thursday's bargaining session has suddenly become last hope starting season time. Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, I have no reason believe they will Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course they don't expect much get done. When Russ and David decide negotiations are going be real and substantive, then something will happen. What they're banking now is that players are going miss paychecks and cave November. It's if they've ingested something that has pass. And once it passes, then they'll negotiate. The first substantive talks more two months opposing sides National Basketball Association's labor dispute came and went Thursday hint settlement. Still, five-hour meeting that was described cordial league and almost two bulls letting little steam players association produced another scheduled talks next Tuesday. Barring major compromise, that will not be enough time preserve full season and prevent league losing its first regular-season games labor strife November. Russ Granik, NBA's deputy commissioner, said league would wait next week's meeting deciding cancel regular-season games. He also discussed possibility significantly shortened season. We haven't made determination that you need this exact number games order have representative season, Granik said. But we recognize that certain point we can't possibly sell our fans that we're having NBA season. Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. We have few months we have face that decision. Perhaps only progress involved Thursday conference room midtown Manhattan hotel was question-and-answer session league's latest proposal players. Patrick Ewing, union president, and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended meeting union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union lawyers. No owners were present, Granik, Commissioner David Stern and league's lawyers spent most day explaining intricacies two-week-old proposal players. At one point two parties broke lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voices and accused each other handling their constituencies poorly, participant meeting said. But two were seen shaking hands and laughing meeting concluded shortly 3 p.m. There was some venting sides, Hunter said. We've been placid and very respectful. Today, we took coats and we were inclined take gloves little bit. Having done that, I think it kind loosened sides. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort look us any kind nuance they can find course negotiations that might, some way or another, give some indication that while we're mouthing one thing we might be open something else. We're looking their body language, too. I don't think that they're ready make deal. The last formal meeting sides Aug. 6 ended when Stern and owners abruptly marched out they had received proposal players. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association and players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more 200 players guaranteed contracts should be paid lockout. If players win, owners will be liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed appeal if they lose. The league already has sued players Feerick's jurisdiction. If we win, I think it just emboldens spirit and resolve players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no guarantee that it will end lockout. It only means they have pay some 200 players, and they've indicated us their intent file immediate appeal and take it far they have order avoid payment. So if he does rule our favor, most it's hollow victory. The players aren't going get paid Nov. 15 any circumstance, Hunter said. If owners win, it will remove last wild card players had been holding. The sides have not negotiated last Tuesday, when union proposed superstar tax highest contracts. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking that tax be imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, then said sides would be best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, union is holding meeting all NBA players and agents advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense where players are, what they consider be reasonable and what they're willing do order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout was imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 that they would not honor guaranteed deals. In six-day hearing summer, union argued that owners should have protected themselves being liable guaranteed salaries work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, and it was approved league. The union used existence that clause argue that all other teams should have protected themselves similarly. Most players are due receive their first paychecks Nov. 15, although dozen or so had clauses entitling them be paid summer. None has received paycheck. The NBA argued that tenet labor law allows employers withhold pay employees lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify. He said it was his understanding when he negotiated old labor agreement 1995 that players would not be paid if owners chose reopen agreement and impose lockout. More 220 National Basketball Association players guaranteed contracts will find out Monday whether they are be paid management lockout, long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage league's dispute players and have major ramifications American sports-labor law. But neither players nor owners are counting ruling arbitrator, John Feerick, speed negotiations, especially if Feerick finds favor players, award that could approach $800 million salaries. NBA attorneys have indicated union that if decision goes management, they will seek have it vacated appealing U.S. District Court Manhattan and then, if necessary, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court Appeals, process that could prevent players getting paid several months. The NBA has already canceled first two weeks regular season because labor dispute. The league has other litigation pending U.S. District Court Manhattan. If players win ruling, NBA intends renew its motion disqualify Feerick. The motion was brought last summer grounds that no collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction hear matter. If he rules our favor, I think it emboldens spirit and resolve players, said Billy Hunter, union executive director. But we understand that won't end lockout. It just means they have pay 200-some players. And there is still other litigation alive that may take while resolve. At most, it's hollow victory. Feerick will have taken full 30 days render his decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully. There is no precedent locked-out athletes being paid. During NBA summer lockout 1995, players who missed paychecks not file grievance. Neither National Hockey League players who were locked out first three months 1994-95 season. The union argued that owners should have protected themselves inserting clauses non-payment lockouts and strikes individual player contracts. In support its arguments, union pointed clauses few individual player contracts that contained language precluding payment lockout. The league is relying basic tenets labor law, which hold that employees not be paid strikes or lockouts. A ruling union would be significant all future negotiations players and owners. The deterrent factor lockout is that employees subject collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once agreement expires and they are unable reach new agreement. If Feerick finds favor players, there will be no economic incentive those guaranteed contracts reach agreement quickly. They would essentially be paid not playing basketball. If Feerick finds favor owners, reality not being paid may spur players reach agreement more quickly. But Hunter disputed this notion, and conference call Friday talked openly entire season's being canceled players would back away their ultimate goals. I'm not all concerned, Hunter said. There's been no demonstration that there's going be change our resolve. After players saw these proposals league and recent posturing NBA owners, well, I had two players call me and tell me, if need be, they'd be willing hock everything they've got. Another significant development may be thedeparture many players Europe dispute is settled, according least two player agents. I think it would be case-by-case basis, yes, there's already some people talking that, said Bill Strickland, member union's agents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member committee, said he would explore possibility that one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign professional team Greece. We wouldn't look void his deal team, Kauffman said. But we would want him have right him work temporarily he could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said league has approved idea players' earning living elsewhere lockout is settled. Proposals exchanged last week that included concept luxury-tax system player salaries appeared reflect first signs progress negotiations lockout began July 1. But sides have termed figures each other's proposal unacceptable, and it was unclear whether either side was willing compromise. I don't think we should get too carried away possibilities just yet, Granik said. When they explored idea tax system, we were taking players their word that they wanted make some headway. But call their first proposal meaningless is charitable. They proposed something that has no impact. As it stands, that can't be solution. The owners' goal is slow growth player salaries relation leaguewide revenue next three years, while players want keep earning much possible. As labor battles go, current one National Basketball Association and its players is weird sports standards. There is real possibility that most, if not all, coming season will be canceled. In this union battle it is interests best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating discussion. And here it is some workers, not management, who are trying make union disappear. The current arrangement has produced unbalanced pay scale immense proportions. Last year more players ever received union minimum, then $242,000 rookies or $272,000 veterans. The number players making $1 million $2 million year  middle class, NBA terms  fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. This should not be surprise. Sports is entertainment business, not movies. Big stars get millions, while most get union scale. Over years, NBA efforts stem rise salaries have failed. The most important loophole its salary cap lets team sign its free agent it is willing pay. When that was adopted, it was assumed that no team would pay lot more rival could pay. But it has not worked out that way. In current negotiation, league has offered guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 percent next four years, $1 billion $1.2 billion, and says it is open proposals split that money any way players want, whether raising minimum salary or guaranteeing raises veterans. The union says it is worried that middle class, seems determined preserve free market. The league got its broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, agree pay this year's television fees whether or not there are any games broadcast. (They will be paid back later years, either reduced fees or extra games show.) Owners hoped players would think management was willing wait them out, and come terms only small part season canceled. But union is acting unhurried. It turned aside requests negotiations this week, saying players had meet first. Then there is issue union suicide, tactic that was rejected players 1995. The idea is that if players had no union, it would be illegal antitrust laws owners collude. The sky would be limit. That tactic might fail. The courts could reject union decertification vote sham, and any case some players may fear that teams would feel free offer less old union minimum. But if players go that route, it could be long time real negotiations get going. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, warned owners this week that prolonged lockout could destroy league's popularity. That was what all seers said four years ago, when baseball's World Series was canceled labor troubles. But fan memories are relatively short, and now baseball seems more popular ever. With that mind, owners and players may choose battle months. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association and players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more 200 players guaranteed contracts should be paid lockout. If players win, owners will be liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed appeal if they lose. The league already has sued players Feerick's jurisdiction.

Patrick Ewing not want sound striking longshoreman demanding health benefits. I'm not going try and put it dollars and cents. But Ewing, president National Basketball Association Players Association, played public-relations game Tuesday expounding themes labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted proposals. On day when training camps were scheduled begin, players country held news conferences 14 NBA cities proclaim themselves ready practice regular season. We want show public that we, players, want play, said Ewing, who was flanked five teammates. Today is supposed be start training camp. We want practice and we want season start. But unfortunately, owners have locked us out and season has been postponed. The owners and players are scheduled hold their first bargaining session Aug. 6 Thursday Manhattan. Neither side is predicting progress signing new collective bargaining agreement and beginning season scheduled Nov. 3. The league canceled entire 114-game preseason Monday. Next week, it will consider canceling first-ever regular season games league history. With wide philosophical differences how $2 billion annual income should be distributed, sides have privately said they don't expect play regular season game December. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, offered glimmer hope. He spoke optimistically potential quick resolution. Standing few feet away Ewing, he said, I hope owners and commissioner have gotten message: that we're serious deal. I'm prepared make quantum leap. I don't think we're that far off. I think there's lot jockeying, lot rhetoric and lot games being played. But if and when owners decide they want deal, then they'll get one. But soon after, he began lambasting owners' latest proposal, which includes eventual phasing out Larry Bird exception  clause that enables free agents earn unlimited salaries their current teams. That clause represents major rift negotiations. Owners would implement restrictive salary cap that would eventually put ceiling how much one player can earn. I don't know if this is going come speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrenched what they want, which is hard cap. And we feel hard cap, we players, cannot survive. We would have be stupid and ignorant accept that deal. Said Hunter, If you go their proposal, it's just joke. It's step backwards. I cannot understand it. If intent was reach agreement this late stage or negotiate earnest, this was wrong way go it. League officials not respond players' comments. All we want is our fair share and we feel they're trying take that away us, Ewing said. `There's perception that we're strike. It's other way around. We've been locked out. Besides Ewing, other Knicks included former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston and John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed briefly. When media horde closed in, however, third-year forward went look his late-arriving teammates practice facility. He was stopped gym door, which was locked. They locked us out, said Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's got get that corrected. It's not us. They're ones that closed us down. The stalemate has elicited talks possibly bringing mediator coming weeks, Major League Baseball 1994 help solve its labor dispute. But players are convinced commissioner David Stern and owners are set testing their resolve any genuine headway can be made negotiations. That means missing paychecks November, something Ewing said players are prepared do. Both sides are still awaiting outcome arbitration decision that is due Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts should be paid lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage one side. But if players lose arbitration, more 400 athletes  many extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial obligations  will have their allegiances instantly tested. It's they want see how strong we are, Ewing said. Based proposals we've received, we're very strong. So far, it seems though NBA is dug their position, Buck Williams said. I don't think they're too concerned this point making deal. He added, We're far apart Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroiled labor dispute its players, Tuesday canceled first two weeks 1998-99 season. It is first time league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three and half hours meetings concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came players association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners said they would respond Friday. We tried our best today try do what was possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 games blemish, NBA now joins National Hockey League, National Football League and Major League Baseball having lost games labor dispute. Taking account that three- four-week period would be needed training camp and free-agent signings season starts, league said it would decide two weeks whether make further cancellations. I'm very sad and disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it be collective failure, I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do things that I think are best interests game. And I believe this is. The decision came what sides agreed were most substantive talks owners imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended meeting Stern, Granik and five members ownership committee  Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston and Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks featured what players association implied were bevy concessions made owners that they felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owners. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point has been owners' insistence salary cap exceptions, implementation which they believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players not discuss elimination Larry Bird exception  clause that allows player secure any amount money he wants re-signing his current team  they address exception their taxation proposal. The main points were follows:  A 50 percent tax would be imposed salary earned $18 million, clause that would affect only few players who exercised their Bird rights. For example, if player made $20 million, team would be forced put $1 million fund that would most likely be distributed low-revenue teams. There could be provisions made some players, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We don't want do anything that would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels same way. The proposal is similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiations, it would not be nearly liberal.  A salary cap credit would go effect if league pays out more 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure that number reduces salary cap next year. If figure was $29 million salary cap, then 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would have assurance that salary cap would go least $2 million credit goes effect.  Also, if 63-percent threshold is met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raises 10 percent or rate growth league revenues. The union said this clearly addresses league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement because 57.1 percent revenue was going salaries, 63-percent figure would probably have come substantially owners agree such proposal.  Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would be contractually obligated same team first four years his deal. Currently, rookie scale is three years and includes clause that enables player exercise his Bird rights two seasons  clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota.  Finally, players agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took place testing performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners included their last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary  currently $272,500  and creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap being able sign one free agent year average salary  currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers eye and say we made valiant effort. Asked if players would finally be tested financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's not us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position all has been we don't want accept bad deal. Granik said refunds fans would be made end calendar month and that first refund would include monies canceled preseason games. He estimated losses hundreds millions dollars. I think we have serious concern whether tax system can address kind needs we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. Added Stern, We owe it fans go back and look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, we're going spend next two days see if we can give favorable response. Though decision cancel games was not surprising, it represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered out deal 1995 start training camp sole notion not missing games and preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come such accord. I'd think these our last games we have cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly not all season that's jeopardy. ","The National Basketball Association joined the NHL, the NFL and baseball when it canceled first the preseason games then two weeks of regular season.In litigation that is complicated by a dispute over the distribution of nearly $2 billion in league income, the main sticking point is the owner's insistence on a salary cap without exceptions.Top players are avoiding discussion of the Larry Bird exception, which allows a player to secure any amount he wants in resigning with his current team except as it applies to their taxation proposal.Also pending is an arbiter's decision as to whether players will be paid during the lockout.","The Larry Bird exception has been used to pay some NBA players much more than the salary cap allows.Stalled labor dispute over NBA salaries cancels preseason games and threatens regular season games.NBA owners and players plan meeting, which is unsuccessful.Players submit proposal at next meeting.Owners to respond by Fri.First 2 weeks of the season, 99 games, are cancelled.An arbitrator will decide on Mon. whether or not NBA players with guaranteed salary contracts should be paid during the owners' lockout.As the NBA labor battle goes on, most, if not all, season games may be cancelled.Lesser paid players may suffer if union doesn't survive.","In a dispute over a new collective bargaining agreement the National Basketball Association owners declared a lockout on July 1, 1998.They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap.The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible.On Oct. 5 all 114 preseason games were cancelled.The players then proposed a 50% tax on salaries above $18 million that the owners rejected.On Oct. 13 the NBA cancelled the first two weeks of the regular season.By Oct. 21 the entire season seemed in jeopardy in the interests of the best paid.","In a dispute between the owners and NBA players over how to divide the $2 billion in league-wide income, all preseason and the first 99 1998-1999 regular season games were cancelled.The Larry Bird exception, a clause in the old agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents any amount, regardless of salary-cap rules, is the major issue.The owners want a restricted salary cap.The players have proposed a superstar tax, and the owners have presented a counter proposal, but negotiations have stalled.Meanwhile, both sides are awaiting a ruling by arbitrator Feerick on whether $800 million in guaranteed salaries will be paid during the lockout."
7,"Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign oust President Laurent Kabila Internet. We have explain world audience who we are and what we're fighting for, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said Friday. Besides, (Kabila) government has been using Internet tell their side story. The 56-year-old history professor University Dar es Salaam Tanzania said supporters Congolese Rally Democracy United States have created web site rebellion. The site  www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm  has been set donor-supported Prairenet Community Network eastern Illinois. The rebels are coalition ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent Congo's 400 tribes. After initial lightning advance far west Africa's third-largest nation, rebels were stopped outskirts capital, Kinshasa, troops Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila. Since then, rebels have been confined chunk territory extreme eastern part country where their rebellion was declared Aug. 2. Wamba said rebels control 40 percent Congo, area 15 million people. So far, Kabila has refused negotiate rebels, accusing them being puppets neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Posting rebel mission statement Internet is just part media campaign. Last week, Wamba dispatched two his top aides United States and Europe lobby political support and raise public awareness conflict Congo. World leaders, diplomats and are not familiar enough our cause. They still talk Tutsis leading rebellion. Well, I'm not Tutsi, Wamba said. Jacques Depelchin, movement's vice president and former lecturer University California Berkeley, met Washington earlier this week U.S. special envoy Great Lakes region Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and congressmen, Wamba said. Rebels eastern Congo Saturday said they shot passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers strategic airport facing rebel assault. A Congo Airlines executive said victims were civilians being evacuated Kindu, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east capital, Kinshasa. Neither claim could be confirmed independently. Stavros Papaioannou, president airline's management committee, said missile hit rear engine Boeing jet aircraft took Kindu airport. A rebel military commander, who requested anonymity, said plane was carrying troops, although he not explain how he knew this. He said plane was shot while approaching Kindu air base, where rebels had deployed least two surface-to-air missiles and more 3,500 troops preparation final assault government-held town. Alexis Tambwe Mwamba, one rebel leaders, said rebel stronghold Goma, 380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast Kalima, that fighters had intercepted government radio messages Kindu and knew advance arrival aircraft. He said government had been using Boeing 727 fly troops and ammunition Kindu several days. Papaioannou, citing, 6th graf pvs After day fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, strategic town and airbase eastern Congo used government halt their advances. Etienne Ngangura, rebel spokesman, said rebel fighters were Kindu and had taken adjacent, large airbase, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west Goma, rebel stronghold. We're town and airport, Ngangura said. He offered no details and report could not be confirmed independently. Rebel military sources said fighting continued Kindu where rebels were apparently meeting stiff resistance. The rebels  ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members President Laurent Kabila's army and opposition politicians  took arms Aug. 2 accusing Kabila mismanagement, corruption and creating division Congo's 400 tribes. The rebels have targeted Kindu late August, when they were forced retreat outskirts capital, Kinshasa, troops Angola and Zimbabwe came Kabila's aid. Troops moving south Kisangani, largest city rebel control, and moving west, had made steady gains Kindu, which government apparently used build force planned counter-offensive. Apart Kindu, Ngangura said rebel fighters took Buta, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north Kisangani and main road northern Congo that links Sudan and Central African Republic. Also Sunday, Ngangura said rebels took Bumba, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest Kisangani. These reports could not be confirmed independently either. Rebel leaders said victory Kindu would confirm rebel strength, boost fighters' morale and perhaps persuade join them. The rebels want direct negotiations Kabila. But president has so far refused, accusing rebels being puppets Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila has accused orchestrating rebellion. The conflict Central Africa has drawn most Congo's nine neighbors, and regional diplomatic initiatives have so far failed stop it. The bloody bandages injured rebels trucked back this rear base Wednesday offered evidence that three-day battle strategic air base Kindu was not going well those fighting oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. It was impossible say who had upper hand battle Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using launch airstrikes eastern towns and assemble ground troops. Rebel commander Richard Mondo said shelling and ground attacks, which began Monday, continued Wednesday. Mondo said he was expecting air shipments munitions bolster rebel offensive.

The rebel victory would also open routes Katanga and Eastern Kasai provinces, rich copper and diamonds. The rebels targeted Kindu late August, when they were forced retreat their march extreme western Congo outskirts Kinshasa Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops bail out Kabila. Rebel commanders say their 2,000 fighters face estimated 5,000 government troops, apparently reinforced Sudanese soldiers. Sudan denies involvement Congo.

Rebels attacked village western Uganda and killed six civilians soldiers drove them off, military spokesman said Thursday. The attack occurred overnight Wednesday village Chiondo Kasese, 270 kilometers (170 miles) west capital Kampala, said spokesman, who identified himself only Lt. Majera. Majera said attackers were believed be rebels Allied Democratic Forces who operate bases foothills Rwenzori Mountains that straddle Uganda-Congolese border. He said rebels likely fled back their bases attack. Majera said attackers avoided nearby army post when they shot village. It was gunfire that alerted soldiers, he said, adding that they killed two assailants.

They are tired insecurity and have little hope things will get better, said Kasuku, son Italian settler and Rwandan Tutsi refugee mother. On Aug. 2, Tutsis, political opponents, and disenchanted members President Laurent Kabila's army took arms, accusing Kabila corruption, nepotism and fostering tribal strife. The war has split Africa's third-largest nation government-held west and south and rebel-controlled east, and no political settlement is sight. Goma, small trading post head Lake Kivu eastern Congo, is no longer starting point tourists trekking see mountain gorillas. Today, its decaying buildings, empty shops and crumbling guest houses are home rebel leaders, soldiers and people displaced violence. The rebels have promised revitalize economy reducing taxes boost investment. They also say they will pay civil servants  who haven't seen paycheck months or years  and invite investors buy tea and coffee farms and gold and diamond-mining concessions. But war has also increased tribal animosity  especially ethnic Tutsis, tiny highly successful minority eastern region. In 1990, liberating effect early political freedoms revived unresolved land disputes and led clashes Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus  who had settled eastern Congo 1930s. Mai-Mai warriors  armed youths Hunde and Nande tribes who accuse Tutsis stealing their land, also joined fighting. In 1994, nearly 1 million Rwandan refugees engulfed Goma, town 30,000. Among them were former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who took part 1994 genocide neighboring Rwanda which more half million Tutsis were killed. They brought anti-Tutsi ideology them and sold weapons Congolese tribes, who then joined persecution Tutsi landowners and ranchers. People misunderstood political freedoms anarchy, said Safari Ngezayo, farmer and hotel owner. We tried mediate Tutsis and Hutus and other tribes, how can you talk people who have blood their hands and genocide their heads? In late 1996, Congolese Tutsis backed Rwanda attacked refugee camps, dislodged Hutu fighters and forced most refugees back home border. After eight-month rebellion backed Rwanda and Uganda, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled May 1997, and Kabila took power. He quickly changed name country Congo, Zaire. Few people northeastern Congo expected another rebellion so soon. I blame our politicians. Then I blame foreign powers who kept meddling our affairs. It is they who supported Mobutu and Kabila, and we are paying interest, Kasuku said. Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign oust President Laurent Kabila Internet. We have explain world audience who we are and what we're fighting for, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said Friday. Besides, (Kabila) government has been using Internet tell their side story. The 56-year-old history professor University Dar es Salaam Tanzania said supporters Congolese Rally Democracy United States have created web site rebellion. The site  www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm  has been set donor-supported Prairenet Community Network eastern Illinois. The rebels are coalition ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent Congo's 400 tribes. After initial lightning advance far west Africa's third-largest nation, rebels were stopped outskirts capital, Kinshasa, troops Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila. Since then, rebels have been confined chunk territory extreme eastern part country where their rebellion was declared Aug. 2. Wamba said rebels control 40 percent Congo, area 15 million people. So far, Kabila has refused negotiate rebels, accusing them being puppets neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Posting rebel mission statement Internet is just part media campaign. Last week, Wamba dispatched two his top aides United States and Europe lobby political support and raise public awareness conflict Congo. World leaders, diplomats and are not familiar enough our cause. They still talk Tutsis leading rebellion. Well, I'm not Tutsi, Wamba said. Jacques Depelchin, movement's vice president and former lecturer University California Berkeley, met Washington earlier this week U.S. special envoy Great Lakes region Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and congressmen, Wamba said. Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were poised overrun important government-held air base eastern Congo  battle that could determine future two-month Congolese war. After trekking several hundred kilometers (miles) dense tropical forest, thousands rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) Kindu, where troops loyal President Laurent Kabila have used air base launching pad offensives. If rebels succeed capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west Goma, rebel headquarters, this will remove last government stronghold eastern Congo and pave way rebel advance mineral-rich southwest. A rebel defeat, other hand, would put coalition ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members Congolese army and opposition politicians defensive and give boost Kabila's efforts fend rebellion launched Aug. 2. Rebel commander Richard Mondo said troops had fired artillery rounds Kindu Monday and early Tuesday, sending population fleeing out town. Advance units had crossed Lualaba River north and were meeting stiff resistance town, he said. Since assault town began 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), least 18 enemy soldiers were killed and 40 taken prisoner, Mondo said, adding number was expected rise. The rebels took casualties, too, number was not known. One rebel soldier was wounded stomach, he said. He said large Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) town, was deserted and no one appeared be control. Our soldiers are town and fighting is continuing, rebel battalion commander Arthur Mulunda said Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast Kindu. There was no independent confirmation rebel claims. On Sunday, spokesman Goma boasted that Kindu was already rebel control. In Kinshasa, government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Monday Congolese army was firmly control Kindu. Mulunda's 1,500-strong battalion walked 240 kilometers (150 miles) Bukavu southern end Lake Kivu Kalima, which fell rebels Saturday little resistance. The rebel fighters, clad brand-new Rwandan-made dark green uniforms, rubber rain boots and toting Kalashnikov assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, said they were advancing slowly lush forest palm trees and razor-sharp tall grass. We've been resting lot. It took us two weeks get here, Mondo said. The rebels are now using Kalima, town one main street, scattered houses and mud-and-brick huts, supply troops rice, cooking oil, drinking water and ammunition. A small, grass airstrip 8 kilometers (5 miles) away Kalima is just barely long enough rebels' Russian-built Antonov AN-72 transport aircraft. The rebels have targeted Kindu late August, when they were forced retreat outskirts Kinshasa Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops bail out Kabila. Rebels still control string towns eastern Congo, including Kisangani, country's third-largest city. A day shooting jetliner, Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies pushed Sunday government defense lines, showing confidence victor week-old battle strategic air base. Fighting Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast Elila River bridge, died rebels fired barrage artillery government-held quarters and air base, four kilometers (two miles) away.

Some troops reportedly retreated single road corridor leading out town. On Saturday, rebels said they shot Congolese Boeing 727 which was attempting land Kindu air base 40 troops and ammunition. In Kinshasa, private Congolese Airlines, which owned aircraft, said victims were civilians fleeing fighting Kindu. It was not possible confirm independently either claim. Kalunga said airport, although still government control, was effect unoperational because rebel surface-to-air-missiles deployed nearby. War-weary, physically exhausted and sweaty, hundreds rebel troops and Rwandan soldiers marched dense tropical forest went reinforce their comrades Kindu. After week battling Kindu, rebel fighters had made little progress and failed capture town outright. The rebels see Kindu major prize their two-month revolt President Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse mismanagement, corruption and warmongering Congo's 400 tribes. Kabila has turned Kindu launching pad counteroffensive rebel positions eastern Congo. The conflict has drawn many Congo's neighbors. There are unconfirmed reports that troops Chad and Sudan are involved defending Kindu. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda  former allies who installed him power May 1997 eight-month rebellion  sponsoring new fighting. Both countries say they have legitimate security interests eastern Congo and accuse Kabila failing rid common border area Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. Tanks, aircraft and troops Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting Kabila. The assistance was essential routing early rebel offensive west that had reached outskirts Kinshasa mid-August. The rebels say they now control one-third Kindu and are poised overrun rest town. Under scorching sun, column rebel reinforcements heading Kindu sneaked abandoned roadside hamlets. The silence their march was interrupted only singing crickets and clanging bullet belts hanging soldiers' necks. Soldiers walked empty huts made mud and palm leaves. Some rested shade umbrella-shaped acacia trees. The soldiers stopped night bridge chocolate-colored Elila River, which guards path Kindu.

Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled meet next month Malaysia annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he was not going Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. I'm very concerned how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been treated, Habibie was quoted saying English-language newspaper The Nation. I'm concerned because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed lot benefit his country. Anwar is charismatic politician who was once picked be successor Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he was suddenly fired Mahathir Sept. 2 two differed economic policy. He then began speaking out Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. Anwar has been accused engaging homosexual acts illegal Malaysia law, charges are generally seen pretext his political persecution.

A group high-powered U.S. investors Southeast Asia Monday applauded efforts perk Thailand's staggering economy, saying they had been assured top Thai officials that key economic reform packages will soon be approved. After meetings Thai Cabinet members, including Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, members U.S.-ASEAN Business Council said they were confident future Thailand's economy and promised their companies would continue invest here and elsewhere region. We would be quick observers applaud aggressiveness reform packages that we see being proposed front your government today, said business council chairman George David, who is also chairman and CEO United Technologies Corp. Thailand was hit hard last year's Asian economic crisis, and proposed economic reform legislation focuses resolving massive bad debt private companies, which is hindering recovery. This is very aggressive, good reform. It's very impressive, David said, adding that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda promised Parliament would pass reform measures months, not years. The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council is private organization comprising 300 U.S. companies substantial investments Southeast Asia. David said five executives delegation represented dlrs 300 billion assets. The council's lobbying efforts U.S. and Southeast Asian governments have concentrated removing tariffs and other barriers overseas trade. The delegation will travel Kuala Lumpur Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov. 14-18. David said free trade should be focus discussions government leaders attending. What I hope they will say APEC is very strong affirmation free-trade agenda and very strong affirmation foreign direct investment agenda, he added. In little more week, world's leaders will converge this businesslike city heart Southeast Asia annual meeting Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They could hardly be meeting more provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued trading its currency, ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls flow capital its stock and currency markets, particularly investment overseas. In doing so, Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, effect slammed door global economy that President Clinton and other leaders are coming here champion. Mahathir's decision drew jeers international investors and policy- makers, who warned that Malaysia was seeking quick fix that would retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it odd man out when Asia finally recovered regional malaise. Now, though, Mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls are breathing new life country's moribund economy. Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly September, and there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting spend again. It's nice be able say that we adopted capital controls, economy has improved, said Zainal Aznam Yusof, deputy director Institute Strategic and International Studies, research organization here that helped draft policies. But we want see whether this is strongly sustainable. Critics said it was predictable that capital controls would be short-term tonic Malaysia's economy. Because country is sheltered vagaries capital flows and currency fluctuations, they said, government had been able ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending. Still, mere fact that Malaysia's experiment has yielded some positive results guarantees that issue will come APEC meeting. With Mahathir leading campaign, cause capital controls will have fiery advocate who has penchant getting skin Westerners. Mahathir is very outspoken political leader, said Chia Yew Boon, independent analyst Singapore. There is no way likes Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going be able muzzle him, he added, referring President Jiang China. Policy-makers United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia's gambit is seen successful, other economically weakened countries region, Indonesia, might be tempted try it. So far, Indonesian officials have said they would stick recovery plan devised International Monetary Fund, which stresses economic austerity and open markets. But officials Japan have expressed some sympathy Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, economist Massachusetts Institute Technology, has advocated using them emergency measure. Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia's contention that it needed insulate itself ravages global financial system. He said recent near-collapse prominent American hedge fund underscored how sudden flows capital can have destructive consequences. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based Greenwich, Conn., was nearly wrecked series wrong bets Treasury securities collapse economy Russia prompted flight capital out that country. The LTCM fiasco really provides case study what could go wrong global economy, Yusof said. With capital controls protection, Yusof said Malaysia was picking pieces its shattered economy. In addition growing foreign reserves, he said Malaysia had improved its trade balance and revived consumer purchases durable goods. Foreign investors have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, experts had predicted they would. While foreign direct investment fell September  $142 million, average monthly rate $321 million period January September  it not dry completely. For every comforting statistic, though, critics produce alarming one. They said increase Malaysia's foreign reserves was merely due new capital restrictions, which stipulated that Malaysian currency held country would be worthless unless repatriated Sept. 30. The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined September, several reductions interest rates. So consumers who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping their savings, which means buying spree will end when their savings are depleted. The argument was that imposing capital controls, you'd regain control monetary policy, which would increase supply money and lessen liquidity crunch, said K.S. Jomo, professor political economy University Malaya here. But that's not happening. The biggest flaw Malaysia's policy, Jomo and said, is its timing. With Asian crisis more year old, much foreign capital that was country has already gone. The critics said Mahathir had spooked would-be investors locking ones who used be here. There is case be made temporary imposition capital controls, avert crisis, not respond one, Jomo said. In fact, other Asian currencies, Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht, have actually rebounded Malaysia suspended trading its currency and fixed exchange rate 3.8 ringgit dollar. Analysts liken situation buying insurance policy disaster that has come and gone. More important, capital controls are slowing much-needed corporate and banking reforms. The government's rescue Renong, major conglomerate close ties Mahathir, is going ahead, though some analysts predict government will eventually scrap much-criticized plan. The rescue politically connected companies remains tense issue here. On Monday, trial Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, charges corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's claim that he had approved bailout. Anwar's sensational trial is reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangled politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed his former protege how respond Asian crisis, and he dismissed Anwar day imposing capital controls. During boom times, Mahathir won support his policies wrapping them anti-foreigner language. In speech Monday, he attacked familiar target, saying foreign currency traders are cause currency turmoil, adding: They spread it worldwide. They precipitated current recession every country. But Mahathir's treatment Anwar has stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest Malaysia. With protesters chanting reform orderly streets this city, experts said Mahathir needed capital controls work order soothe country's agitated population. Things will heat if economy does not improve, said Chandra Muzaffar, professor political science University Malaya. Then whole question Mahathir and his leadership will remain issue. In that regard, least, leaders who converge Kuala Lumpur two weeks will be able identify their embattled host. The leaders Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday discuss replacement ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month case that will test country's legal system. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could drop dead any time. But because large number candidates deputy's job ruling United Malays National Organization, decision was not expected quickly. The party leaders, who have been conducting national campaign explain Malaysians why popular Anwar was fired Sept. 2, will also confer what do now that High Court judge has banned all comments Anwar's guilt or innocence. The ruling coalition had scheduled giant rally capital Saturday, aimed drawing youth whom Anwar's campaign reform has most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery 1989, had groomed Anwar, 51, his successor. But he fired his protege his posts deputy prime minister and finance minister grounds he was morally unfit lead. The two had differed economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was threat his 17-year rule. Anwar was also dumped ruling party, and two weeks nationwide rallies which he called government reform and Mahathir's resignation, he was arrested law that allows police hold him indefinitely, and prevent him seeing his family and lawyers. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked thousands streets downtown Kuala Lumpur recent weeks, calling them part plot topple government. Baton-wielding riot police had dispersed crowds tear gas and water cannons, arresting more 100 people. They decided that government should be brought demonstrations, riots, Bernama news agency quoted Mahathir saying Sarawak state Borneo Island. He was expected return Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday chair UMNO meeting. After Anwar appeared court black eye, bruised face, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly presidents Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised possibility they might not attend 18-nation summit Malaysia next month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued be mistreated, Wall Street Journal quoted official Washington saying. Clinton is scheduled go Malaysia meeting Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Wearing neck brace Monday court-ordered hospital checkup, Anwar was ordered stand trial Nov. 2 four charges abusing his powers interfere police investigation. His trial is halt Nov. 14 and resume APEC meetings. He has pleaded innocent all charges, including another corruption count and five charges sodomy. He faces 14 years prison and fine each corruption count and 20 years, whipping, each sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 Internal Security Act, which allows jail trial. Under same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associates and risk national security. As Tuesday, 12 had been released. The UMNO supreme council was expected prepare list top candidates Anwar's job Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, which is close government, listed favorites Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. Other top contenders included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, former finance minister brought back Cabinet June special functions minister charge economic recovery. Rafidah Aziz, international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, former finance minister, were also running. The last time Asia-Pacific region held its annual summit promote free trade, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy wouldn't be next victim Asia's financial crisis. Canada, host country, was criticized some Canada cracking demonstrations Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler time. And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and booming economy were envy planet, joined everyone else urging countries such Thailand and South Korea bite bullet and comply tough economic reforms that International Monetary Fund was demanding. My, how challenges have grown, 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum prepares its November summit Malaysia. Japan  world's second largest economy, and Asia's financial anchor  is suffering its worst recession World War II, and that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job. Suharto, who ruled Indonesia 32 years, was driven out power violent, pro-democracy movement, and world's fourth most populous country is real trouble financially. Wall Street is now coping steep downturn. And though Clinton has promised attend APEC meeting, some people wonder how he can do that while facing impeachment inquiry back home, thanks Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Worse still, Asia's economic crisis is showing signs going global, and more and more economists are criticizing IMF way it is handling its bailouts. Other well-respected economists are going further, questioning whether free-market philosophy doesn't leave some countries too vulnerable chaos major market speculators. In fact, Malaysia isn't only country trying self-defense mechanisms such capital controls. Hong Kong recently spent fortune investing its stock market ward speculators. And Washington is trying figure out what do hedge funds watching its Federal Reserve help bail out major one that was going under, and seeing investments send U.S. dollar tailspin Japan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who made one his typical anti-free-market comments last year's summit, probably could have opened this year's I told you so. But he is having major domestic problems. Mahathir, 72, who is widely credited creating modern Malaysia his 17 years power, dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his expected successor, apparent dispute how battle country's economic mess. Instead stepping aside, Anwar launched reform movement Malaysia that quickly led big rallies demanding that Mahathir step down. The prime minister used riot police thwart protests, and jailed Anwar, charging him corruption and sex crimes, and scheduling his trial Nov. 2. The trial will be interrupted Nov. 12-18 APEC meetings, Mahathir's treatment Anwar and his reform movement already have been criticized APEC members such Australia, Indonesia, Philippines and United States. President B.J. Habibie Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada consider Anwar friend, and Estrada won't say whether he plans attend this year's APEC summit. John S. Wolf, U.S. ambassador APEC, recently acknowledged that it won't be easy APEC members meet Malaysia Asian crisis ricochets world no clear sign what will happen next. But he also said leaders 21 APEC members should aim productive meeting. Wolf said such gatherings give members chance discuss IMF bailout strategies and free-market philosophy, resolve bilateral disputes, and continue reduce tariff rates help struggling countries improve their exports. This has been lousy year general. It has affected all us. It has set APEC back, and there is no silver bullet solve crisis right away, said Wolf. But we should welcome chance work together and develop sense what's possible. So far, APEC has been criticized doing little financial crisis. But next month it hopes complete plan that would lift trade barriers nine key industries: environmental products and services, energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical products and telecommunications. Besides United States, APEC, which accounts half all global trade  consists these members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. During Malaysia meeting, APEC also will include three new members: Russia  one latest victims financial crisis  Vietnam and Peru. The agenda might be global, menu will be Malaysian when world leaders meet next week Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Pacific Rim leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample local dishes luncheon planned end their two-day summit. It's expected be hot affair. Spicy delicacies menu are satay kajang, beef or chicken kebab peanut sauce; ayam percik, chicken curry chilies; soto ayam, Malaysian chicken soup, and fried rice village-style, Star newspaper reported Monday editions. Desert will be simple: fresh tropical fruit, said Maleia Marsden, general manager Cyberview Lodge, where leaders were expected stay summit Nov. 17-18.

He spoke interview Monte Carlo Radio, Arabic station broadcasting Paris that is widely listened Middle East. A leaflet signed group and faxed Reuters Jerusalem said heroic attack, which 24 people were injured and 2 bombers killed, had been carried out confront great conspiracy that aims liquidate Palestinian cause Oslo and Wye Plantation agreements submission. Islamic Holy War and its counterpart, Hamas, have denounced sellout Palestinian rights 1993 Oslo self-rule accord and latest agreement, known Wye Memorandum, named Wye Plantation Maryland, where deal was worked out strenuous American mediation. Shallah's claim responsibility abroad contrasted muted response Islamic Holy War's leadership Gaza Strip, which has reportedly given commitments Palestinian Authority refrain such attacks. We have no knowledge movement operation that occurred Jerusalem, said Nafez Azzam, senior leader Islamic Holy War Gaza. From its conditions we consider it likely that it was individual effort. The Palestinian cabinet, statement issued meeting Friday night, accused foreign forces standing attack. One cabinet member, who declined be identified, pointed finger Iran, saying search one bomber's home had uncovered letter he had written Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, expressing condolences recent killing several Iranian diplomats Afghanistan.

Itaf Alayan, supporter group who runs Islamic Purity Nursery Bethlehem, said Palestinian officers had raided school and confiscated videotapes and educational cassettes locking it up. The two bombers were identified Youssef Zughayer, 21, Anata, Jerusalem, and his brother-in-law, Suleiman Tahayneh, 24, Silat al-Harithiya, West Bank town Jenin. Both had served time Israeli jails and were known be members Islamic Holy War. We never thought he would do something this, said Muhammad Zughayer, Youssef's father. We condemn such acts, only thing we can do now is say may he rest peace. On warm, sunny morning last Friday, time he left work his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer said goodbye his grandmother last time and rode his death. Relatives say that 21-year-old Palestinian this village Jerusalem showed no sign that he was heading suicide mission his brother-in-law part secret cell Islamic Holy War. Their car-bomb blew apart two hours later Jerusalem market, killing men and wounding 24 people. Don't grieve me, he wrote farewell note, according relatives who found it later. If you cry, cry happiness that I'm martyr. Don't serve bitter coffee, serve sweets. I'm going Paradise. At family's stone house Jerusalem Sunday, visitors paying condolence calls were served sweet juice, not coffee, Sughayer's relatives tried make sense what he had done. The young man, once ace student, had come age Israeli prisons. Jailed year age 15 stoning Israeli cars riots Palestinian uprising, he was imprisoned again 17, that time three-and-a-half years similar offenses and affiliation Islamic Holy War. Relatives said he was impressionable teen-ager, influenced Islamic militants whom he was jailed. Sughayer came out prison more devout, and hardened mistreatment hands Israelis, relatives said. His cellmates taught him doctrine holy war and glories martyrdom, said older brother, Samih Sughayer. They sowed it his heart, he said. He wanted be martyr cause God. But that reality, suddenly so clear Sunday, was not so apparent when Sughayer was freed seven months ago. He seemed normal, said his brother. He went work grocery store, he finished his high school classes and he wanted enroll university. He was supposed take driving test few days. If he was planning something, we didn't see it. He would stay late night work, studying Koran and praying, he showed no outward signs rage Israel. He would joke things and say that happens is God's will, said brother-in-law, who insisted anonymity. He was easygoing guy. Last Thursday, Sughayer bought battered red Fiat and parked it his house. When someone home asked car he said nothing, and family members assumed it was one stolen vehicles found here. On Friday morning he left car, meeting his brother-in-law and old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who came his village West Bank town Jenin. Tahayneh had his score settle Israelis. His leg had been amputated he was shot confrontation Israeli troops uprising, his relatives said. The Fiat was loaded explosives, and two men drove market. That evening, when concerned members Sughayer family gathered await news their missing relative, man arrived and told them that he had sold his car Youssef previous day. It was red Fiat, same car they had seen house, and same type car that news reports said had exploded marketplace. At midnight, Israeli security forces raided house and interrogated family members. The last, grim pieces puzzle fell place. Up last minute Thursday night we were talking together, said Sughayer's oldest brother, Ali, who worked him midnight produce store. He asked me someone who had moved his hardware shop another village, how he was doing. Earlier we ate together, and we talked giving charity poor. He wasn't nervous. He had plans future, Ali continued. Maybe people his group convinced him do this, and he could not refuse. We not expect this him. A car rigged explosives blew Friday morning Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed Israelis shopping Jewish Sabbath, killing two people and wounding 21. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has tried stop peace agreement, claimed responsibility, police said. In response attack, Israeli cabinet suspended ratification Wye agreement there is verification that Palestinian authority is indeed fighting terrorism. The Israeli Cabinet also announced it will begin build houses controversial Jewish settlement Har Homa east Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had held work recent months apparent attempt not disrupt negotiations Palestinians. Aides Netanyahu were not immediately available comment. The Cabinet ministers had just begun second day of talks peace agreement mile (kilometer) away entrance market and just meters (yards) site suicide bombing last year. In Friday's explosion, rigged car, red Fiat, blew 9:45 a.m. (0745 GMT) entrance Mahane Yehuda market, just meters (yards) away site suicide bombing July 1997. Witnesses heard series small explosions. Yair Cohen, 43, said he was buying cookies when he saw car driving slowly, smoke coming out hood and exhaust pipes. People started shout `car fire.' After while, we heard blast, and something hit me stomach, said Cohen who was treated minor injuries Hadassah Hospital. The car was mass twisted metal sitting middle main intersection market. Flames shot 100 feet (30 meters) air. A charred corpse, covered blanket, lay several meters away. Streams soot-black water ran street. Another bare-legged body lay street, face down, pool blood head. Rescue workers covered body sodden pieces cardboard box and plastic shopping bags. There was hysteria, people were running, said Eliad Duan, Israeli border policeman who was patrolling market and was lightly injured. One heavy-set woman, apparently shock, climbed ambulance, weeping. Three paramedics talked her, persuading her that she not need medical treatment, and few moments she climbed out vehicle again. Soldiers and police wearing plastic gloves held back crowds. It's dangerous  stay back! they shouted. Just block away blast, shoppers went their business. One young woman shopper said: We can't stop what we are doing when this happens. Hassan Asfour, Palestinian peace negotiator, said Palestinian Authority condemned attack. This is crime and whoever commits this, hurts interests Palestinian people. The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday suicide bombing crowded Jerusalem market and promised more attacks try block new peace accord. This heroic operation is not first and not going be last, group said leaflet faxed news organizations. We refuse any political agreement that would recognize Zionist enemy. The leaflet could not immediately be authenticated, its style was consistent that communications group. An Islamic Jihad official Syrian capital Damascus confirmed that group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility Friday's bombing interview Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo. Palestinian security sources and families dead bombers had already identified them Islamic Jihad activists. At least half dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded bombing, sources said. Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility anonymous phone calls police, all sides now have agreed that it was Islamic Jihad that carried it out. There was no immediate explanation inaccurate claim, two groups have carried out attacks together part their goal stopping peace process. Setting stage new quarrel how crack militants, Israel is demanding that military wings two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them. Implementation Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord, signed Oct. 23 Washington, was have begun this week, has hit various snags. Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put vote ratify accord suicide bombing Friday Jerusalem that killed two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility. David Bar-Illan, top aide Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat formally outlaw military wings Islamic Jihad and larger militant group Hamas. Hassan Asfour, senior Palestinian official, said Hamas' military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and military wing Islamic Jihad were outlawed Palestinian Authority 1996. But Bar-Illan said Palestinian legislature had never passed such law. Why Mr. Arafat agree Wye accord outlaw them if he has already done it? he asked. The Wye memorandum states that Palestinian Authority will inform United States fully actions it has taken outlaw all organizations (or wings organizations, appropriate) military, terrorist or violent character, and their support structure and prevent them freedom action areas its jurisdiction. A Palestinian security official, speaking condition anonymity, said joint Israeli-Palestinian meeting was held Saturday night discuss security wake Friday's attack. Participants included head Palestinian intelligence, Amin Hindi, and head preventive security Gaza Strip, Mohammed Dahlan. The idea outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was brought meeting and also proposed Netanyahu Arafat phone call, official said. The Palestinians said they could ban activity Hamas or Islamic Jihad that endangered either Israelis or Palestinians, could not outlaw them outright political movements. Friday's bombing led finger-pointing sides. Israel said it showed Arafat's crackdown terrorists had not been sweeping enough. The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel failing take least partial security responsibility attack, because attackers came Israeli-controlled areas, and had recently served time Israeli jails. Israel rule is harshly critical Palestinian Authority's security efforts when attackers come Palestinian-controlled areas or have been released Palestinian prisons. On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu-Medein accused Netanyahu using blast pretext delaying implementation peace accord. This attack is gift Mr. Netanyahu, Abu-Medein said. All time he is praying God help him ... escape agreement. Under accord, Israel is hand another 13 percent territory West Bank Palestinians exchange various security steps. Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predicted Sunday that Israeli Cabinet would ratify agreement coming days. I estimate that government will meet this week and will accept decision majority (in favor agreement), he said.

But because large number candidates deputy's job ruling United Malays National Organization, decision was not expected quickly. The party leaders, who have been conducting national campaign explain Malaysians why popular Anwar was fired Sept. 2, will also confer what do now that High Court judge has banned all comments Anwar's guilt or innocence. The ruling coalition had scheduled giant rally capital Saturday, aimed drawing youth whom Anwar's campaign reform has most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery 1989, had groomed Anwar, 51, his successor. But he fired his protege his posts deputy prime minister and finance minister grounds he was morally unfit lead. The two had differed economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was threat his 17-year rule.

They decided that government should be brought demonstrations, riots, Bernama news agency quoted Mahathir saying Sarawak state Borneo Island.

After Anwar appeared court black eye, bruised face, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly presidents Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised possibility they might not attend 18-nation summit Malaysia next month.

Deprived voice state-controlled newspapers and television, supporters Malaysia's jailed opposition leader have turned Internet air their views. Although government said police would check every bit information and leaflet posted Internet, Malaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledged Friday medium is impossible control. Jailed, beaten and facing trial 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is political underdog Malaysia. In realm cyberspace, though, he's top dog. Within hours Anwar's recent speech accusing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cruelty and insanity, dozens boot-legged recordings had been posted new websites hatched supporters. Among hottest images now making Internet rounds are several news-photo versions Anwar's badly bruised eye, which he claims was inflicted police his first night detention. Most pro-Anwar sites also contain his speeches, private letters Mahathir, clippings foreign news reports and prose scorching 72-year old prime minister. Most Internet content Anwar is false or unverifiable, medium is tough rein in, said Azzman Shariffadeen, head Mimos, company that set Malaysia's Internet infrastructure. No website has been blocked or censored government, he said. Shortly Anwar's arrest, one former leader's aides bragged that they had set dozens sites offshore, reach Malaysian government. Malaysian journalist M.G.G. Pillai, who runs popular website local politics, isn't surprised aggressive march cyberspace. When you're opposition and you have no access resources and media, then you end making use what's available air your grouses, he said, noting that membership his site has soared 40 percent Anwar's ouster. The cyber explosion is boon most middle-class Malaysians, who are leery local media. I've finally given reading local newspapers. They're so skewed, said Michael Chan, lawyer who upgraded his computer high-speed modem day Anwar was arrested Sept. 20. Chan uses modem download pictures balaclava-clad police bulletproof jackets busting Anwar's front door bundling him jail. Occasionally, he receives e-mail calling organized rallies National Mosque and nearby Independence Square, where hundreds protesters have been arrested police. The advertised demonstrations don't always materialize. Other e-mails call silent protests.

Aness, Pakistani permanent residence United States, was sentenced six months jail. In move that could deal major setback case Anwar, Aness then filed letter appeal his lawyers. Another letter then appeared, saying Aness would not go appeal. His lawyers say second letter was fraud. His instructions are he wants us proceed appeal. There is no change, said Balwant Singh, one two lawyers defending Aness, meeting Aness. One major charges Anwar hinges Aness' confession. Singh spoke reporters attending court proceedings Monday where Anwar's trial was fixed Nov. 2 corruption charges. He said he went hospital meet Aness when court broke lunch. Aness was jailed Sept. 15 moved soon hospital where he has been treatment heart problems. He has given us written retainer. He signed notice appeal. We have instructions proceed and we are proceeding, said Singh, adding he filed letter appeal court Sept. 29. Between visits his client, however, Aness signed another letter saying he would not proceed appeal, Singh said. That led confusion whether Aness really wanted appeal. Somebody approached him and asked him sign typewritten letter, said Singh. He was asked sign it and he did. Bruises face jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed newspaper front pages two days and downloaded Internet, are blemishing image Malaysian police. After first suggesting that former deputy prime minister had beaten himself face, neck and arms 10 days police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called investigation wounds Anwar displayed court Tuesday and Wednesday. We can't accept this and we will undertake full investigations, Mahathir was quoted saying Thursday's New Straits Times. The police cannot harm their detainees course their interrogation. Mahathir fired Anwar Sept. 2 his posts deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit office. The two had differed economic policy country veered recession and Anwar has said 72-year-old Mahathir feared him alternative leader. Local newspapers that are normally pro-Mahathir have splashed close-up photos Anwar's badly bruised face two days. People are peering pictures, downloading copies Internet, discussing whether Mahathir, who also oversees police home affairs minister, knew what was happening man he had once groomed his successor. It was not first time that Malaysian has said he was tortured or mistreated police custody. But there has been no one high-profile Anwar. What I experienced was chicken feed compared Anwar, Syed Husin Ali, head opposition Malaysian People's Party, said Thursday. In book his six-month detention same law that kept Anwar away family and lawyers 10 days, Syed described being hit and deprived sleep. At least I didn't have bruises my face, although I was slapped and hit stomach, Syed told The Associated Press. Anwar's bruises raise alarming questions state governance country, said Lim Kit Siang, leader opposition Democratic Action Party. If Mahathir not know alleged beatings, it suggests police acted their own. At series rallies his arrest, Anwar led throngs chanting Mahathir's resignation and more open, less corrupt government. His arrest Sept. 20 was followed street protests and hundreds additional arrests. Before his arrest, Anwar designated his wife, Azizah Ismail, leader his new reform movement. But police have banned her speaking publicly. On Thursday she was summoned third time police headquarters questioning interview regional television network CNBC Asia. She had expressed fears that her husband would be injected HIV virus prove allegations homosexuality, and police are investigating possible charges sedition her. She called repeated interviews pressure and harassment. Three Malaysian police officers traveled Singapore Thursday ask CNBC news anchors how they had arranged get Sept. 21 interview Azizah and one Anwar Sept. 3. CNBC refused answer questions its news gathering, said vice president news programming Chris Blackman. Anwar, who pleaded innocent this week five charges sodomy and five corruption, told court that police beat him night he was arrested, blood seeped my nose, leaving him half-conscious. His allegations, accompanied pictorial evidence, brought prompt expressions disapproval, U.S. State Department, Australian government, Amnesty International, and finance ministers other countries who used meet Anwar international conferences. On Thursday, Indonesian government, where security forces have been accused years mistreating prisoners, said it regretted reports Anwar's injuries and that allegations have placed doubt visit Malaysia President B.J. Habibie. The arrest former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday. Anwar was fired Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Sept. 2 two differed economic policy. He then began speaking out Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. Frankly speaking there is no reason say that just because one man was arrested something ... that it should bring any unrest, trade minister Rafidah Aziz said. Leaders come and go. ... They get sacked all countries world. They die, she told news conference Manila, where she attended meeting Association Southeast Asian Nations economic ministers. Rafidah said there have only been few demonstrations Malaysia Anwar's arrest, all them orchestrated. In recent visits Chicago, New York, Houston and Boston, she said potential investors asked her Anwar's arrest were still interested investing Malaysia. Anwar said police beat him custody. In recent appearances court, where he is facing charges corruption and illegal homosexual acts, he was seen black eye and neck brace. At least two ASEAN leaders, Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, have spoken out Anwar's treatment. The Philippine leader said he was skipping summit Asia-Pacific leaders Malaysia November protest arrest Anwar, whom he described personal friend. He later said he would attend summit and had only made earlier remarks out sympathy Anwar. The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia are founding member countries ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was notable man bold vision: physical and social transformation that would push this nation forefront world affairs. It almost came true. In 17 years prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who is medical doctor, fostered economic liberalization that led some world's fastest rates growth. He drove Malaysians be more productive, embrace high technology and begin major investments world. He created national affirmative-action program that allowed country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians share improved living standards and new sense Malaysian identity and pride. This year was have been Mahathir's year triumph, perhaps paving way his retirement, inauguration huge public works projects and impressive gatherings foreign leaders and sportsmen. But today, dizzying turnaround, Malaysia is Asia's critical list, its economy teetering edge disaster and its stability shaken what seems have been entirely avoidable political cat fight. Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him corruption and illegal sex acts. The move set street demonstrations and aroused international condemnation, particularly Anwar's many friends foreign governments. One region's most stable and prosperous nations is suddenly uproar. It appears that Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, pressures economic collapse have spawned political crisis. In all those nations, result was change leadership. The question now is: Is Mahathir next? The answer is far clear. Unlike Indonesia, there has been little evidence simmering discontent Malaysia. The ouster former President Suharto Indonesia had been predicted many people. Almost no one seems have foreseen eruption here. Malaysia is not familiar political demonstrations. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. Many people here were puzzled and disturbed when they encountered water cannon and riot police streets recent weeks. What we're seeing is unprecedented, said Ambassador John Malott United States. This has never happened Malaysia, and nobody knows where it's going go. You can write lot scenarios we are totally uncharted waters. Mahathir, confident nation-builder, seems be flailing he watches his legacy crumble. An economy that had been growing more 8 percent year last decade is now headed contraction perhaps 6 percent. Angry and frustrated, he closed Malaysia international financial markets one month ago, turning his back foreign investors whom he once embraced and who had fueled country's rapid growth. The move had intended effect bringing home Malaysian currency, insulating it speculators Mahathir blames crisis, and giving adrenaline jolt now self-contained economy. It is move that seems tune recent questioning economic orthodoxy International Monetary Fund. But few foreign economists expect it work long. Mahathir is attacking fundamental beliefs free market, capitalism, Wall Street, foreign diplomat said. We are either watching economic theory being rewritten or reconfirmed  and I don't think it's being rewritten. The day making his economic gamble, Mahathir set most severe political crisis his tenure, dismissing Anwar, man he had been grooming be his successor. Two weeks later, Anwar was arrested his home and held incommunicado 10 days, which he says he was beaten his jailers. Last week he was charged 10 counts corruption and sexual misconduct that could result prison term 34 years. The harshness those moves unleashed surge largely unsuspected discontent that mobilized Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals and politically assertive Muslims. For first time decades, Malaysians thousands demonstrated streets and mosques and were met tear gas and water cannon. Many people were beaten and hundreds were detained, although most were later released. With emergence this still-tentative opposition movement, fear expressed one Western diplomat is downward spiral which suppression breeds more discontent breeds more suppression breeds more discontent. People here whisper that Mahathir's days may now be numbered. But few venture guess what number might be. Given his control levers power and lack focus or leadership opposition, Mahathir could ride out storm Anwar's trial proceeds. But he has struck harsh blow morale his nation, sense confidence he had worked so hard build slogan Malaysia Can! In this generally decorous nation, depth anger expressed two men who once called each other father and son is disturbing hear. Anwar, says prime minister, is despicable and sodomist. Mahathir, says his former deputy, is senile and insane. Malaysians, who have stolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian rule mixture gratitude and emerging pride, seem stunned. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy who will be his successor. The man need not necessarily be very religious and only preoccupied doing virtuous deeds all times, national news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir saying Friday prayers Al-Falah Mosque northern town Jitra Kedah state. It is sufficient that person does things acceptable people, Mahathir said. So far Mahathir, 72, has designated three heirs-apparent his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenged Mahathir leadership ruling party, and lost. On Sept. 2, he fired last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him morally unfit office. Anwar mounted nationwide campaign prime minister being detained national security risk and charged illegal homosexual acts and corruption connection those allegations. Mahathir told reporters later that Anwar had been working toppling him prime minister and president governing coalition's dominant party, United Malays National Organization. He appeared very good me he was actually planning ways bringing me down. At first, I not believe when people told me this, I now know this be true, said Mahathir. Mahathir said Anwar had arranged his supporters contest and gain control UMNO divisions so that he could win party's top post next year's party elections. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie finds attending summit Asia-Pacific leaders difficult because his concerns arrest Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Thai newspaper reported Sunday. Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled meet next month Malaysia annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he was not going Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. I'm very concerned how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been treated, Habibie was quoted saying English-language newspaper The Nation. I'm concerned because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed lot benefit his country. Anwar is charismatic politician who was once picked be successor Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he was suddenly fired Mahathir Sept. 2 two differed economic policy. He then began speaking out Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. Anwar has been accused engaging homosexual acts illegal Malaysia law, charges are generally seen pretext his political persecution. In court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised and he said he had been beaten police, heightening international attention his case. Because human rights involved  and I think it is universal  people should be given chance defend themselves, Habibie was quoted saying interview conducted Saturday. People should not be tortured. Habibie said Anwar's dismissal should not have been based things which had not been proven. On attending APEC meeting, he said, It's difficult me. But he said he would consult parliament, adding, I'm not coming personally president 211 million people Indonesia. Like Estrada, Habibie served his country's vice president when Anwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts international affairs circuit. Lawyers prime minister's former deputy, now his most prominent opponent, went court Thursday demand their client's release indefinite detention. Azizah Ismail, wife jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, told reporters that lawyers had filed habeas corpus appeal that says dissident politician is being unjustly held. She said authorities have denied lawyers access her husband, and asked: How are they going prepare his defense? Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20 Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention trial, two weeks rallies Malaysia which he called government reform and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation. Anwar was sacked Sept. 2 his posts deputy prime minister and finance minister, he had differed Mahathir policy escaping economic recession. But prime minister said deputy was fired because he was morally unfit. Anwar said Mahathir viewed him threat. Anwar has been charged corruption and illegal homosexual acts, and is go trial Nov. 2. He has pleaded innocent all charges, which he says were trumped his political enemies. We claim that his detention is illegal and we'll prove that court, said one Anwar's lawyers, Pawancheek Marican. He said lawyers had asked High Court early hearing request Anwar's release. When Anwar appeared court Monday, judge had assured defense attorneys that they would have access their client so that they could prepare their arguments trial. Azizah said authorities have spurned all her requests family members visit her husband grounds that Anwar's case was still police investigation. I pleaded police allow children see their father, she told reporters courthouse. I told them that I don't have see my husband. But please let my son go and see him. But police said no. Although Anwar remains custody Bukit Aman federal police headquarters Kuala Lumpur, all five those arrested ISA participating activities and rallies organized Anwar have been released. Sidek Baba, deputy rector International Islamic University, was released Wednesday 16 days jail. I may have been detained because I knew Anwar my involvement Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement, Sidek was quoted saying The Star daily. Despite recent protests him, Prime Minister Mahathir said Wednesday that support his ruling party remains strong and there have been no defections party, which claims membership 2.4 million nation 22 million. He ruled out early election prove his popularity. A general election is not scheduled 2000. Support is solid, said Mahathir. There is no exodus party.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)  U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday military situation Kosovo was bad now two weeks ago. Holbrooke said he will explain extreme gravity situation when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday. Speaking meeting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said while level fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, capacity its resumption is there. The situation therefore remains fully serious today it was week or two ago, he told reporters flying Belgrade. He plans meet Kosovan Albanian leaders Tuesday. We hope make clear president Milosevic and people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation, he said. Under NATO threat end his punishing offensive ethnic Albanian separatists Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia has ordered most units his army back their barracks and may well avoid attack alliance, military observers and diplomats say. Milosevic, who one hand is excoriated Washington scourge Kosovo other hand is treated key peace Bosnia, acted European Union, NATO and United Nations prepared review Monday possible military intervention. Russia stepped its warnings such action and dispatched its foreign and defense ministers unusually high-level mission see Yugoslav president Sunday Belgrade. As he has so often, Milosevic appears have bowed foreign demands nick time and still accomplished what he wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observers Kosovo reported that military stand-down had taken place province, where Milosevic's forces have waged fierce offensive Albanian rebels. The observers said that segments three brigades, most units Yugoslav army were home. The daily reports observer mission, made U.S., European Union and Russian military experts, are one key elements helping Washington and European capitals decide whether Milosevic has met their demands cease-fire. By putting army back its barracks, sending some police units out Kosovo and ordering end burning and looting villages, Milosevic may well avoid NATO attack, diplomats here and Washington said. But same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked other way, he enjoyed three-month license overwhelm Kosovo Liberation Army  rebel army fighting independence Kosovo and its ethnic Albanian majority  and terrorize rural civilian population that supports it. His military operation created more 250,000 refugees, whom Clinton administration is gearing take care this winter variety relief organizations. U.S. officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy who dealt Milosevic negotiating end war Bosnia, meet him Monday discuss political plan Kosovo. The heart disagreement Kosovo is Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, which insists keeping Kosovo province, and ethnic Albanians there who have chafed Milosevic's repression he stripped province virtual autonomy 1989, and who now seek independence. The West, fearing precedent that independence Kosovo would set other conflicts world, has been trying mediate middle course. In essence, diplomats said they believed that plan Holbrooke will present Milosevic calls three-year interim period leading status fairly close pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since Kosovo conflict flared March, critics Washington's policy Milosevic argue that he has been able choreograph every move suit his goal: pushing Albanian population submission impunity. The United States and its allies have waited four months while he cleaned clock Kosovo Liberation Army, said Morton Abramowitz, head International Crisis Group, policy analysis organization, and taken three weeks discuss military action, result that 500 Albanian villages were destroyed. Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed live its earlier threat June strike Serbia, Milosevic took advantage indecision and plunged ahead artillery and tank offensive lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose bedrock popular support had helped win them effective control large swaths Kosovo territory, including key roads. While he was doing that, Milosevic skillfully managed key requirement Washington: he made sure that war not spill neighboring Albania and Macedonia, fragile countries traditionally volatile area. All along, biggest fear Washington has been that Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania and ethnic Albanian population Macedonia join cause. Such possibility raised specter new Balkans conflict just three years peace was secured Bosnia. Milosevic catered Washington's concern that conflict be contained. The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's borders Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting routes arms supplies rebels. The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington was unsure how deal disorganized Albanian political leadership Kosovo and unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chiefs were hardened emigres returned Switzerland and Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic meet May Ibrahim Rugova, top Albanian political leader Kosovo, encounter that turned out be little more photo opportunity. For that procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended lifting ban foreign investment Serbia that had been put place month before. After meeting Rugova, Milosevic stepped his military operations Kosovo, forcing Washington reverse itself again and carry out investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders province's western town Junik then broke all contact. Clinton administration officials said time that they were concerned that NATO intervention would bolster separatist forces. To try put best face situation, Washington worked Moscow get Milosevic accept presence international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and report military action. The monitors were slow getting organized. By August, when Yugoslav army, backed Serbian special police, were full swing rebels and burning and looting villages process, monitors found it difficult gain access fighting. They drove roadblocks, knew something was going sounds and smoke, could not be precise. In recent days tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access has improved, monitors say. But there are some areas central Kosovo Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that monitors have ruled limits because land mines roads. The mines are believed have been planted guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje was site massacre 18 ethnic Albanian women, children and elderly people Sept. 26. A British reporter who walked fields village Sunday said 10 mortar shells, apparently Serbian police or Yugoslav army, were fired village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible vast majority atrocities Kosovo conflict, said report New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here Sunday. The report said rebels had also violated laws war taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions. But violations guerrillas were lesser scale government abuses, author report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused what it called watershed conflict  attack police forces three ethnic Albanian villages late February and early March Drenica region central Kosovo. At least 83 people, including 24 women and children, were killed attack, which involved helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers. In Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is four-hour drive north rolling countryside Kosovo's capital Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure. That is part, his domestic critics say, because diplomats Holbrooke and head U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist going see him, thus enhancing his stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia Monday night and according American diplomats told him that he had take further steps pull back his military Kosovo Province or face NATO attack. Milosevic was also told, diplomats said, that he had insure that roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have been forced flee their homes fighting last six months be allowed return home. Most these refugees are reluctant return because many Serb police officers who destroyed their homes and villages remain neighborhoods. After delivering his sternest message so far Milosevic Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said news conference that NATO's military plans attacking Serbia were moving ahead serious, intense and sustained basis. Holbrooke's mission Milosevic was described American diplomats not do or die trip, they added, We're very serious juncture. Shortly Holbrooke's meeting Milosevic, Yugoslav leader issued defiant statement Serbian television which he said threats aggression outlined Holbrooke represented criminal act. Milosevic, who rarely comments his meetings foreign diplomats and whose tough words cast unusually ominous tone, also said that Holbrooke's position constituted support Albanian terrorists and not Albanian people. Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke supporting ethnic Albanian guerrillas Kosovo Liberation Army, who have been fighting make Serbian province Kosovo independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added that more seven days there have been no skirmishes or military action. An American diplomat familiar themes Holbrooke planned stress Milosevic said there had been no expectation that American envoy would walk out Monday night agreement. Rather, point was underscore Yugoslav leader and make explicit what was expected him. It was not quite ultimatum, diplomat said, more matter what steps have be taken show compliance. The essence Holbrooke's demands centered issues outlined United Nations Security Council resolution two weeks ago. The resolution ordered Milosevic withdraw extra army and police forces that were sent Kosovo deal guerrillas and send back their bases military forces normally stationed province. So far, American diplomats said, Milosevic has withdrawn troops field not all them are their barracks. Such move is essential, American diplomats said, create conducive atmosphere any possible negotiations future status province. The U.N. resolution also calls political solution. Holbrooke and U.S. ambassador Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discussed Milosevic political document drawn State Department that calls broad autonomy Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew autonomy 1989 he began his campaign Serb nationalism. The countryside central Kosovo has been eerily silent last Thursday. The sound artillery thuds and mortar rounds have been noticeably absent and coils white smoke that signified burning villages have vanished green hills and valleys. Police checkpoints are more relaxed and areas that were sealed this time last week Yugoslav army are now open patrols diplomatic monitors United States, European Union and Russia. These monitors, many whom are former military officers, have reported that Yugoslav army has stood and that they have seen virtually no military action late last week. There has been sporadic shooting, monitors have reported. But this superficial calm is not good enough because Serb military has capacity resume fighting very quickly, NATO military officer said Monday. The officer added that cease-fire Kosovo is pretty much enacted. He also said that trend compliance is positive. The interior ministry police must also reduce their presence villages so that refugees who have fled have confidence return, military officer said. Some interior ministry police officers had left province, not enough, he added. On question how badly damaged KLA had been Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, NATO officer said, It's fair assessment that KLA is dismantled not destroyed. Holbrooke's first stop Monday was Brussels, where he met secretary-general NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday he plans travel Pristina, capital Kosovo, where he is scheduled meet ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova present political proposal future status Kosovo. He is expected back Belgrade Tuesday afternoon another session Milosevic. The United States and Russia are ratcheting pressure President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action soon end humanitarian crisis southern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put nation's air defense high alert, tried belated compromise moving some tanks and other heavy equipment out Kosovo. A Western diplomat said 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday that situation Kosovo is bad now two weeks ago. Holbrooke is en route Belgrade meeting Milosevic. While level fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, capacity its resumption is there, Holbrooke said meeting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K.

On Sunday, Milosevic met Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. The Russians are using NATO force Kosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said airstrikes could occur if decisive measures are not immediately taken radical improvement situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such attack, Yugoslavia must end hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures overcome humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part peace talks, he said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that NATO action could come days. NATO's decision may depend report U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled present Security Council Monday whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands. Serb authorities appeared ready compromise installing interim government rebellious province Serbia, dominant republic Yugoslavia. Serbian police and Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels crackdown that began late February. The conflict has killed hundreds  most them Albanian civilians  and left more 275,000 refugees. A Yugoslav statement said nation's leaders wanted Kosovo dispute solved peacefully, case we are attacked, we shall defend our country all means. The government said Friday that fighting had ended and blamed continuing violence ethnic Albanian rebels, who are fighting independence Serbian province. Although United States and Europeans want end fighting, they also oppose independence majority Albanian province, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan countries Albanian populations. In Kosovo capital Pristina, KLA offered help NATO forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said statement published Monday Albanian language newspaper Bujku that we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality and we shall provide assistance... if it is asked us. Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians having given independence and having become servants enemy, agreeing accept autonomy not independence. Serbs reported two attacks Sunday civilian cars Albanian terrorists 25 miles (40 kilometers) south Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital. Elsewhere, policeman was killed stepping mine, Serb Media Center said. The Kosovo Information Center, allied ethnic Albanians, reported heavy fighting government forces and guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest Pristina. Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected new interim government, which was drawn their participation. The council is composed seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and rest Turks and Muslims. Momentum involvement has increased week revelations massacres ethnic Albanian civilians forests Kosovo. London's Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain is preparing troops and armored units Kosovo, be deployed post-airstrike peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused confirm or deny report repeated that Britain was ready participate NATO attack. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night his British counterpart, Robin Cook, discuss situation Kosovo, France's Foreign Ministry said. Vedrine and Secretary State Madeleine Albright had lengthy telephone conversation well, spokesman said. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said Milosevic's government and ethnic Albanian rebels have committed atrocities conflict began, government abuses were much greater scale. The report New York-based human rights organization says Milosevic has primary responsibility gross government abuses. With threat NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday nation faces immiment danger war and claimed government was taking steps comply international demands peace Kosovo. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said systematic terror had been inflicted Kosovo civilians recent days and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible. But Annan said he not have means necessary provide independent assessment compliance required Security Council and suggested 15 members may want make their judgement this respect. But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said situation southern Serbian province was bad now two weeks ago. Holbrooke spoke Brussels, Belgium en route Belgrade, where he planned drive home Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic extreme gravity situation. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told emergency session parliament Monday that country is faced imminent danger war. Kosovo is province Serbia, main republic Yugoslavia. The threats are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call this parliament conclude that Yugoslavia is faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia has defend itself if it was attacked. One option could be parliament declare state emergency  step which could lead general mobilization all military-aged men. In attempt head NATO action, Bulatovic said government had accepted Russian proposal Organization Security and Cooperation Europe investigate crisis. Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such mission Kosovo Yugoslav membership 54-nation organization is restored. Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five 10 special police units had been removed Kosovo and had been returned barracks province. In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would not be enough satisfy Washington and prevent NATO attack. While level fighting may have abated temporarily, capacity its resumption is there, Holbrooke said meeting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation, therefore, remains fully serious today it was week or two ago, he said. We hope make clear president Milosevic and people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation. Meanwhile, head Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, called Milosevic accept all international demands and avert NATO attack. We have avert clash whole world, confrontation which we are bound lose, Montenegro's pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said statement. Djukanovic, staunch Milosevic critic, called Yugoslav president address nation unambiguous message that he has accepted all U.N. resolutions and agreements he made Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problems Milosevic's undemocratic regime. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put nation's air defense high alert and moved some tanks and other heavy equipment out Kosovo. A Western diplomat said 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out. Belgrade had been counting Russia block any U.N.-sanctioned military moves Western Alliance. On Sunday, Milosevic met Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. Although Russians are using NATO force Kosovo, Ivanov and Sergeyev said airstrikes could occur if decisive measures are not immediately taken radical improvement situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told ITAR-Tass news agency.

Serb authorities appeared ready compromise installing interim government rebellious province Serbia, dominant republic Yugoslavia. Serbian police and Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels crackdown that began late February. The conflict has killed hundreds  most them Albanian civilians  and left more 275,000 refugees. Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent province's 2 million-strong population, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule. Momentum involvement has increased week revelations massacres ethnic Albanian civilians forests Kosovo. Although United States and Europeans want end fighting, they also oppose independence Kosovo, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan countries Albanian populations. In Kosovo capital Pristina, KLA offered help NATO forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said statement published Monday Albanian language newspaper Bujku that we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality and we shall provide assistance... if it is asked us. Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians having given independence and having become servants enemy, agreeing accept autonomy not independence. Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected new interim government, which was drawn their participation. The council is composed seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and rest Turks and Muslims. With NATO attacks said be only days away, top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered last-minute warning Monday Yugoslavia's president halt his crackdown ethnic Albanians Kosovo or face airstrikes. But Slobodan Milosevic showed no signs backing down. Following his meeting Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued statement denouncing NATO threats criminal act that favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas. The statement, broadcast government television, said there had been no fighting Serbian province seven days and that crisis represented no threat other countries southern Balkans. Holbrooke, U.S. ambassador-designate United Nations, met Milosevic several hours late Monday arriving Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred senior NATO officials. Holbrooke issued no statement meeting. Before boarding plane Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said conditions southern Serbian province had not improved alliance started two weeks ago finalize plans air raids force Milosevic halt his offensive Kosovo Albanian separatists. Holbrooke said he planned drive home Milosevic extreme gravity situation. Holbrooke negotiated peace deal Milosevic and other Balkan leaders that ended 3 1/2 year Bosnian war 1995. In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern that Milosevic was playing classic game making false promises avoid NATO military strikes. Clinton, telephone call Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance U.N. demands must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible, press secretary Joe Lockhart said White House. What happens next depends President Milosevic, Lockhart quoted president telling Russian leader, who has opposed use force Moscow's longtime ally. As Holbrooke tried resolve crisis negotiations, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said decision NATO military action was imminent. We are getting ready NATO action and later this week we will expect decision be taken, Cook told reporters special session Cabinet called Prime Minister Tony Blair. In Brussels, NATO officials said they were ready launch airstrikes hours receiving order attack. If that first airstrike failed deter Serb forces, senior NATO official said condition anonymity, alliance could unleash fully fledged air campaign involving hundreds planes. At United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav forces had increased their attacks Kosovo's ethnic Albanians U.N. resolution demanded cease-fire. In widely anticipated report Security Council, Annan listed apparent violations Sept. 23 U.N. resolution, decried appalling atrocities Kosovo, and said it was clear any reasonable doubt that Yugoslav forces were responsible bulk them. The U.N. chief also said rebel forces Kosovo Liberation Army also were responsible human rights violations, charge KLA quickly denied. NATO countries had been awaiting U.N. chief's report determine whether use military force stop offensive ethnic Albanians, who are seeking autonomy they had 1989, if not independence, Yugoslavia. Albanians province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness declare Serb noncompliance, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Clinton administration believed Milosevic had not met conditions laid U.N. Security Council. Foley cited absence formal cease-fire, failure arrange meaningful dialogue ethnic Albanian leaders and continued presence major army units southeastern Kosovo Albania's border. The European Union nations were divided Monday whether launch air strikes U.N. Security Council backing. The EU foreign ministers, meeting Luxembourg, agreed tighten economic sanctions Milosevic, it was unlikely that stricter travel curbs Yugoslav officials and freezing more Yugoslav assets abroad would be anything more symbolic. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told emergency session parliament Monday that country is faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia is comprised dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro. The threats are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call this parliament conclude that Yugoslavia is faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia has defend itself if it was attacked. One option was parliament declare state emergency  step mobilization all military-aged men. But parliament voted introduce measure when first bomb drops our territory. In attempt head NATO action, Bulatovic said government had accepted Russian proposal investigation 54-nation Organization Security and Cooperation Europe. Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such mission Kosovo Yugoslav membership organization is restored. The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting Kosovo, which has 2 million residents. He said five 10 special police units had been removed Kosovo and had been returned their barracks province. One diplomat Kosovo, who spoke condition anonymity, said there has been significant redeployment Yugoslav army troops out Kosovo other parts Serbia, including mechanized brigade that pulled out Sunday. Some army units remain field, and there is enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly refugees, tens thousands whom are living hills and forests shelter. ","Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes.Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious.Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis.Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees.While the U.S. and other nations want peace, they oppose Kosovo independence, fearing it could destabilize other Albanian-populated Balkan states.","Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units.US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting.US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.US envoy tells Milosevic to pull back his military and let Albanian refugees return home.Yugoslavia claims it is taking steps to comply with peace demands.However, NATO says that UN Security Council conditions have not yet been met.US envoy gives Milosevic last minute warning to halt ethnic crackdown in Kosovo.Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas.","Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo.U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume.The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes.Yugoslavia claimed it ""is faced with the imminent danger of war"", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a ""criminal act"".Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise.","On Oct. 4, 1998 Yugoslav President Milosevic ordered his forces in Kosovo back to their barracks.While supressing the Albanian independence movement they had massacred hundreds of civilians and left 275,000+ refugees.NATO threatened airstrikes unless hostilities ceased and peace talks began.U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo.Milosevic called the NATO threat ""a criminal act"" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists.Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked.Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision."
17,"A North Korean man arrived Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum escaping his hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said. Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living hiding third country fleeing North Korea last year, Ministry Foreign Affairs and Trade said. The ministry generally uses term third country avoid naming China, which is required treaty North Korea return defectors their homeland. The ministry described Kim former athlete, said details his background and his method escape North Korea were not available. About 200 North Koreans have defected South Korea three years, including 60 so far this year. All complained severe food and fuel shortages their country. The Koreas were divided communist North and capitalist South 1945. They fought Korean War 1950-53 and never signed formal peace treaty. Hunger and malnutrition Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable effects famine North Korea, U.N. World Food Program representative said Tuesday. Though North Korea is suffering simple lack food, faltering economy Cambodia combined weak health care and education is causing similar levels malnutrition children, said Ken Davies, WFP's country director. There is enough rice. The problem is that people are too poor access it. The problem is poverty, Davies said. The WFP is currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians  15 percent population  food-for-work and direct assistance programs, Davies said he fears there are still plenty more that are not getting enough eat every day. The problem is so bad that it is only little worse North Korea, Davies said. The situation is much worse most people recognize. According recent WFP survey, 49 percent Cambodian children age 5 are stunted lack food and 20 percent suffer acute malnutrition. By comparison, similar survey North Korean children 7 found that 65 percent are stunted and 16 percent suffer acute malnutrition. Cambodia has produced rice surplus export last two years and expects another this year, WFP statistics show that 25 percent rice-growing areas account 75 percent surplus. The majority Cambodian farmers are not producing enough keep their families fed and are being increasingly saddled debts incurred when they run out reserves harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be paid rice harvest time, giving many farmers handicapped start next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack health care and ignorance modern child rearing  problems left mostly unaddressed under-funded health and education sectors Cambodia  have exacerbated food security problem, Davies said. Davies urged new government substantially increase annual expenditures health, education and rural development first step long-term solution Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty is getting worse right now and situation malnutrition children is crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmarks half its annual budget defense and security. In 1998 budget, education was allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursements three ministries are only 60 70 percent budgeted amount annual revenues fall short expectations, according aid workers. A 1999 budget draft proposed reduction health ministry's allotment, which caused outcry September health officials and U.N. World Health Program. The draft was later readjusted provide unprecedented 33 percent increase health spending. North Korea is entering its fourth winter chronic food shortages its people malnourished and risk dying normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday. The officials warned international complacency and hostility North Korea food crisis stretches and isolated communist country shows little willingness adopt far-reaching changes revive its ruined economy. Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine any part world, said Margareta Wahlstrom, Red Cross' undersecretary disaster relief, who returned Beijing Tuesday week inspecting aid agency's operations North Korea. She and other Red Cross officials saw further ravages North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied only half capital, Pyongyang, time; elderly looking swollen, sign long-term hunger; generation children stunted, 10-year-olds looking 6-year-olds and 5-year-olds 2-year-olds. Everywhere, bakeries government ministries, people were being served noodles and cakes made soybeans mixed acorns, grass and herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg likened additives cattle food and noted that doctors reported rise stomach illnesses mixtures. This is really part daily life, she said. You would not give them your children or your elderly mother knowing she would get cramps her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach was moaning. Three years floods and drought that started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, already teetering loss its Soviet bloc trading partners. With few goods or money barter or buy foreign supplies, country lacks sufficient fertilizer crops, and fuel and parts machinery. The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers and people harvesting cabbage, winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest is finished and U.N. estimates little improved last year's: 3 million tons, only enough meet two-thirds needs North Korea's 22 million people. As long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm and official statistics show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis rise and hunger-weakened patients unable recover operations and sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry that respiratory illnesses so common winter may take toll weakened population, she said. One 10-bed hospital countryside was keeping only three patients time because it not have food care more, said Heiberg. The Red Cross wants focus its latest dlrs 9 million appeal getting essential medicines and blankets and warm clothes North Korea. Food aid is largely being turned U.N. agencies. Despite catastrophic hunger home, North Korea plans send 317 athletes and officials next month's Asian Games Thailand, South Korean officials said Thursday. It will be largest sports delegation communist country has sent abroad recent years. North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes his country will compete 21 events Bangkok, hoping win medals women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing. Chang made remarks interview published recently Chosun Shinbo, newspaper run pro-North Korean residents Japan, said Seoul's Naewoe Press, which obtained report. Chang said North Korea was sending large delegation Bangkok prepare 2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea not enter last Asian Games, Hiroshima, Japan, 1994. It sent only 18 athletes and officials Winter Olympics Nagano, Japan, February. Naewoe is run South Korea's main government intelligence agency and specializes monitoring communist news media. Three years floods and drought that started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, forcing country rely aid feed its 23 million people. Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year last and could be worse, senior U.N. aid official said Saturday. North Korea needs minimum 4.5 million 5 million tons grain feed its 23 million people, managed last year harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head World Food Program said. Although hard figures are not available, prospects this year are that harvest will not be any better, Ngongi told reporters Beijing visiting North Korea. It may be worse last year. Poor harvests, economic collapse and three years floods and drought, have produced chronic food shortages North Korea and left it heavily reliant foreign aid. Fertilizer is lacking, is fuel power tractors and farm machinery, meaning most planting and harvesting must be done hand. Every year it gets worse, Ngongi said. But need food aid, Ngongi said government month ago cut number counties which WFP has access 171 145, reducing number people who can get aid 6.7 million 5.8 million. Most those receiving WFP aid are children aged 6 months and 6 years. Ngongi said government cited security concerns  notably lack peace treaty its rival South Korea  its decision. The government said ban would be temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, who spent four days inspecting WFP relief efforts North Korea, said people generally looked better visit last year. But he also said he could see that large part population is very weak. Everybody has been consuming very low level. So they may not be severely malnourished, they are not well nourished all, he said. U.S. officials who toured some hardest-hit regions North Korea this summer said 2 million people may have died because famine. Ngongi said he saw malnourished children who were said be 10 or 11 years old, appeared be only 4 or 5 years old. About 30 percent children one primary school he visited were not class. A lot children were too weak come school, he said. But Ngongi said foreign food aid has saved lives. A lot people are alive today thanks international community's support, he said. A congressman who visited remote parts North Korea last week said Saturday that food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions North Koreans might have starved death last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who has had longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo his return United States and showed photographs he had taken North Korean children patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores and other signs severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag what officials called substitute food being distributed government food station: dried leaves and straw, so coarse that cattle would normally turn away. They grind it powder and make it noodles, Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomachs, he said. North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulties, there have been sharply diverging assessments how serious these are. Some visitors United Nations and other organizations have said that food situation seems be bit better now year or two ago. Hall said that divergence might have arisen because North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem be slightly better his three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas where foreigners are not allowed visit, he added, overall situation is worse ever. Based visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasized that public health care had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants were holding patient while surgeons conducted stomach operation electric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienated would-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations has repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal has raised less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced that it was pulling its staff 13 North Korea because it feared that its aid was going politically connected rather most needy. North Korea does not release mortality figures or health statistics, Hall said that United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent North Korean children age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent all children are physically stunted. Hall said he thought that overall least 1 million people had died and that total was probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness which professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently published estimates suggesting that North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million and has fallen 21.23 million this year. That would be decline 320,000 three years, period when North Korea's population would have been expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figures, says that there simply is not enough hard information him estimate death toll famine. But he notes one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly not expand previous ones did, rather had just 687 delegates, same previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, eight years which it had been expected add several million people, is now back 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States has been supplying grain North Korea, strains are growing secret underground complex North that some experts worry may be heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warned last week that agreed framework that is basis its relations North Korea will be jeopardy unless North lets American experts visit underground complex and resolve their doubts. North Korea has said that it will show complex only if Washington promises that if complex is not nuclear one, it will pay vilifying us and impairing our prestige. Washington refuses pay, and North Korea is warning that standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand is open infringement our sovereignty and wanton interference our internal affairs, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More five years severe food shortages and near-total breakdown public health system have led devastating malnutrition North Korea and probably left entire generation children physically and mentally impaired, new study international aid groups has found. The study, first scientific nutritional survey North Korea, confirms disturbing reports international aid workers, who year have gained increasing access population this highly isolated and secretive country. Among other shocking findings, researchers World Food Program, Unicef and European Union found that, because long-term food shortages, staggering 62 percent children 7 years old suffer stunted growth. They have discovered that, huge international food aid program three years, severe malnutrition is widespread toddlers crucial stages brain development, suggesting that this generation's physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and that losses can never be recovered. Separately, international medical workers groups Red Cross, have begun document how effects food shortages are being severely compounded breakdown public health services. Even basic water purification systems stand idle lack essential ingredients chlorine, Red Cross workers say, leaving vast numbers people such severe diarrhea that they are unable absorb completely what little food they have. As North Korean dictatorship has slowly, grudgingly, granted increased access international aid groups last six months, increasingly clear and saddening picture hunger haas emerged result large formal study and informal surveys and observations foreign aid agencies. Past assessments magnitude disaster country 23 million are considered flawed because they were based interviews small number North Korean refugees who had fled China. And while researchers and aid workers ground North Korea have not seen evidence cannibalism or starving children dying roadside  descriptions that have surfaced more lurid refugee reports  what they find was many ways equally disturbing: A population withering nearly decade chronic hunger, people so weakened malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, future generation irretrievably lost. Now last we have hard facts  situation is very grave, said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director Asia World Food Program, which has taken part research. To me this is famine slow motion. People cope year year, and probably lot drop off. But totality is very hard gauge. For three weeks this fall, crews led foreign scientists were finally permitted fan out North Korea conduct first random sample nutritional survey children, providing far most solid data crisis. They found that 62 percent children 7 had stunted growth, symptom long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 1-year-olds suffered moderate severe malnutrition. This means high likelihood impaired mental and physical development, because nervous system matures dramatically this essential first year. The researchers said that available scientific data suggest that 10 years ago, malnutrition was rare North Korea. Even if situation improves, it is unlikely improve degree that country will fully recover what we saw, said Judit Katona-Apte, senior program adviser World Food Program. People will be small and not well developed otherwise and somewhat limited their mental capacities. Likewise, when Red Cross representatives this year tested water supply 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate, they found that not one had water that was suitable human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head Red Cross delegation North Korea. But course they drink it  they have no choice, he said recent trip Beijing. There is very close relationship problems caused lack food and health sector that's very bad shape. Virtually all children 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said. None aid groups has been able study issue hunger-related deaths, and North Koreans have not released relevant figures, although most experts agree that probably more one million and perhaps many three million have died prematurely food shortages began. But public health experts say number who have perished might be difficult tally any case, because most deaths were probably not quick starvation, immune systems weakened years hunger, so that common colds more easily give way lethal pneumonia and ordinary bout infectious diarrhea proves fatal. Still, there are some disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted World Food Program and other groups last year 4,000 children hand-picked government, 10 percent had parent who was dead. In this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams experts sent eight North Korea's nine provinces looked 1,800 rural and urban children seven. In addition finding that 62 percent children had stunted growth, teams found that 16 percent children were suffering acute malnutrition and were underweight their height, sign that they were severely underfed time study. That figure is higher any country East Asia and puts North Korea world's worst 10 countries terms malnutrition. While that 16 percent figure is not quite bad that India and Bangladesh, worst world 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number some ways understates problem. In India and Bangladesh, pockets severe poverty alternate pockets relative plenty, while North Korea whole country is some degree underfed. Even war-torn countries, famine is more pockets, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard think another country that's been affected this way. The survey results are especially sobering researchers studied only children 7, group that received nearly all food donated abroad. After three years food donations, many foreign aid workers country have remarked that children nurseries and kindergartens are looking better  that their older siblings are failing. So month ago, World Food Program began providing elementary schools high nutrition biscuits children aged 7 12. We have reason believe that many people are suffering and that elderly are neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker, Swedlund said. There are now more 100 Westerners living Pyongyang, capital city, and many say long-term hunger is readily apparent there. If you walk street Pyongyang and ask child how old she is, you are three years, Swedlund said. She may be 7 she looks just 3 or 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, nutrition expert who has worked Bangladesh and Sudan, said she was shocked when she first visited North Korean kindergarten last year. There were these two children sitting desk who were obviously severely malnourished  they were so thin and they had patchy hair, she said. And they were just sitting there working. This is accepted normal! They are school, and they should really be hospitalized or placed nutritional rehabilitation. If you saw them refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention. But severely depleted public health and hospital system, that option does not exist, she and said. Many Korean doctors do not know how diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it this decade. And, any case, hospitals lack food and proper nutritional supplements. Swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines, had no glass replace broken windows and were colder out, having received no coal 1994. He said that hospitals, sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent, because country lacks chlorine purification and fuel run water pumps. He said that next year, Red Cross would start address those problems, spending $3.5 food hospital patients and $1 million water treatment. With few other options, vast numbers North Koreans have resorted eating substitute food, hard cakes and noodles made mix nutritional plants, soybeans and sweet potatoes, combined indigestible filler, cornstalks and straw. This now constitutes 40 percent food intake, Swedlund said. It's becoming regular part food basket. Doctors North Korea say many people suffer stomachaches eating this partly indigestible material, he said, added, If you're very hungry, it fills your stomach. Although North Koreans date their food problems series floods and droughts mid-1990's, foreign researchers who have worked North Korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that hunger began several years that and is linked collapse Soviet Union, which had long been North Korea's main supplier food, fuel and fertilizer. North Korea is mountainous country, less 20 percent arable land. It has been food importer decades, mostly former Soviet Union, also China. The country has come grips fact that this is part structural problem and can't just be blamed weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, she and praised normally rigid and secretive government slowly loosening its restrictions. Swedlund said that three years country, international Red Cross, which collaborates North Korean Red Cross, had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing share medical records and bring problems. Travel is still restricted. There are more 100 counties, home 30 percent population, which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused provide food or medical supplies. Still, number counties open workers has increased steadily, and freedom move has improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said half follow-up inspections were now unannounced, and she noted that researchers nutritional survey were allowed select villages visit and enter homes random. Workers Red Cross and World Food Program said they had not observed extreme scenes people dying acute starvation and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently. I have not seen acute starvation I have seen Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're still really limited what we can see. Swedlund said it was unlikely that counties still closed foreigners were markedly different open ones.

The sudden arrest Monday night Xu, well several other activists involved him trying form China Democratic Party, set strong protests human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents and Washington. We view his detention peacefully exercising fundamental freedoms guaranteed international human rights instruments serious step wrong direction, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Washington Tuesday. U.S. officials Beijing urged government release Xu and asked clarification exact nature his crime. China signed International Covenant Civil and Political Rights great fanfare October, and Xu's arrest is seen human rights groups test nation's commitment its tenets. Dissidents and out China rose Xu's defense, more dozen activists country announcing that they would begin fasts support Xu and another leader China Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested his home Wuhan Monday. Almost 200 dissidents signed letter Chinese government protesting detentions, said Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement Hong Kong. Three other Democratic Party organizers were also detained Monday, although two them were released early Wednesday. But two more prominent dissidents, Xu and Qin, are likely face much longer haul have been charged criminal acts. Xu's wife, He Xintong, said Wednesday night that she had still not been informed specific charge her husband, although she surmised aggressive behavior arresting officers that sentence could be long. Qin's family was told that he was charged plotting subvert government, crime that serious offenses commands sentences three years life. In Chinese criminal code, this charge comes grab-bag section called threatening state security, which makes almost any political activity that questions or hampers authority Communist Party illegal, violent or nonviolent activities aimed overthrowing government authorities, activities designed change basic nature state. Xu's and Qin's trouble almost certainly stems their efforts gain recognition China Democratic Party, loose network pro-democracy activists more dozen cities China that was formed this year. In last six months they have become increasingly aggressive and defiant their attempts register party government, submitting repeated applications local authorities had declared concept opposition party illegal. They say Chinese Constitution does not specifically forbid formation new political parties, although there have been no new parties founding People's Republic 1949. In fact, by-laws China Democratic Party are fairly tame; they carefully acknowledge central role Communist Party, also support free speech and free elections public officials. My husband thought time was right begin working form new party, China recently signed covenant human rights, Ms. He said. In September, few Democratic Party members got some slightly encouraging signals local governments, which initially accepted their applications form social organization develop party. But recent weeks, organizers Xu became more insistent and defiant, harassment police increased. All this week we felt something was going happen, Ms. He said. It seemed that anyone who came visit us was later detained while. And there have been lot more cars Public Security Bureau parked is usual. Hours China was expected sign key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled prominent human rights campaigner questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in authorities came he tried second time week legally register human rights monitoring group. Qin said civil affairs official Hubei provincial capital Wuhan accused him engaging illegal activities. The police came soon he returned home. As I'm sending this statement, Wuhan Public Security Bureau is again taking me away, Qin said hastily scrawled message bottom typed statement faxed reporters. Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned three hours being released and threatened prosecution if he persisted trying set his China Human Rights Observer. Qin hoped harassment would stop China signs International Covenant Civil and Political Rights, he said if local authorities don't observe treaty we will unswervingly push ahead protecting human rights last. China plans sign International Covenant Civil and Political Rights Monday United Nations. By time ink is dry, Blair should be landing Beijing Tuesday morning first visit British prime minister seven years. The treaty is supposed guarantee freedoms speech and assembly. But China signs, treaty would not come force ratified legislature, which may attach reservations effectively nullifying some provisions. Blair has vowed discuss differences human rights Chinese leaders. His visit has drawn appeals dissidents and international press freedom group urging him persuade Chinese leaders free political prisoners. In open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leaders say they respect human rights principles, law and practice government allows rights abuses and persecution dissidents. Thousands political prisoners are believed remain Chinese prisons, labor camps or detention centers, said letter, copy which was released Hong Kong-based Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China. The letter called release Shi Binhai, journalist who compiled popular book political change; Fang Jue, businessman who called openly political reform; and other imprisoned activists. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders urged Blair call release Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng. The three are 13 journalists imprisoned simply attempting practice their profession, it said statement. Protesting lack defense lawyer, father prominent dissident is seek delay his son's subversion trial, scheduled start Thursday central city Wuhan. The defendant is Qin Yongmin, 45, democracy advocate who has spent 10 years prison and labor camps and has recently promoted alternative, non-Communist political party. In telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, Qin Qinguo, 76, said that trial begins, he plans hand court written plea postponement. If plea is ignored, he said he will walk out. I wouldn't be able stand it, father, retired steelworker, said, citing his frail health and high blood pressure. Under China's code criminal procedure, defendant has right defense lawyer. But this case, elder Qin said, some lawyers he approached declined take case, while were warned security officials not get involved. The father said he not agree his son's political tactics now he felt he had no choice protest his treatment. Qin Yongmin was arrested Nov. 30, only hours his mother died stroke. He wasn't allowed attend funeral, Qin Qinguo said. And now he's not allowed find lawyer. On Thursday morning, few hundred miles east city Hangzhou, Wang Youcai, 33, is go trial similar charges inciting subversion. He, too, has no defense lawyer. Wang was leader student demonstrations Tiananmen Square 1989 and served two years prison they were put military force. As founder suppressed new political party, China Democracy Party, he publicly announced its charter June President Clinton's visit China. Scores people country began champion new party, hopeful that closer ties China and United States, and China's signing international covenant political and civil rights, would mean looser political climate. But party was soon declared illegal and many adherents were detained, least temporarily. Wang now faces charges that could land him prison five years or more. A third veteran dissident and promoter new party, Xu Wenli, has been detained weeks Beijing and is expected face similar subversion charges. In last two days, least 10 Democracy Party members or supporters Hangzhou area have been detained police and have had their phone lines cut, reported Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China, based Hong Kong. The separate trials two prominent democracy advocates inciting subversion state opened Thursday morning, families defendants protesting their inability hire defense lawyers. The trial eastern city Hangzhou Wang Youcai, 32, founder China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was session just two hours and 10 minutes. It appears be finished, although court not announce decision or say when it would. I don't know what happens here, said Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, who was one three relatives allowed attend trial. I don't hold much hope, she added telephone interview. Wang, who spent two years prison 1989 student demonstrations Tiananmen Square, was accused organizing political party that sought overturn Communist Party rule and colluding foreign enemies state. He could face five years or more prison. Since all lawyers his family approached were intimidated security agents, Ms. Hu said, Wang tried mount his defense Thursday morning prosecutors laid out their case. But judge frequently interrupted him and cut him half hour, saying he was not responding specific facts case, she added. Wang argued that his activities were legal China's constitution and international covenant political rights that China has signed, Ms. Hu said. In central city Wuhan, trial similar charges Qin Yongmin, 45, veteran dissident, also continued something two hours. It will apparently be continued, said Qin's father, Qin Qingguo, session ended prosecution presented its charges. In that case, too, prospective lawyers had been intimidated or detained, family members said. The elderly father's request court Thursday morning postponement was ignored, so he and one defendant's brothers stayed court building protest, leaving another brother inside. We didn't feel there was any reason observe trial because if Qin Yongmin not have defense attorney, then far we were concerned proceedings were meaningless, father said telephone. The U.S. Embassy asked observe trials. When embassy official arrived court Hangzhou Thursday morning, he was told that there were no seats available and instead waited outside, greeting Ms. Hu when she emerged, shaken, brief trial. Police detained and questioned organizer group set dissidents monitor official corruption and told him group's activities must cease, human rights group said Thursday. Police Xinyang, central China's Henan province, took An Jun away Wednesday afternoon and held him midnight questioning group's members, said Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China. Police wanted list members their work and home addresses, demand An Jun refused fear getting them trouble, Hong Kong-based Information Center said. Corruption Watch, founded nine dissidents seven provinces, now has nearly 100 members, center said. It applied last month government register officially, received no response, center added. The police officers who questioned An Jun said that official permission, group must cease its activities, center said. Rampant official corruption is major public gripe China. The Information Center said Corruption Watch had already received reports graft its first month operation. In separate report, center said that official Sichuan provincial government refused Thursday accept application three dissidents form branch would-be opposition group, China Democracy Party. Groups dissidents cities China have attempted register group, required law, authorities have rejected those applications. Signaling that Communist Party's 49-year-old ban opposition groups remains intact, police have detained and questioned many dissidents associated group. With attorneys locked up, harassed or plain scared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves charges subversion Thursday China's highest-profile dissident trials two years. Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's families were running out options Wednesday help pair, leading organizers budding opposition political party. Qin's family pleaded postponement Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, court officials denied request. Police have detained one lawyer and threatened another, and subtler pressures have been used others, family members said. Given interference, Wang Youcai's wife assumes he will be convicted. Whether he has lawyer or not, he says, government has already decided, Hu Jiangxia said. Qin and Wang will be tried separately, cities 500 kilometers (300 miles) apart and proceedings attended only family and few observers selected courts. Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, are accused inciting subversion state power, apparently helping organize China Democracy Party. They face 10 years life imprisonment if convicted harshest aspects law. By moving Qin, Wang and China Democracy Party, ruling Communist Party appears be signaling its determination crush challenges its monopoly power. Authorities have detained or questioned more 30 people associated party 17-day-old crackdown. Qin, democracy campaigner 20 years, and Wang, student leader 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are most active and influential members China's dissident community. A third prominent member dissident community, Xu Wenli, was also arrested crackdown, not charged. To prevent displays solidarity Wang's trial, police have detained least ten dissidents eastern city Hangzhou, Hong Kong-based rights group reported. The Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China said many more are missing and believed be custody. To prosecute Wang, authorities violated minimal rights guaranteed suspects Chinese law and ignored court orders, his wife said. Even judge asked me hire lawyer, while I was doing this, some people were doing things stop me, Hu Jiangxia said. During one meeting potential defense attorney, police official stormed and said, `Don't do anything them. Don't take this case. Whoever takes case, you can't win,' Hu recounted. Four law firms refused take Qin's case, his brother Qin Xiaoguang said. The Information Center said one lawyer who initially agreed represent Qin Monday went missing four hours and then called Qin's family withdraw. Dispirited harsh treatment, Qin's family argued whether attend trial. Qin Xiaoguang said he and his father have decided stay away protest unfairness, another brother will go. Three dissidents northeastern China sent open letter China's legislature and Supreme People's Court appealing fair trials, Information Center said. It added that authorities violated China's laws not ensuring Wang and Qin have adequate representation. The letter was latest string petitions demonstrating appeal Wang and Qin and idea China Democracy Party. Since Wang publicly announced June that he and Hangzhou were setting party, dissidents least 14 provinces and cities have set party branches. Authorities have refused their applications register party required law. Wang and Qin are most well-known dissidents China has put trial Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan 1996. He was convicted subversion and served less two 11-year sentence. In return his release, he agreed go exile. A Chinese dissident fleeing new arrests democracy activists Shanghai arrived here Wednesday and announced that he and other opponents Chinese government plan demonstration Thursday United Nations protest crackdown. The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who was released April Chinese labor camp, is leader China Democracy Party, which was formed June President Clinton's visit China. Speaking interpreter Kennedy International Airport, Yao, 44, said little why he had left Shanghai, that he and his younger brother, Yao Zhenxiang, 38, had been sent labor camp 1996 trumped-up charge publishing pornography. The younger Yao, who is also prominent figure China Democracy Party, is scheduled release April. Last week Chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers China Democracy Party, one whom, Wang Youcai, is go trial Dec. 17. The Chinese government feels it expanded too quickly, Yao said airport, referring his party. Washington gave Yao special visa, which expires February. Dr. Wang Bingzhang, 50, adviser overseas committee party, said later that Yao had left China personal and political reasons. They were scared all time, he said, referring Yao's wife, Yu Yingzhang, and daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompanied him. The family had terrible life, especially daughter. Secret agents followed them all time. The family trading business, which was 12 years old, was shuttered government 1996, said Wang, former surgeon Beijing, so they had no way living. In addition, Yao made organizational trips several provinces, democracy activists urged him go abroad, Wang said. They wanted him tell truth what is really happening China and call whole world pay attention, Wang said. Beatrice Laroche, liaison United Nations Human Rights China, New York-based group, said China Democracy Party was growing presence some China's most populous provinces, including Sichuan. But their most vocal leaders have all recently been detained, she added. Ms. Laroche said Yao brothers, especially younger man, won prominence helping finance predecessors China Democracy Party money family business it was closed government.

24,"This is what Newt Gingrich is supposed do well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought GOP majority Congress 1994 and made him first Republican House Speaker 40 years. But his admission, Gingrich's vision seems have blurred this time around, costing Republicans net five seats Tuesday's election and leaving party's narrow governing majority narrower. The disappointing election results also left Gingrich open fractious challenge his post speaker. Members and aides said Wednesday that fury speaker had bubbled overnight and that some members were trying organize slate candidates replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans convene Nov. 18 select their leaders next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When company's stock price goes down, it's CEO who gets fired. Top Republican aides, speaking anonymously, were blunter. People were very angry last night, one aide said. Today it's mixture seething and dismay. It's just ugly. And Newt knows it. His career is line. Another aide said, Most people are really angry Newt, and no one knows what do it. But some are dipping their toe water and seeing what temperature is. A possible slate could contain names Reps. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana replace Gingrich, Steve Largent Oklahoma replace Dick Armey Texas majority leader, and Jennifer Dunn Washington replace John A. Boehner Ohio conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh Indiana is also said be run speaker, it was not clear whether he would be part any slate. Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, was said be secure. Armey bluntly acknowledged scramble going wings oust leadership. Told Nightline that there were Republicans his head, Armey replied: They're welcome it if they're big enough take it. Publicly, Gingrich has expressed confidence keeping his job speaker. But he has been grim-faced last 24 hours and closeted himself Wednesday his top strategists making calls shore his support members. He looks victim accident, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who supports Gingrich. He's very somber tone. The question, it always is Gingrich, is how many members are prepared rebel his leadership. In past, no more couple dozen members have openly expressed their dissatisfaction him, and coup attempt last year fizzled lack support. I'm hoping more people will understand need serious reassessment this year, said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., who said he had hoped challenge speaker 1996 elections, when Republicans also lost seats. The reality is this: Our majority keeps shrinking, Canady said. If it shrinks any more, it will be gone. But Gingrich has built support moderates, and some perceived election repudiation conservatives. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said results showed that this was right direction party. To maintain our majority, we've got moderate some our views, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, Congressional scholar Brookings Institution, said that moderates supported Gingrich part because no appealing alternative had emerged. They know he sees broader world and is prepared moderate if it makes sense, Mann said. Newt's gone out his way support moderates. He's nurtured relationship them. But Mann and said that anger has been building Gingrich several reasons, including his signing budget deal last month that seemed capitulate President Clinton, not offering clear legislative agenda Republicans and not communicating clear political message. We are most defined who we hate said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voters are more sophisticated that, and Republicans better have something say where we're going. The anger grew last few days when speaker approved $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign that allowed Democrats turn election referendum Gingrich, who has never been nearly popular public Clinton has been. As if only slowly absorbing implications loss, speaker seemed unable news conference here Wednesday morning pinpoint why party suffered net drop five seats House. As late Tuesday afternoon, he was predicting net pickup 10 and 30. Until we look it better, I frankly don't understand all things that happened yesterday, he said, and I'm not sure anybody else country does either. But he said Republicans should have maniacally focused basic message cutting taxes, saving Social Security and preventing drug abuse, and campaigned aggressively those themes. He contrasted lack focus this year Contract With America that proved so successful 1994. People thought we stood something pretty big, he said. But Gingrich also seemed aware mounting concern his leadership, repeatedly casting election results victory his leadership team because Republicans had stayed majority three elections row first time 70 years. He also suggested that those who would challenge him have little support. The people who normally are quoted this are people who would fact take party narrower base, Gingrich said, referring periodic eruptions concern conservatives his leadership. I'd see who it was that had plan that they were confident last 60 days would have been more successful and why they didn't share it. An intense struggle control House is underway, Rep. Bob Livingston conducting telephone campaign replace Rep. Newt Gingrich speaker and Gingrich fighting counter-campaign that has given some members pause ousting him. At same time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday that they would not vote re-elect Gingrich any circumstances, move that, because Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knots months because it could throw speakership Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have made decision that I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, and there are six who have told me they feel same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six deadlock vote. Fury speaker has boiled Tuesday's elections, when Republicans suffered net loss five seats House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many were already angry him what they said was his failure articulate clear message party going elections and messy budget process that gave President Clinton political edge and contradicted Republican principles fiscal conservativism containing massive amounts pork spending. House Republicans are meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot their leaders. Whoever wins party's nomination speaker then stands election full House January. Even if Gingrich wins secret ballot, he could be denied re-election speaker January if Salmon and least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans now control House only 12 seats, it would take just six votes Gingrich deny him majority and allow Democrats potentially elect one their speaker. With such chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside good party, according Republican officials. The officials said that Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly disastrous election returns also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said that Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee and one few members stature stand speaker, and Gingrich were working phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston has said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members and aides said Thursday that he would announce his intentions, possibly soon Friday, he had determined if he could win. He won't do it 'til he has his ducks row, and right now lot people are still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, many others, is trying straddle line fealty speaker who may retain power and encouragement challenger who offers salve embattled party. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore each other Wednesday who was blame their failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations  and possibility congressional leadership challenges  came election results showed that Republicans had been unable increase their 55-45 hold Senate and that Democrats had picked five seats House. The Democratic surge marked first time 1934 that president's party had gained seats midterm election, and it whittled Republican House majority mere six votes. The Democratic victories were more remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon holds win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House they captured it again 1994. With attention now shifting House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday that only witness Republicans were likely call would be independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmakers he hoped have committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act that would take issue out his hands and put it Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday they could discuss Hyde's plan themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., that Republicans still held House three elections row first time election 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burned phone lines each other, discussing whether mount leadership challenges chambers next few weeks. We've got reach out and have more southern white males running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said that Republicans this year had been left any accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, he said. We went entire calendar year agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss and said simply, There are going be major changes our leadership. All segments our party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election results vindication his party's policies. If you look all results, he said, they are clear and unambiguous. The American people want their business, their concerns, their children, their families, their future addressed here. That's what messag e election was. One first difficult questions now facing Congress is how proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, and Republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that 218 votes required impeachment cannot be assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues have clear constituional duty complete its work fair and expeditious manner. Our duty has not changed becasue constitution has not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election results guaranteed that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort remove President Clinton office is effectively over, he said. It is simply Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From other side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrapped expeditiously, fairly and it ought be resolved immediate future. For year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228-207 majority and find consensus their party's competing factions. With their numbers reduced, Republican leadership will need carry out tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction that wants more aggressive social agenda bloc moderates who want their party return center. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, taking control away Republican leaders. Already seeing some possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It gives us much more leverage leadership and makes it easier protect New York, he said. It's going weaken position strident conservatives and anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gains ranging 10 seats more 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting results. Things were happening out there that none us fully understand--neither party my judgment, he said. Taking his share blame his party's losses, Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how public would recoil Clinton scandal amplified modern media world and how scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimated degree which people would just get sick 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then degree which this whole scandal became just sort disgusting sheer repetition, he said. And result I think we probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting taxes and saving Social Security, winning war drugs, reforming education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistakes, saying his party had not presented clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble pass $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lessons Republicans out this is that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he said Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shoring Social Security system. Even two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers were making phone calls trying assess whether mount challenges Republican leaders who have steered Congress Republican's assumed control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer said House had become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably are going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when Republican governors are doing so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich has not gone out his way identify himself Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible. Gingrich has faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt him disgruntled conservatives and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remains long-shot. But House leadership elections now set mid-November, Republicans said this time dissatisfaction their caucus had crossed ideological lines moderates Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conserative Utah. We beat ourselves because we had no agenda. Republicans were discussing possible challenges Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him said they expected anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership races take place early December, some Republicans were talking mounting challenges mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who poured party dollars and much his time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold won close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked more eight senators, and was whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This is big loss us, he said. We squandered very historic opportunity last night. To just break is loss. Most incumbents coasted victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid  Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat was leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement was not expected Friday absentee ballots are counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elected members are career politicians who rose ranks local and state government. Three Democrats are sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former Congressman and Secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who o won Texas seat his father, Henry.

The Democrats held 206 seats, and one was held indepenndent. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, taking control away Republican leaders. Already seeing some possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It gives us much more leverage leadership and makes it easier protect New York, he said. It's going weaken position strident conservatives and anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gains ranging 10 seats more 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting results. Things were happening out there that none us fully understand--neither party my judgment, he said. Taking his share blame his party's losses, Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how public would recoil Clinton scandal amplified modern media world and how scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimated degree which people would just get sick 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then degree which this whole scandal became just sort disgusting sheer repetition, he said. And result I think we probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting taxes and saving Social Security, winning war drugs, reforming education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistakes, saying his party had not presented clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble pass $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lessons Republicans out this is that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he said Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shoring Social Security system. Even two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers were making phone calls trying assess whether mount challenges Republican leaders who have steered Congress Republican's assumed control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer said House had become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably are going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when Republican governors are doing so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich has not gone out his way identify himself Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible. Gingrich has faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt him disgruntled conservatives and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remains long-shot. But House leadership elections now set mid-November, Republicans said this time dissatisfaction their caucus had crossed ideological lines moderates Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat ourselves because we had no agenda. Republicans were discussing possible challenges Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him said they expected anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership races take place early December, some Republicans were talking mounting challenges mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who poured party dollars and much his time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold won close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked more eight senators, and was whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This is big loss us, he said. We squandered very historic opportunity last night. To just break is loss. Most incumbents coasted victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid  Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat was leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement was not expected Friday absentee ballots are counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elected members are career politicians who rose ranks local and state government. Three Democrats are sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman and secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who won Texas seat his father, Henry. A week White House and congressional Democrats disavowed his war Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief defender, put forth new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled. Not only that, Carville went his customary denunciations Gingrich and Republicans and, interview, trained his fire leaders his party not being sufficiently aggressive four weeks Election Day. My sense frustration is that I believe Democrats have much better chance doing much better anyone expects, Carville said. And I don't think anyone's emerging try pull it together. Everybody ought be pushing, leadership Congress, White House, DNC. We ought hammer Gingrich every day. How can you take Congress back if you don't make case people who are running it? I have never heard strategy that. Sounding increasingly agitated, he went on: The only people left be activated this election are Democrats. The right wing, they're bouncing walls. They're going out vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, complained Erskine Bowles, White House chief staff, Carville appeared NBC News program Meet Press Sept. 27 and declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville will be rolling battle Newt Gingrich. The concern House Democrats, one expressed some White House officials well, was that Carville's vitriol would make Democrats appear overly partisan and could be especially damaging Democrats marginal districts who do not want appear too easy president. But Wednesday, Carville was anything timid. If Gephardt people think they've quieted me down, he said, I'm not quieted. Carville said he told officials White House, Don't waste your breath calling me and telling me not say this. Carville insisted that he would rather do battle Republicans his fellow Democrats. If they want fight me, they can, he said. I'm going fight Republicans. Yet he could not help ridicule his party. Asked describe Democrats' strategy election, Carville said, If there is one, no one's shared it me. Just four years ago, it was good bet that Newt Gingrich would be pivotal figure U.S. politics turn millennium. Seemingly overnight he had taken moribund minority party and turned it pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With promise balance budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social values, he appeared have rearranged political map Congress just Ronald Reagan had done presidency. But Gingrich's leadership is now so shaky that if he maintains his hold speaker's office, he is danger marginalization. A change this dramatic suggests something far more profound miscalculation election tactics. What looked one major realignments U.S. political history might turn out have been nothing temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution was fueled anger, revolt white working-class Americans what they perceived Democratic bias favor blacks and other minorities, and middle-class rejection politics big government and big deficits. They were same resentments that Ronald Reagan had exploited so successfully. But old political habits and moribund Republican leadership allowed Democrats retain control Congress throughout 1980s, and turned Reagan's economic program undisciplined tax-cutting spree that created prosperity huge budget gaps. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent political organization finally took Reagan's formula success congressional elections 1994. But once power, he ran head Bill Clinton, whose political instincts were better. The president co-opted parts Contract With America, particularly balanced budget and welfare reform. He adapted Republican social message call things school uniforms and television rating systems, which symbolized more responsibility and parental control supporting government intrusion private lives. The Republican right's genuine contempt Clinton was based part well-known flaws president's character. But it was mainly reaction ease which he had diverted what was supposed be flood tide their revolution. They expected that genuine successes Gingrich's first year office would lead still larger victories minimal government and taxes, unfettered free enterprise and return conservative Christian values. But public was happy be led another direction, and focus concerns aging baby boomers health care and Social Security. The government that was seen enemy when issues were budgetary once again looked potential ally. Back 1994, parties were so stunned sudden change their congressional fortunes that they may have overestimated what it all meant. In particular they may not have realized how quickly good economic times, drop crime and national welfare reform could blunt power race U.S. politics. The Democrats had become literally minority party white voters resentfully identified their policies cities, blacks and immigrants. But last week union workers and Catholics returned Democratic fold. Without race wedge issue, solid black Democratic vote became powerful advantage key states. Blacks, women and Latinos angry Republican anti-immigration initiatives were winning coalition California, North Carolina and New York. The speaker was right say this was not election we expected. There may indeed be Republican majority America, it appears resemble Republicanism Dwight Eisenhower rather Newt Gingrich  pro-business, wary debt and inherent distaste bringing messy social issues abortion. The Republicans who have begun talking compassionate conservatism and politics inclusion may be peddling political mush, they peddled it victory Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn wilderness House minority may have left it too accustomed opposition figure out what it can be for, and too attached politics anger make sense nation mood moderation. Gingrich has suggested that his mistake was let Republicans drift politics impeachment when they should have been almost maniacally focused things tax cuts. But looking maniacal is what got them trouble first place. Winning control Congress so many years was very tough Gingrich 1994. But it will be ten times tougher forge politics that does not depend rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated Republican revolution recent years and is overseeing impeachment inquiry President Clinton, was driven office Friday party that swiftly turned him its unexpected losses Tuesday's midterm elections. Catching virtually everyone Capitol Hill surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night two conference calls other Republicans that he would not seek re-election Speaker Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires January. This will give us chance purge some poison that is system, Gingrich said, according party aide who listened one calls. Gingrich's resignation was stunning reversal one most combative and personally confrontational politicians America. He made his name decade ago bringing one Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style Tuesday's elections last-minute commercials reminding voters Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response was evident Friday night. In his second conference call, according several people who listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives his downfall. Although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed take control Congress 1994, they have become his most bitter critics last two years his tumultuous speakership. Friday night he called them cannibals who had blackmailed him quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt said all those who had marginalized Republican Party had engaged cannibalism. He said, `Refer clips.' He's blaming others. Another Republican described conference call this way: He started very statesmanlike, then you could see anger building. When someone asked him why he was leaving, he said, `A handful members have blackmailed conference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announced his move just hours Rep. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana announced he was running speaker, putting himself forward pragmatist and manager. After Gingrich calls, Rep. Bill Archer Texas announced he was his run speaker. Livingston and Archer are chairmen two most powerful committees House. In statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference needs be unified, and it is time me move forward. He said he hoped his colleagues would pick successor who can reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively. Referring his wife, he told his colleagues he was resigning Congress because Marianne and I are tired. We need time get know each other again. He also acknowledged his knack bringing negative attention himself and his party. If I stay, he told his colleagues Friday night, my controversial nature would overshadow any successes we might have, understatement those who recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced shutdown government because he was miffed having sit back Air Force One trip President Clinton. According another Republican who took notes, Gingrich said his resignation: There is lot bitterness amongst some members. So long I am around, I will always be target news media, which would mean we would never be able get our message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich has been worthy adversary leading Republican Party majority House and joining me great national debate how best prepare America 21st century. Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we were able work together national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support America's continuing leadership freedom, peace and prosperity world. Many Republicans took opportunity portray Gingrich visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert New York said that first conference call, there was shock and surprise and strong expressions appreciation leading us Promised Land. His supporters said Gingrich had votes win election nominate speaker, which is be conducted secret ballot. But, they agreed, party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would be battle. Kenneth Duberstein, former official Reagan administration, said, I have no doubt he had votes be speaker, I'm not sure he had votes govern. He said that because deep rifts party, Gingrich would not have been able implement his plans. In unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, said he hoped that Gingrich's resignation would clear fierce partisan air that he had fostered. I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich speaker will immediately begin process repairing damage that was wrought this institution last four years, Gephardt said. House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would set more wide-ranging and hectic scramble replace him had been anticipated. There will be lot pretenders throne who will test waters, said Boehlert, who had supported Gingrich re-election speaker. There won't be any shortage candidates. The presidential campaign 2000 began Wednesday, it or not. The millennial election will be fought political playing field whose rough outlines, if not its exact boundaries, were drawn voters Tuesday's elections, which delivered crushing disappointment giddy hopes Republicans and unexpected elixir recently ailing Democrats. President Clinton called it astonishing triumph issues investigations and said Democrats had won so many major victories because they had clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course next 18 months will bring many surprises and many reversals fortune. But election results offered important guidelines. Tuesday was great day Vice President Al Gore, least three reasons. He worked furiously and successfully last ten days balloting persuade Democratic loyalists not stay home and sulk, appearing behalf no fewer 224 candidates, according his office. A moderate spectrum his party, he watched moderates win crucial elections, notably California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, cautious pragmatist Gore, won smashing victory. The returns  break Senate and Democratic gain five House Representatives  also made impeachment President Clinton less likely. And better shape Clinton is his term ends, better chance Gore, his sidekick six years now, stands presidential nomination process and, ultimately, election. But California voters also complicated nominating process and set Gore strategists work tactics uncomplicate it, because he and they consider state absolutely central his presidential aspirations. In referendum 1996, California adopted primary system which Republicans, Democrats and independent voters would all receive same ballot, candidates all parties listed. That violates rules major parties, and measure ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would have rescinded 1996 change. But it failed, raising possibility that California's March 7 primary will be mere political popularity poll, convention delegates chosen caucus or convention  nightmare. Tuesday was bad day Republican right. High-profile right-wingers lost country, Attorney General Dan Lungren California governor's race Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election North Carolina, Rep. Mark Neumann Wisconsin, who failed Senate race huge spending advantage Sen. Russell Feingold, Ellen Sauerbrey Maryland, who proved unable her second try prevail unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservatives and moderates party said Republicans had get back basics. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded that results should sober every Republican and called new strategic thinking. If you make it referendum president 67 cent approval rating, they tried do, you shouldn't be surprised if election goes you, said Gov. Tom Ridge Pennsylvania, moderate whose promoters mention him weekly possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain Arizona, conservative who tends steer away divisive social issues, won re-election 68 cent vote. He is studying possibility presidential race, he or any other Republican nominee can hope win, he said interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their leaders need learn some lessons. I just hope this debacle is wake-up call our people, he said. You've got be something  smaller government, better education, something. We're seen party that's everything. Polls taken late this year's campaign bore McCain out. They showed that Republicans are no longer identified issues that were once their electoral bread and butter, such low taxes and law and order. Tuesday was also fresh demonstration, anyone who needed one, political utility pitching tent big enough almost everyone. Black politicians North Carolina, Maryland and California reported that their fears indifferent black turnout had proved groundless. Black votes proved indispensable considerable number hard-pressed Democratic candidates, especially where they felt their interests directly threatened. The figures Hispanic voting, assembled exit polls and candidates' precinct analyses, showed dramatic differences. In California, where outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, had played anti-immigration card vengeance, major Democratic candidates  Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who won re-election trailing early polls  cleaned Hispanic voters. He took 78 percent, she 72. But Bush brothers, Jeb Florida and George W. Texas, took more half Hispanic vote their highly successful gubernatorial campaigns. So McCain. Jeb Bush is married Hispanic woman, he and his brother speak Spanish fluently and frequently, and Senator McCain has long espoused Hispanic causes. Both George W. Bush and McCain will draw strength, if they decide run, their proven ability appeal Hispanic voters, well their general electoral strength. George W. Bush took 69 percent vote Texas, where Democrat sat governor's chair only four years ago, and which has second-largest bloc electoral votes. Florida has fourth-largest. Governor Bush Texas uttered rallying cry moderates. A leader who is compassionate and conservative, he said his victory speech, can erase gender gap and open Republican party new faces and new voices. But figures right saw things differently. James Dobson, leading religious broadcaster, said that Republicans had fared poorly because Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, had caved president budget and de-emphasized social issues such abortion and flag desecration. He called all explicitly ouster Gingrich. Likewise, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate 2000, said leadership will have lot answer for. Tuesday proved potency education issue, and suggested that it will emerge major theme 2000 campaign. Clinton, his limited involvement campaign, and Gore, his extensive participation, stressed Democratic programs build more schools and hire more teachers. Almost quarter California voters  and there are now almost twice many voters California any other state  named education their most pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats won governorships Alabama and South Carolina odds, partly emphasizing their rivals' opposition lotteries that will help pay schools. In Iowa, Democrat was elected governor first time 1969 platform that featured dilapidated condition state's schools and promise remedy it. Tuesday demonstrated overriding importance money modern American politics. Feingold, one principal backers campaign-finance reform, survived fight another day, so opponents reform. And returns House races, showing that all six 401 members who sought re-election had won, underlined once again how hard it is, present system, challenger raise enough money compete effectively. The difficulties raising money may doom many would-be presidential candidacies. Gore will have what he needs, will Bush, Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander Tennessee. But how many will? Finally, Tuesday delivered indecisive message impeachment. Close two-thirds voters nationwide told exit pollsters that they intended send no message Clinton, they made it clear response other questions that they disliked House inquiry president's alleged misdeeds and wanted see it end. In only two states, Kansas and Nebraska, majority voters say they favored congressional censure Clinton, much milder form punishment advocated many Clinton backers. Some Republicans said privately that there should be no hearings all Clinton matter, and some Democrats began talking deal, equivalent plea bargain that would bring matter early close. Nevertheless, Republican members House Judiciary Committee said they needed press ahead Constitutional process that House has set motion. Among those taking that view were Rep. Bob Barr Georgia, fierce foe president, and Rep. Mary Bono California, whose tone has been more muted. But Rep. David Dreier California, incoming Rules Committee chairman, said that election has played role ensuring that one us has desire drag that out. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore each other Wednesday who was blame their failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations  and possibility congressional leadership challenges  came election results showed that Republicans had been unable increase their 55-45 hold Senate and that Democrats had picked five seats House. The Democratic surge marked first time 1934 that president's party had gained seats midterm election, and it whittled Republican House majority mere six votes. The Democratic victories were more remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon holds win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House they captured it again 1994. With attention now shifting House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday that only witness Republicans were likely call would be independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmakers he hoped have committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act that would take issue out his hands and put it Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday they could discuss Hyde's plan themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., that Republicans still held House three elections row first time election 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burned phone lines each other, discussing whether mount leadership challenges chambers next few weeks. We've got reach out and have more southern white males running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said that Republicans this year had been left any accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, he said. We went entire calendar year agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss and said simply, There are going be major changes our leadership. All segments our party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election results vindication his party's policies. If you look all results, he said, they are clear and unambiguous. The American people want their business, their concerns, their children, their families, their future addressed here. That's what message election was. One first difficult questions now facing Congress is how proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, and Republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that 218 votes required impeachment cannot be assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues have clear constitutional duty complete its work fair and expeditious manner. Our duty has not changed because constitution has not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election results guaranteed that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort remove President Clinton office is effectively over, he said. It is simply Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From other side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrapped expeditiously, fairly and it ought be resolved immediate future. For year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228 seats and find consensus their party's competing factions. With their numbers reduced, Republican leadership will need carry out tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction that wants more aggressive social agenda bloc moderates who want their party return center. The Democrats held 206 seats, and one was held indepenndent. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, taking control away Republican leaders. Already seeing some possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It gives us much more leverage leadership and makes it easier protect New York, he said. It's going weaken position strident conservatives and anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gains ranging 10 seats more 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting results. Things were happening out there that none us fully understand--neither party my judgment, he said. Taking his share blame his party's losses, Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how public would recoil Clinton scandal amplified modern media world and how scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimated degree which people would just get sick 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then degree which this whole scandal became just sort disgusting sheer repetition, he said. And result I think we probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting taxes and saving Social Security, winning war drugs, reforming education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistakes, saying his party had not presented clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble pass $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lessons Republicans out this is that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he said Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shoring Social Security system. Even two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers were making phone calls trying assess whether mount challenges Republican leaders who have steered Congress Republican's assumed control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer said House had become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably are going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when Republican governors are doing so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich has not gone out his way identify himself Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible. Gingrich has faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt him disgruntled conservatives and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remains long-shot. But House leadership elections now set mid-November, Republicans said this time dissatisfaction their caucus had crossed ideological lines moderates Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat ourselves because we had no agenda. Republicans were discussing possible challenges Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him said they expected anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership races take place early December, some Republicans were talking mounting challenges mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who poured party dollars and much his time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold won close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked more eight senators, and was whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This is big loss us, he said. We squandered very historic opportunity last night. To just break is loss. Most incumbents coasted victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid  Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat was leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement was not expected Friday absentee ballots are counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elected members are career politicians who rose ranks local and state government. Three Democrats are sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman and secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who won Texas seat his father, Henry. A struggle control House is way, Rep. Robert Livingston conducting telephone campaign that could lead him running Newt Gingrich speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign has given some members pause ousting him. At same time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday that they would not vote re-elect Gingrich any circumstances, move that, because Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knots months. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have made decision that I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, and there are six who have told me they feel same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six deadlock vote. Fury speaker has boiled Tuesday's elections, when Republicans suffered net loss five seats House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many were already angry him what they said was his failure articulate clear message party going elections and messy budget process that gave President Clinton political edge and contradicted Republican principles fiscal conservativism containing massive amounts spending local projects. House Republicans are meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot their leaders. Whoever wins Republican nomination speaker must stand election full House January. Even if Gingrich wins secret ballot, he could be denied re-election speaker January if Salmon and least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans now control House only 12 seats, it would take just six votes Gingrich deny him majority. With such chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside good party, Republican officials said. The officials said that Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly election returns also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said that Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee and one few members stature stand speaker, and Gingrich were working phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston has said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members and aides said Thursday that he would announce his intentions, possibly soon Friday, only he had determined if he could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., was one several members who spoke Livingston Thursday. He told me he's making number phone calls, that he's gotten very positive response running speaker, and he'll decide next 48 hours, King said. He won't do it till he has his ducks row, and right now lot people are still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, many others, is trying straddle line fealty speaker who may retain power and encouragement challenger who offers salve embattled party. Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich party's losses Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged next day slate candidates oppose Gingrich and his lieutenants. The list possible candidates leadership positions included Rep.e Steve Largent Oklahoma, who talked Livingston Thursday challenging Gingrich, Republican officials said, speaking condition that their names not be reported. Those officials said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted run him ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, majority leader. But, these officials said that if Livingston not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run speaker instead. Other names were floated Wednesday leadership posts. They included Reps. David McIntosh Indiana speaker and Jennifer Dunn Washington conference chairman. Added mix Thursday was name Rep. Christopher Cox, California conservative. As sign uncertainty prevailing House members Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman Judiciary Committee and one House's most venerable members, rebuffed chance endorse Gingrich speaker. Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility party's losses Tuesday. Leadership takes credit when things go right, he said. They ought take blame when things go wrong. Asked if Gingrich should remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think he will, that remains be seen. The energy that many vented publicly Wednesday anger Gingrich seemed devoted Thursday intense internal political calculations whether Livingston could succeed toppling Gingrich and whether he should succeed. While many support him veteran who understands House and has shown shrewd political skills managing massive federal budget, are reviving images Louisianan hot-head who gave party bad name government shutdown two years ago and who tends arm-flailing heated moments. One conservative leader said that he and his allies had reservations Livingston because he was obsessed trying keep social issues out budget process. The budget, he said, has been vehicle conservatives years add restrictions federal money abortion and other things you can't get Senate or presidential veto. If Livingston is challenger, I doubt that will cause rallying real conservatives Congress. Some moderates said they were prepared support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would be amenable Livingston. Still, she cautioned, I'm not Newt. But it's wrong not sit and seriously look our options. Ken Johnson, aide Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said that his boss was emblematic confusion broad base House Republicans. Billy has been loyal Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey, and he's still loyal them, he also wants hear what they have say committing them next election, Johnson said. Everyone is asking same question: Can we refocus message and re-energize our base re-aligning leadership? Salmon said his refusal support Gingrich no matter what was based Gingrich's track record one failed strategy another, including impeachment process and pork-laden budget. With challenge way, Gingrich has been trying show members that he is responsive their concerns. After election night which he portrayed Republicans victorious they lost seats, next day he took responsibility losses.

26,"America Online is verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involved talks said Sunday. The proposed deal is complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service more 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web and its software business. AOL would also enter joint marketing and development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's other business selling large corporations heavy-duty software needed serve Web pages and other Internet technologies many thousands users same time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, is valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced soon Monday morning. But executives involved talks cautioned Sunday night that some details remained be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy  on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At same time, however, it would end independent existence Netscape, Internet software maker once regarded most serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, has struggled last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator was runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology and then bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, its industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology caught Netscape's. Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoffs and started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape has focused mainly two businesses  advertising and transaction fees its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software corporations that are building their Internet sites which conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes it has expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involved negotiations said. Among large corporations, Sun's version Unix, Solaris, is most popular operating systems powerful computers that run Netscape's server software. The much smaller Netscape would be placed wing AOL and Sun Microsystems. The three companies had combined revenues more $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, comparison, had revenues more $14 billion. This deal would insure that fundamental elements Netscape survive bigger companies that can drive its technologies forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school and co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape and Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, if any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft is uncertain. It does appear support key theme Microsoft's defense  namely, that it operates fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, should have no direct effect current case. No matter how much alliances shift, it doesn't affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly and how it has used and abused its market power protect its monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, or just start Microsoft trial, according people close talks. Industry analysts suggest that companies may have been emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly perception that antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun and AOL. Still, executives involved talks said that timing proposed deal was unrelated antitrust trial. Nor should it, one person noted, be regarded single-minded attempt circle wagons Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, according one person close talks, plans keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser default choice its on-line service. One government's allegations antitrust suit is that Microsoft won out Netscape main browser AOL because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly bargaining chip. To win browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate Windows desktop, main screen more 90 percent personal computers sold today. Staying Microsoft's browser can be seen proof that AOL still regards placement Windows desktop crucial, well careful step avoid undermining one allegations government's case. For AOL, Netscape purchase would accelerate its evolution Internet. At present, its flagship on-line service is hybrid  its proprietary service, it has added gateway World Wide Web. In addition, consumers who do not subscribe AOL's dial-up service, it also has its Web site, aol.com, which attracts 24 million visitors month, according Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, market research firm. Its big Web site offers wide range information, entertainment, Internet chat and e-mail, leading example all-in-one sites that have become known portals. Netscape's Netcenter traffic has slipped bit recent months, 16 million visitors month, it, too, is major portal. Together, they should be huge player intensifying portal battle viewers and resulting advertising revenues. Yahoo is current leader portal sites more 25 million monthly visitors, while Microsoft's site attracts more 20 million month. Though known new-media company consumers, AOL is also interested boosting its electronic commerce business Netscape purchase. AOL has recently done work Eastman Kodak, American Greetings and other companies, not only promoting their products on-line subscribers also building Internet infrastructure software conduct electronic commerce. AOL notes projections recent one Forrester Research Inc., which predicted that worldwide Internet commerce could reach high $3.2 trillion 2003, or 5 percent global sales. Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could be strong partner AOL market Internet commerce software. Sun is corporate software company sales force several thousand. As it moves increasingly Internet technology, AOL should prove excellent partner Sun terms developing and using Sun's Java, Internet programming language. And while Netscape's browser no longer generates revenue its own, it is distribution channel Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely hands friendly company is strategic importance Sun, Microsoft owns alternative browser market. AOL is expected pay little, if any, premium Netscape's stock price Friday, executives close deal said, Netscape shares have more doubled last month. In last week alone, Netscape's stock has jumped $12, or nearly 45 percent, reports that it was discussing possible partnership AOL. The stock closed Friday $39.1875, $2.625. AOL's shares gained $1.50 Friday, closing $84.875. Envisioning thoroughly networked world which World Wide Web is limitless marketplace information, entertainment, products and services, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid out details its agreement buy Netscape Communications Corporation $4.2 billion. By moving quickly what companies have recently come see inevitable convergence technology and media, America Online hopes that it will secure solid lead battle already joined giants Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. transform greater part cyberspace vast virtual mall. Part that vision rests alliance Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated part deal. Sun not only brings cyber-savvy sales force effort but, more importantly, strong technology partner developing Netscape's industrial-strength software running Internet sites. Sun is indeed technology heavyweight. It owns Java programming language specially designed Internet applications, and Solaris, most popular commercial operating systems powerful computers that big corporations use serve Internet services World Wide Web, e-mail and retail transactions. It also manufactures highly respected line powerful computers based its microprocessor chips. But America Online  and big Internet players which it will compete  real potential gold mine lies further road, perhaps five years away, when people will venture line information or shopping not only personal computers inexpensive Internet appliances costing $200 each, or maybe included free part subscription service, just some cellular phones are now. Today, being wired remains comparatively elitist activity  estimated 25 percent American households had access Internet last year, and 5 percent households bought merchandise line. But executives America Online and Netscape hope that their deal will accelerate timetable day when Net is ubiquitous, when people will tap World Wide Web appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes or computers routinely they use telephone today. A new generation Internet devices be able deliver our service anywhere is key part what this deal is long run, said Stephen M. Case, 40, chairman America Online. For present, however, idea is make America Online, nation's leading online service, standard way get Internet, executives explained. Netscape, Internet pioneer, is crucial part that effort, they said. There is no assurance that this vision technological future will prove accurate or, if it does, that America Online-Netscape combination will lead way. Still, long-range game plan helps explain what brought America Online and Netscape together. And ability companies' executives sell that vision Netscape's whiz-kid programmers particular will determine whether merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif., is likely become prime target Silicon Valley headhunters. As is case any software company, Netscape's key asset is its talented programmers, and many these code hackers may be reluctant work America Online, which still has reputation middle-brow service catering online newcomers, known derisively newbies. Stock options and other financial incentives will be tailored try keep Netscape employees board. But these people want change world, and we've got be clear that joining America Online, Sun component, really is bigger opportunity us, said Marc Andreessen, 26-year-old cofounder Netscape who led team young programmers supercomputing center University Illinois Silicon Valley start Internet software company 1994. This ought be preeminent Internet company next decade, Andreessen declared, speaking cell phone streetcorner Palo Alto, Calif. For his part, Andreessen, Netscape executive vice president, will become Netscape's chief technology officer next three or four months, merger is completed. His new job America Online has not been determined, it is likely be chief technology officer combined company well, America Online executive said. Already, according one Netscape board member, Andreessen has delivered 12-page single-spaced memorandum Case, setting out his view technological road map new company should follow future, emphasizing opportunities electronic commerce environment which most people are linked Internet. Netscape, populated computing sophisticates, and America Online, known on-ramp Internet technologically challenged, seem corporate odd couple. But two companies, its executives explained, had been evolving each other more year. In telephone interview America Online's headquarters Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape enterprise that had morphed itself company dependent sales its software used browse World Wide Web  and Microsoft's cross-hairs  business that relied advertising and other revenues its popular Netcenter Web site and selling software corporations handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation was largely reaction Microsoft's competitive assault its browser business  central element government's antitrust suit Microsoft. Microsoft bundled its browser its industry-standard Windows operating system, and gave away browser free. The government alleges these steps were part pattern anticompetitive practices, while Microsoft maintains moves were intended mainly benefit consumers. Early this year, laying workers and suffering large loss last year, Netscape announced that it would also distribute its browser free. It seems have stabilized its business its new model. Netscape announced Tuesday that it earned $2.7 million revenues $162 million its fourth fiscal quarter, which ended September. Yet America Online has also changed last couple years, moving well its reputation online service beginners. It now has Internet chat service and runs its all-in-one site Web, known portal, which includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and online shopping. America Online has really changed closed online service novice users Internet media and technology company diverse set brands, Andreessen said. These two companies have been moving same direction, and fit is good one. America Online Inc. wants become next Microsoft two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another company  Internet media business and electronic commerce. With its proposed purchase Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, nation's largest dial-up online service more 14 million subscribers, hopes take significant step that ambitious goal. If $4 billion deal is completed  companies had not reached final agreement Monday night  AOL would acquire leading Internet brand and enlarge its wired audience absorbing millions who regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role premier Internet media company, said James F. Moore, president Geopartners Inc., consulting firm. America Online is assembling kind audience numbers that will convince people Internet is becoming mainstream media. In new media business, traditional media television or newspapers, eyeballs translate advertising revenue. But what really intrigues media executives and consumer marketers new media  news, entertainment and services rendered computer code  is that it is inherently two-way medium which people can interact tap key or click mouse button The interaction that advertisers and marketers want see, course, is buying. And it is potential exploiting instant, direct connection consumers that has fueled all recent optimism electronic commerce. Today, companies are selling everything books baby clothes Internet. Most companies have not progressed experimentation stage, there are handful encouraging success stories Amazon.com, on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business is analyzing trends cyberspace, projects that Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, or 5 percent all sales worldwide. AOL is forefront this convergence media and commerce converge, and integration reflected lineage its leaders. Steve Case, chairman, was once new-product manager Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, while Robert Pittman, president, is former MTV executive. Microsoft is also investing heavily new media and electronic commerce. It has online service, MSN, which competes AOL, well information-and commerce Web sites that focus travel, cars and real estate. It also owns Sidewalk, network local sites that list movies, restaurants and stores cities country including Seattle and New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service is half joint venture NBC. Microsoft is expected be formidable competitor media-and-commerce business. It has no shortage bright people and it has more money any rival. Besides deep pockets, Microsoft has built-in advantage any computer-based medium because its Windows operating system runs more 90 percent personal computers sold today. Its control Windows desktop gives it most valuable piece commercial real estate information age. In theory, least, owning that desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumers its online offerings  issue that is key government's antitrust suit Microsoft. But so far, Microsoft has started slowly fields Internet media and electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, it does not dominate these new markets, said Richard Shaffer, principal Technologic Partners, research firm. America Online recognizes that big opportunity is these emerging growth businesses electronic commerce instead trying take Microsoft head-on. Still, if Netscape deal is completed, AOL will also find itself software business way it has never been past. Netscape is known pioneer commercial development software used navigate World Wide Web. Microsoft saw browser software direct threat its industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively, bundling its browser its Windows and giving it away free  tactics that have been challenged government. But Netscape no longer generates revenues its browser, which it now also distributes free, sale heavy-duty software sold corporations. Much this software is used technological back office electronic commerce  used building Web sites and processing transactions. A surprising element proposed deal is that AOL intends hold Netscape's corporate software business instead selling it established software company. America Online just doesn't have credibility that market, observed Michael A. Cusumano, professor Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management. Executives close AOL explain decision need provide full-line offerings electronic commerce, corporate Web site computer screens consumers. But AOL has decided it needs help preserve and strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To do that, it has brought Sun Microsystems Inc. side deal, which has complicated transaction considerably. AOL, according executives close proposed deal, will Netscape, it will have joint marketing and development partnership Sun. As part deal, AOL will agree purchase $300 million worth Sun's computers its service, while Sun will apparently agree purchase sizeable amounts Netscape software, which Sun's sales force must sell. Still, AOL and Sun have longer-term objective well  one that promises place them more direct conflict Microsoft. For nearly year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, has been working closely AOL, according Sun executives. A former Harvard economics professor who taught Scott McNealy, Sun chairman, Raduchel has focused Sun's Internet programming technologies, called Java and Jini, which are seen potential threats Microsoft's dominance. By combining Sun's technology prowess AOL's powerful consumer brand, Sun executives say, there is potential kind end-run Microsoft's grip desktop computing. In its research laboratories, Sun has been working stripped-down network computer  simple-to-use information appliance, which could cost little $200 or be given away part subscription service. The concept is that AOL's Internet media and electronic commerce services could be delivered many more homes today because many people still shun expense and difficulty using personal computer. The appliance would be mainly receiver and screen, most computing power residing vast central computers serving information users request tapping few buttons. Sun's technological specialty is this kind centralized network computing. If long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialized  certainly three-to-five year bet, least  it could give companies boost and technological independence Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argued federal court Monday that proposed acquisition Netscape Communications Corp. America Online seriously undermined government's antitrust suit software giant. From legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls rug out government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president legal affairs, said Monday morning courthouse steps. The reasoning this assertion, Microsoft says, is that proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and larger software industry are healthy and vibrant  all illegal and anti-competitive practices alleged government's suit. But David Boies, government's lead attorney, said all that was irrelevant. Whatever deal ends being  if there ends being deal  is not going remove any obstacles that Microsoft has placed path competition this industry, he said. Michael Lacovara, Microsoft lawyer who was questioning government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested him trial Monday that proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed obtaining monopoly Internet browser software match one it apparently holds operating systems. After all, 22 percent Americans who use Internet reach it America Online. And present AOL uses Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, service's default choice. In exchange that, Microsoft places AOL advertisement and Internet link Windows 98. Lacovara asked witness whether, once AOL's service contract expires January, he would expect AOL continue distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It is not all clear me that AOL's incentive do this is changed this proposed merger Netscape. He noted that America Online officials had said their need be online services featured Windows forced them accept Microsoft terms  establishing Internet Explorer default choice. Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton question that lay his entire cross-examination witness  and Microsoft's larger assertion Monday proposed Netscape-AOL deal. Surely this combination, he asked, tells you something nature competition software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer was probably not one Lacovara had been after. To extent that this potential merger is result Microsoft's actions these exclusive contracts and other actions, he said, it is unfortunate see disappearance firm Netscape, brightest, newest star. Warren-Boulton's purpose stand government is establish that Microsoft does have monopoly operating-system software; more 90 percent world's computers use Microsoft operating system. That is foundation most government's case federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior monopolist that would be legal firm that faces healthy competition. Through repeated, circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried make case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share was ephemeral. The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, that Microsoft could be toppled its position any moment  point view company encourages its employees. On Friday and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are placing other operating systems market, and some software companies  principally Microsoft's greatest rivals  are writing software these new systems. But Warren-Boulton argued that existence these fringe competitors operating system market does not mean any way that Microsoft does not have monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made issue success Apple Computer Co. is having selling its new iMac computer. He entered evidence Apple news release issued last month showing, other things, that 12.5 percent people buying Apple's new iMac computer had previously owned Windows machine. Apple computers use different operating system, Mac-OS. The outcome Microsoft antitrust case may be long way off, one thing is already clear: This is first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, striking degree, are legal campaigns waged electronic messages. The human testimony pales next e-mail evidence. On stand or videotaped testimony, people being questioned shrug, mumble and forget. The e-mail is alive ideas and competitive zeal, punctuated profanity and exclamation points. The second week trial ended prosecutors being frustrated because lengthy cross-examination Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time government show several hours videotaped deposition Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. With new witness, executive Apple Computer Inc., taking stand Monday, it is uncertain when Gates tape will be played. The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft believe that tape will strengthen their case because it shows Gates saying he was not involved plans take what government alleges were illegal steps stifle competition Internet software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, Justice Department's trial lawyer, offers opportunity judge Gates' credibility. But Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes issue not because videotape because his taped remarks can be compared and contrasted e-mail he wrote and received. The e-mail record, government insists, shows Gates waist-deep plotting anti-competitive deals and bullying tactics that he denies or professes have never heard his taped deposition. If his machinations are central government's case, why not summon Gates trial? The government does not need put Gates stand, because we have his e-mail and memoranda, Stephen Houck, lawyer states, told court. The Microsoft legal team has months been preparing its e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that looks damaging is taken out context. I urge your honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, view considerable skepticism crazy quilt e-mail fragments that seem form core government's case. But Microsoft has also mounted e-mail counterattack, culled millions messages it obtained subpoena competitors pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual is present government witness internal e-mail his company and then pose declaration question. These interrogations have two refrains: Isn't it true your company does exactly what you are accusing Microsoft doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevailed not because it is predatory monopolist because its superior technology? Microsoft is accused trying prod companies stay out its way. So last week, example, Warden produced e-mail Stephen Case, chairman America Online, suggesting partnership Netscape Communications Corp. which companies would focus their respective strengths. That division labor, Case wrote, would be best way achieve goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described earlier e-mail beating Beast From Redmond that wants see us dead  reference Microsoft's headquarters Redmond, Wash. Printouts e-mail are just another form written communication. By 1920s, typewriters became common, typed memoranda started be used court cases. From 1950s 1980s, legal experts say, there was explosion documentation fueled new technologies electric typewriters, photocopying and fax machines, and then personal computers. And e-mail, they add, has played important role legal inquiries years, Iran-contra case 1980s when e-mail found Oliver North's computer proved crucial. But Microsoft case is result sweeping government antitrust investigation high-technology company where e-mail has supplanted telephone most common instrument communication. E-mail has just revolutionized investigations this kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While investigation, Microsoft has handed government estimated 30 million documents, mostly e-mail. In trial, two sides have submitted 3,000 exhibits, mainly e-mail. And their e-mail, people communicate more frankly and informally when writing letter or report  tap it out, punch button and it's gone cyberspace. But e-mail communication is documentary evidence, which legal cases provides rich, contemporaneous record what people were thinking and planning time. It can be sharp contrast formal oral testimony, so coached lawyers and crafted selective memory. The e-mail record certainly makes I-don't-recall line response harder sustain, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division who is now Brookings Institution. It can also be powerful ammunition pointing contradictions testimony. And that is what government will do attacking Gates' credibility his videotaped deposition, taken three days August. The government offered glimpse that strategy first day trial. It showed few brief clips point deposition when Gates was asked meeting June 21, 1995, which, government alleges, Microsoft offered divide browser market Netscape and make investment company, which is its chief rival that market. In taped deposition, Gates says he recalled being asked one his subordinates whether he thought it made sense invest Netscape. He said that he was asked it June 1995 meeting and replied, I didn't see that something that made sense. But e-mail May 31, 1995, Gates urged alliance Netscape. We could pay them money part deal, he wrote, buying piece them or something. The contradiction Gates' deposition and his e-mail, though, does not itself speak issue whether Microsoft made illegal offer Netscape. To be sure, it is what Microsoft  not what it said e-mail communications  that counts most. But once e-mail that looks bad gets record, you end doing what Microsoft's lawyers are going spend much this trial doing  trying explain it away, said Stephen Axinn, leading antitrust litigator firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider New York. America Online built itself most potent force cyberspace largely appealing families chatty teen-agers who want flirt online and adults looking easy way send electronic mail while checking weather and sports scores. Now, company has get serious if it is win hearts and minds corporate executives pin-stripe suits. Nearly lost complexity America Online's deal buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's announcement that it will enter entirely new market: working computer screen help companies open and operate online stores. Netscape already has created software that made it player providing support what is already known electronic commerce. But America Online now says it has ambitions offer much wider array software, consulting and services online merchants. Most companies that sell consumers realize that they need get e-commerce space, said America Online president Robert Pittman news conference Tuesday. We see major business offering them end-to-end solution. The market is big and growing bigger day. Forrester Research estimates that $325 million will be spent this year electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion services that range graphic design turn-key operation entire online stores. By 2002, Forrester estimates, combined market electronic commerce services and software should top $35 billion. E-commerce services are silver bullet that will enable companies be able take advantage true business opportunities Web, said Traci Gere, analyst International Data Corp. The market is growing very rapidly, it is very fragmented. Analysts say leader today e-commerce services is IBM, which has full line offerings sophisticated software products hand-holding consulting. Other competitors include well-known information technology consulting companies such Andersen Consulting, spin-off Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which runs computer systems big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting and consulting separately one umbrella. Software companies Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically little or no consulting help customers use them. There are also plenty new companies that have sprouted provide electronic commerce services. Some, Agency.Com and Organic Online, started basically advertising and design firms. Others, including U S Web and Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting. In fact, those two strains are blurring together, exemplified U S Web's pending merger CKS Group. America Online argues that its advantage this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability combine broad subscriber base 15 million customers Netscape software, hardware Sun Microsystems, which has joined America Online's venture electronic commerce engineering. This is first time anyone has put true end-to-end solution that starts silicon and ends audience, said Barry Schuler, America Online's president interactive services. We start Sun's line servers, then commerce tools build store, support services process orders and then deal online real estate that can drive traffic. Despite advantages Netscape and Sun bring, analysts say that America Online faces variety problems its new quest. Chief them is whether it can appear have consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers demand. AOL is not first company that comes my mind when it comes business-quality software, said Robert Chatham, senior analyst Forrester Research. Its decision keep Netscape separate unit and offer electronic commerce services partnership Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said. America Online doesn't look homogenous vendor, he added. It looks customers will have tangle menage trois AOL, Netscape and Sun. Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere International Data said, that they are capable offering highly specific customized services that big corporate clients demand. Telecommunications companies that try do things efficiently large number customers have not been able offer customized one-to-one relationships, she said. Pittman said that America Online had been driven e-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting sell their goods needed more help simply advertising online. We are finding people who are expert running bricks-and-mortar stores are limited their infrastructure, he said. They have online store, their square footage is too small. Even Netscape deal, America Online was moving provide some electronic commerce software and services. It has been rewriting software that lets companies open online stores be based universally accepted Internet standards rather specific computer language used only America Online. This new software, which now will be combined Netscape's online store services, will be available companies use America Online and Internet. Similarly, it has developed service that lets users create file their credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases retyping all that information each time. America Online is working offer it  fee  stores broader Internet. There is wide range services that are incorporated electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting help companies decide whether and how sell online hurting their traditional sale stores. There are all sorts computer systems be developed, ranging online stores themselves connecting those sites company's existing inventory and accounting systems. There are creative services that include graphic design, media buying, customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts. And there are operational services that involve actually maintaining big servers that users connect when they use online stores that display catalogs, take orders and process payments. America Online, Schuler said, will emphasize services that relate marketing rather back-office functions. We will consult how merchandise and sell online, he said. We understand consumer piece puzzle. Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic commerce services may simply be device sell its software and hardware. The challenge is prove that clients are getting best possible solution their business, said Robert Gett, chief executive Viant. If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, their answer is bit tainted. Netscape does have expanding force 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming. But they have been most competitive, Gett said, competing nuts-and-bolts projects rather more lucrative assignments develop and carry out full-fledged strategy Web. They say, `Who knows our software better Netscape?' Gett said. We help customers decide which platform is best them. But America Online argues that combined might it, Netscape and Sun is just what business needs. We always believed that commerce, that is buying goods and services, is huge revenue stream future, Schuler said. We have only seen tiniest tip iceberg. America Online built itself most potent force cyberspace largely appealing families chatty teen-agers who want flirt online and adults looking easy way send electronic mail while checking weather and sports scores.

Software companies Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically little or no consulting help customers use them. There are also plenty new companies that have sprouted provide electronic commerce services. Some, Agency.Com and Organic Online, started basically advertising and design firms. Others, including U S Web and Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting. In fact, those two strains are blurring together, exemplified U S Web's pending merger CKS Group. America Online argues that its advantage this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability combine broad subscriber base 15 million customers Netscape software, hardware Sun Microsystems, which has joined America Online's venture electronic commerce engineering. This is first time anyone has put true end-to-end solution that starts silicon and ends audience, said Barry Schuler, America Online's president interactive services. We start Sun's line servers, then commerce tools build store, support services process orders and then deal online real estate that can drive traffic. Despite advantages Netscape and Sun bring, analysts say that America Online faces variety problems its new quest. Chief them is whether it can appear have consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers demand. AOL is not first company that comes my mind when it comes business-quality software, said Robert Chatham, senior analyst Forrester Research. Its decision keep Netscape separate unit and offer electronic commerce services partnership Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said. America Online doesn't look homogenous vendor, he added. It looks customers will have tangle menage trois AOL, Netscape and Sun. Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere International Data said, that they are capable offering highly specific customized services that big corporate clients demand. Telecommunications companies that try do things efficiently large number customers have not been able offer customized one-to-one relationships, she said. Pittman said that America Online had been driven e-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting sell their goods needed more help simply advertising online. We are finding people who are expert running bricks-and-mortar stores are limited their infrastructure, he said. They have online store, their square footage is too small. Even Netscape deal, America Online was moving provide some electronic commerce software and services. It has been rewriting software that lets companies open online stores be based universally accepted Internet standards rather specific computer language used only America Online. This new software, which now will be combined Netscape's online store services, will be available companies use America Online and Internet. Similarly, it has developed service that lets users create file their credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases retyping all that information each time. America Online is working offer it  fee  stores broader Internet. There is wide range services that are incorporated electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting help companies decide whether and how sell online hurting their traditional sale stores. There are all sorts computer systems be developed, ranging online stores themselves connecting those sites company's existing inventory and accounting systems. America Online is verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involved talks said Sunday. The proposed deal is complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service more 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web and its software business. But part deal, AOL would also enter joint marketing and development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's other business selling large corporations heavy-duty software needed serve Web pages and other Internet technologies many thousands users same time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, is valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced soon Monday morning. But executives involved talks cautioned Sunday night that some details remained be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy  on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At same time, however, it would subsume Netscape, Internet software maker once regarded most serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, has struggled last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator was runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology and then bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, its industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free. Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoffs and started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape has focused mainly two businesses  advertising and transaction fees its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software corporations that are building their Internet sites which conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes it has expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involved negotiations said. Sun's version Unix, Solaris, is most popular operating systems large, powerful computers that run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure that fundamental elements Netscape survive bigger companies that can drive its technologies forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school and co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape and Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, if any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft is uncertain. It does appear support key theme Microsoft's defense  namely, that it operates fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, should have no direct effect current case. No matter how much alliances shift, it doesn't affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly and how it has used and abused its market power protect its monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, or just start Microsoft trial, according people close talks. Industry analysts suggest that companies may have been emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly perception that antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun and AOL. Stock prices vaulted record levels Monday, furthering recovery that recently two months ago seemed nearly unthinkable. I thought we were most serious correction 1990, I never thought or wrote that bull market was over, said Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. Now it seems all that is us. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, 9,374.27. The record is first July 17, when Dow closed 9,337.97. Since Aug. 31, when Dow stood 7,539.07 steep slide, blue-chip gauge has risen more 24 percent. For year, Dow is 18.54 percent and has chance rising more 20 percent fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before. Broader averages also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set record, rising 24.66 points, or 2.12 percent, 1,188.21. The Nasdaq composite index not reach new high posted biggest percentage gain Monday, rising 49.21 points, or 2.55 percent, 1,977.42. And Russell 2000 index smaller-company issues gained 3.86 points, or nearly 1 percent, 398.15. Monday's action was energized daily record number mergers and acquisitions valued $1 billion or more. The merger announcements not only prompted investors change estimates how much companies were worth also indicated coming declines outstanding shares stock. This may be supply-demand story, where demand stocks is rising and supply stock is reduced one company another merges, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. The flow money mutual funds is fairly strong, and there is pressure managers put that money work. Two deals seemed be catalysts broad swaths stocks. News that Bankers Trust may be close accepting $8.9 billion offer Deutsche Bank Germany heightened interest financial-services and bank stocks. And word that America Online may acquire Netscape Communications $4 billion stock powered Internet and other technology stocks loftier valuations. Among financial companies, J.P. Morgan gained 6 1/16, 115 11/16. American Express was 4 3/8, 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jumped 4 3/8, 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 3 9/16, 42}. Netscape was most active stock Monday, gaining 2}, 41 15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, 89\. Other Internet stocks also surged, and analysts said group, which has seen meteoric gains recent weeks, was ripe steep correction. Yahoo and Amazon.com became $200 stocks Monday. Yahoo rose 30 7/16, 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, 218. The performance Internet stocks is unsettling sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology shares also had very good day. IBM rose 7, 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, 119 3/16. And Intel closed 113 9/16, 1{. After Monday's big price moves, Wien said that according his calculations, stocks were 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, middle July market was 20 percent overvalued, he said. Nonetheless, market's recovery, which has been buttressed three cuts interest rates Federal Reserve Board, has left many longtime Wall Street hands grasping historical parallels. At this point we are new ground, said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his market research firm. At beginning year, I said my target Dow was 10,000 end 1998. If anyone had asked when market went what now looks corrective blip, I would have said my new target would have been 9,000. I am surprised 10,000 figure came back table this year. The New York Times said editorial Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort acquire Netscape and set partnership Sun Microsystems is reminder how rapidly corporate landscape can change fast-moving technical fields. But it does not lessen need Justice Department vigorously pursue its antitrust suit Microsoft, dominant player software. The department has presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly operating systems muscle rivals and partners so head competition other software realms. The Internet has risen so quickly information medium that only four years ago, his book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mentions it. In addition, only couple years ago America Online, world's biggest online service, was having so much trouble getting rid bugs system it was widely derided America On Hold. Now Microsoft has moved so aggressively Internet that Justice Department is accusing it predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed forward make deals other Internet players. In its antitrust suit Microsoft, federal government charges that company has illegally bundled its browser its Windows operating system smother Netscape's chances marketing its browser. Now corridors antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape has found new partner America Online and has no need protection government. But it could be easily argued that Microsoft has bludgeoned Netscape dissolution, forcing distress sale America Online. Nor is it clear that customers America Online will choose Netscape's browser vehicle buying and selling Internet. Even its newly musclebound form, America Online remains dependent Microsoft's good will favorable placement AOL icon main desktop screen. It may be that, years hence, America Online, Netscape and Sun will put together alternative means Internet telephone lines, cables or like. But that day, fairness requires Justice Department action insure that Microsoft not use its current position thwart consumer choice. Only when companies know they can get their products consumer will they have incentive innovate and turn Internet revolutionary medium it promises be.

27,"President Leonid Kuchma called Friday corrections Ukraine's program market reforms, pledged that reforms would continue. Kuchma not elaborate his comments group Ukrainian economists, saying only that changes were necessary because country's economic problems. Kuchma urged economists come recommendations national meeting economists November, Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine has suffered economic problems 1991 collapse Soviet Union and it has been especially hard hit financial crisis neighboring Russia, its main trading partner. The Russian crisis has hurt bilateral trade, caused Ukrainian currency fall and led withdrawal investors Ukraine. In recent months, Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms decree, prompting International Monetary Fund release first installment long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many reforms, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko was Washington this week consultations IMF officials. Yushchenko has warned that bank would not spend its dwindling reserves support hryvna currency, has avoided comments currency recent days. Kuchma met Friday Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior officials discuss ways stabilize hryvna. The government's press service said they focused possible ways keep hryvna 3.5 U.S. dollar end year. The hryvna has been trading 3.4 dollar recent days trading has been limited. There are wide expectations Ukraine that hryvna will fall further, and Ukrainians have been stocking food, clothing and household goods their fast-devaluing money. When world's finance ministers and central bankers gathered last year Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other containing  least moment  nasty financial brush fire Asia. In year's time, many predicted hallway chatter, troubles Thailand and Indonesia would look replay Mexico 1995  rough bump road world enjoying remarkable prosperity. Talk bad market calls. Twelve months later, same financial mandarins clog Washington their limousines and glide endless receptions annual meeting International Monetary Fund and World Bank, just everything that could have gone wrong world economy has: worst downturn Japan World War II, economic meltdown Russia, depression Indonesia that is plunging 100 million people poverty line, and deep fears what happens next Latin America. What makes this year's IMF meeting most remarkable, though, is that harshest criticisms are directed monetary fund itself, and, extension, U.S. Treasury, which is viewed power IMF. This year, place confident predictions, there are mutual recriminations. Arguments are breaking out whether true culprits were crony capitalists and weakened leaders Russian President Boris Yeltsin, or huge investors who poured money world's emerging markets reckless abandon mid-1990s and panicked twelve months. Whatever reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds billions dollars have fled economies four continents  seeking safest havens possible, United States  and money is not returning anytime soon. And subtext every seminar capital flows and every conclave nervous ministers will be some painfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? Or is world headed global recession? Fifty-three years ago IMF was created Bretton Woods conference which sought stabilize world economy and secure peace World War II. Now it is attack all sides, charged not only worsening bad situation misjudging economics, being politically tone-deaf some most volatile capitals world, Jakarta, Indonesia, Moscow. For first time, there are disturbing questions whether institution itself is still capable, financially or politically, containing kind economic contagion that caught world unaware. Once, IMF's critics were largely found Africa and South Asia, were fund was viewed arrogant; today they include Wall Street's biggest players and top officials most powerful economies Asia and Europe. Only few  including former Secretary State George Schultz and members Congress who are increasingly suspicious all international institutions  are talking scrapping IMF altogether. But almost everyone is talking creating new financial architecture that can do what old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires they leap globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other leaders, months silence, have edged debate, some cases wresting issue first time their finance ministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, is that 15 months financial turmoil are now threatening political stability. Such concerns have turned this year's meeting tumbled mass worries and groping short and long-term solutions. The Japanese, French, Southeast Asians are all arriving Washington different diagnoses what went wrong, and different solutions how set it right. The United States has its set plans, mix suggestions force more disclosure financial data countries world and impose more American-style financial standards and regulation. Meanwhile, ideological argument is breaking out whether world should slow long march more free and open markets  strategy pressed Clinton administration six years. Others argue that it is unwise start rebuilding hospital while patients are still operating tables. Last year standard answer that all us were given came this: `We have IMF and World Bank, and they know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said breakfast Washington other day, reflecting how crisis turned 30 years astounding growth his country overnight depression. Then they said everything that went wrong was our fault, he said. But now, now I think people know that much problem came outside, and we need something better. And IMF itself is beginning fight back, awkward role institution dominated Ph.D. economists who are unaccustomed being openly challenged. Every place you turn you read same story, that we came in, that we made things worse, said Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director fund, who was born Northern Rhodesia  now Zambia  and became chairman Massachusetts Institute Technology's economics department taking job that has now put him center financial storm. We frequently get blame, some it well-deserved, he said. But it is politically convenient governments world cry, `The IMF made us do it,' and pin their mistakes us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, more that we'd be effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, IMF's top official, slipped Jakarta private residence President Suharto and sat four-hour meeting tick off, line line, huge reforms Indonesia would have implement return tens billions dollars emergency aid. Two previous deals had collapsed when Suharto ignored fund's conditions, so Camdessus insisted that he strike deal directly Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader. It was meeting men who knew different worlds power politics: Suharto rose general central Java, and Camdessus had detonated mines Algeria French army entering French Treasury his way becoming head France's central bank. It was all there, senior IMF official recalled. He was told he had dismantle national airplane project, clove monopoly, all distribution monopolies. At one point, Camdessus looked impassive Suharto and said, You see what this means your family, reference their vast investments country's key industries. He said, `I called my children, and they all understand.' But months, that exchange Jakarta came symbolize IMF's twin troubles: Its inability understand and reckon national politics countries need radical reform, and its focus economic stabilization rather social costs its actions. Suharto had no intention fulfilling agreement. It was, one his former Cabinet members said, delaying move that was obvious everyone Camdessus. Perhaps one reason why IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is almost entirely composed Ph.D. economists. There are few officials deep experience international politics, much less complexities Javanese culture that were work Indonesia. Historically, experts politics and security have gravitated United Nations, development experts World Bank, and economists IMF  creating dangerous gaps crisis this one. As result, fund had only rudimentary understanding what would happen if its demands were met and all Indonesia's state monopolies were quickly dissolved. While that system lined pockets Suhartos and their friends, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staples country that stretches 3,000 miles thousands islands. To help balance budget, fund demanded quick end expensive subsidies that keep price food and gasoline artificially low. But that, combined huge currency devaluation that sparked crisis, resulted high prices and shortages that fueled riots that continue this day, millions Indonesians lose their jobs. The IMF  unintentionally, its officials insist  also sped Suharto's resignation, insisting elimination crony capitalism, code words removing Suharto family center economy. Ultimately, that may prove be Indonesia's salvation, if new government can contain rioting ethnic Chinese minority  whose money is desperately needed country's fast-shrinking economy. It is worth noting, Fischer said this week, that our programs Asia  Indonesia, Korea and Thailand  only took hold there was change government. Nonetheless, Indonesia experience has revived argument that IMF is so focused stabilizing banks and currencies, preventing capital flight and freeing markets, that it is blind social costs its actions. Among toughest critics has been its sister institution, World Bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty. You've seen tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official said recently. The bank has gone extraordinary lengths recent months differentiate its role that fund, and announce tripling aid poorest countries hit economic chaos. Even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined argument, warning speech Harvard recently that if globalization is succeed, it must succeed poor and rich alike. It must deliver rights no less riches. It must be harnessed cause not capital alone, development and prosperity poorest world. IMF officials say they are changing strategies when they see they are exacting too great social cost. It's very difficult formula get exactly right, Fischer said August, Russia was teetering and IMF was sending $4.8 billion aid that was rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline send right message markets and keep investors fleeing. But you need enough leeway keep people suffering more they otherwise would. In recent months, he noted, IMF has allowed more spending sustain subsidies basic goods longer periods Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere. There is new flexibility IMF senior Indonesian official concluded recently. It is lot better. A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admits that IMF has many failings, many them display this year. But it insists that world has gone global financial crises IMF once this century  and result was 1930s. I have no doubt situation year would have been much worse  greater devaluations, more defaults, more contagion, and greater trade dislocations  program agreed IMF and finance it has provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans and some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though Senate has overwhelmingly approved $18 billion contribution fund help it fight new crises, House defeated that measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope getting money, which will free nearly $100 billion contributions other nations waiting United States act, will come when House and Senate try resolve their budget differences conference committee next 10 days. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send message world that United States is turning its back one institution charged restoring economic stability. Everywhere else world, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one biggest problems IMF is that, contrary view Congress, it acts U.S. Treasury's lap dog. Ask Jakarta or Moscow, and response is same: The IMF never ventures far looking back approving nod its master. When United States weighs in, however, is when IMF is called rescue country deep trouble. Only then does IMF  and U.S. Treasury  have leverage extract commitments return billions aid. In theory, U.S. influence is limited: It has 18.5 percent vote fund. Germany, Japan, France and Britain have 5 percent each. But practice United States gets its way, exercising its influence scenes, interactions Fischer and Summers. The two met when Fischer was MIT faculty and Summers was graduate student taking one his classes, later becoming colleague MIT. Each served chief economist World Bank. It was Summers who was instrumental placing Fischer fund's no. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly. It's warm relationship, Fischer said this summer. Remember, this is job where you cannot turn outsiders advice  you can't call chief economist Wall Street firm, or many your academic friends, because so many issues are confidential. The Treasury's relations Camdessus are more strained he plays role world diplomat, traveling globe and trying coax political leaders. The tensions were obvious start Asia crisis. The fund made little secret its displeasure that United States was not offering direct aid Thailand, major U.S. ally, sign support and confidence. Mindful backlash Congress when Mexico was bailed out U.S. money, that was last thing Treasury planned do. Summers, turn, thought fund was not forcing Thais implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture. Within U.S. government there was other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt United States should do more Thailand, backed when Treasury asked if they would pony some aid out their budgets. There were other conflicts. When Japan used last IMF meeting propose setting $100 billion Asia Fund  one that would exclude United States and would probably offer aid much more relaxed conditions IMF does. Rubin called Camdessus breakfast one morning and told him that Japanese proposal would undercut IMF's authority. We've just had dispute Michel, Rubin reported his aides he returned his orange juice and croissant. One them shot back: And it's only 8 a.m. Camdessus backed Rubin's insistence and walked away money that Asia could have used. Japan says it will be back similar proposal this weekend, this time $30 billion fund. Camdessus has also rankled U.S. officials statements that amounted cheerleading reassure markets  sometimes face facts. In June, Russia its way collapse, Camdessus declared that contrary what markets and commentators are imagining slow collapse Russia's economy, this is not crisis. This is not major development. The bailouts Russia and South Korea were prime examples how Washington muscles IMF's turf soon major U.S. strategic interests are involved. Last Christmas, South Korea slipped days running out hard currency pay its debts December, it sent secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, work out rescue package. I didn't bother going IMF, Kim recalled recently. I called Summers' office Treasury my home Seoul, flew Washington and went directly there. I knew that was how this would get done. Within days Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most experienced veteran emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post undersecretary international affairs this month, shadow IMF staff's negotiations government Seoul. Fischer was displeased. To make negotiation effective, it has be clear who has authority do negotiating, he said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern was repeated this summer, when United States raced put together $17 billion package Russia. The IMF's staff Moscow declared that Russia needed no money all  it just needed enact policies that would restore confidence investors. The Americans and Germans came different conclusion. Soon after, U.S. officials gathered White House situation room consider what might happen Russia if ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and push IMF come emergency money. So fund began assembling last-ditch program prop country that had resisted its reform plans seven years. Camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning whether IMF should risk its scarce resources Russia. We had pull Michel along, senior Treasury official recalled. As it turned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while approach championed Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment that payment  $4.8 billion  was wasted, propping currency long enough, words one IMF official, let oligarchs get their money out country. Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments, let ruble devalue anyway, began printing money abandon and fired virtually every reformer his government  resulting collapse IMF agreements and indefinite suspension its aid program. Now, IMF and Capitol Hill, there are recriminations who lost Russia. Publicly, Fischer argues that there are no apologies owed what we attempted Russia. But some IMF officials complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod them, striking deal that fell apart weeks Russian parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away his commitments. Summers responds that United States took calculated risk because it was vastly better that Russia succeed not succeed. The Russian collapse touched new rounds economic contagion, investors fleeing Latin America, and triggering huge losses hedge funds Long Term Capital, Greenwich, Conn., investment firm that needed be rescued Wall Street powerhouses whose money it had invested. Russia was turning point, said Robert Hormats, vice chairman Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It made world realize that some countries can fail, if IMF and Treasury intercede. And that changed perception risk. Now, countries meet face future that IMF has warned could be very bleak, they need reverse those perceptions, or watch countries slowly starve lack capital. The emerging markets are calling controls short term investments. The French want stronger IMF. The Americans say answer is more disclosure, so that investors are better warned, and tougher regulation. These are nice, quiet meetings; everyone very polite, top U.S. official said earlier this week. Not this year. Ukraine's parliament Friday refused approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing state fund compensate people savings lost banks. Deputies voted 240-47 prepare revised version decree and debate it later month. They must consider decree Oct. 10, or else it automatically takes effect constitution. Leftist factions, which voted proposed legislation, said it would not fully guarantee return savings lost financial instability that has recently hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed establish would have accumulated money special National Bank account and repay people case bank they kept their savings went bankrupt or became insolvent. Although decree provided compensation deposits amounting only 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 current exchange rate), its authors said it would cover more 90 percent Ukrainians who keep their money banks. The measure was meant prevent mass withdrawals deposits that most Ukrainian banks have already experienced people, scared fall national currency and turmoil neighboring Russia, started stock food, clothing and household goods. Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn least 10 percent 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they deposited banks. Russia's new prime minister picked unusual way reassure nation Thursday. After two weeks deliberations he announced that he still had no plan rescue country its economic crisis. I want repeat once more  there is no program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It has be worked out. In most nations such statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov was seeking calm anxious public that was worried that Kremlin's cure could be worse disease. It is not if Russians do not have something be concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened meeting top aides try hammer out strategy overcoming economic woes. A main item agenda was plan drafted Yuri Maslyukov, Communist and government's senior policy maker economic issues. It not take long Maslyukov's plan hit street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, published it full Thursday morning. Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan calls greater state role economy, including controls hard currency. A new State Bank Reconstruction and Development would be established using nationalized assets failed commercial banks. Wages and pensions would be paid two months, and minimum wage would be indexed inflation. There would be huge tax cuts, combination that suggested that government was committed printing additional money. The exchange rate ruble would be set central bank, based changes inflation and balance payments. Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians would be able buy dollars exchanges country. It stipulates that hard currency could enter country only special authorization. Exporters would be required sell most their hard currency reserves. That is allusion currency controls that sent shock waves Russian public. Russians have come treat dollar second currency, and many people have squirreled away dollars hedge inflation. It is obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, commentator newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People won't give their dollars away. They will go black market if they need to. Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister who favors free markets, said plan was war dollar and predicted that it would lead shortage imports. As criticism grew, Primakov rushed distance himself talk currency controls. The rumors state's becoming monopolist inflow hard currency country is nonsense, he said, asserting that document published Kommersant Daily was just one six possible plans. Primakov may be opposed wildly unpopular currency controls. He may be worried that plan would would set panic buying dollars, further depressing ruble. Or he may simply be trying keep his distance Maslyukov's plan while Russia tries wrangle its next disbursement, $4.3 billion, International Monetary Fund. The particulars could be modified, many people maneuvering say they believe that it represents basic thrust government's thinking. Primakov has called greater state regulation and expansion money supply, two themes Maslyukov's plan. The plan also has many similarities plan presented government Gorbachev-era advisers. We think it is close being final document, said United Financial Group, Russian investment business. It is unclear how long Primakov can carry spelling out detailed strategy. The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, has argued that IMF should not provide further aid Primakov has taken tough measures build free market. Primakov has, however, sought turn that logic its head, arguing that his government's economic strategy will depend fund's willingness provide aid. His aim appears be pressure fund implying that it will be fund's fault if Russia is forced default its loans or take draconian measures home. Or Primakov put it Thursday, fund's money, Russia will have impose unpopular measures. Wall Street extended global stock selloff Thursday Dow industrials tumbling more 200 points second straight day.

A new survey Japan said confidence small- and medium-sized businesses economy plunged its worst level Bank Japan began quarterly samplings 1967. The United States is disappointed economic confusion new Russian government Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary State Madeleine Albright Friday, and she warned Russia dangers anti-Western policy. In her first comprehensive review U.S.-Russian relations Primakov was confirmed prime minister last month, Albright said Washington was deeply concerned Russia's direction and not think crisis there would soon abate. We have heard lot talk recent days printing new money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and restoring state management parts economy, she told U.S.-Russia Business Council Chicago. We can only wonder if some members Primakov's team understand basic arithmetic global economy. While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when he was foreign minister, pragmatist able cooperate key issues Washington, she had harsh words warning him. Our initial reaction some direction he's going has not been particularly positive, she said, adding, The question now is whether that cooperation can continue. The United States must keep its aid Russia is adjusting it promote building democracy and student exchanges well arms control, Albright said. Washington does not favor more direct aid. More big bailouts are not themselves going restore investor confidence Russia, she said. In long run, gap Russia's needs and its resources must be met not foreign bailouts foreign investment. Albright sharply criticized self-defeating many voices Russia who want shift emphasis Russia's interaction America and our allies one partnership one assertiveness, opposition and defiance its stake. Russia could not stand alone world, she said, and United States' ability help Russians help themselves will go being merely very, very difficult being absolutely impossible. At same time, she said, Washington would not assume worst, there are still plenty people Russia who will fight turning back clock. And she urged world  and American critics  be patient workings democratic process Russia and not start each day taking census reformers Kremlin, census that American officials themselves promoted President Boris Yeltsin dismissed previous government. While Moscow may continue oppose any NATO use force Serbian forces southern province Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepared act regardless. If Communist Party has its way  and it has been planning months  millions Russians will take streets Wednesday some biggest demonstrations years. But now that Communists or politicians Communist stamp approval are running country and its economy question is what marchers will be demonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers were easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seems shadow himself today, and his advisers are gone. The Communists, who have undergone sort resurgence playing discontent, are working hard cast themselves outsiders government that they help run  and keep focus protests Wednesday Yeltsin and his policies. Even that strategy may backfire, however, because discontent Yeltsin does not necessarily translate support his predecessors. An adviser Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, made headlines not long ago when he called new government bourgeois. The characterization was striking, because new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, was one Zyuganov's top choices post. The deputy prime minister charge economy, Yuri Maslyukov, is Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan, infamous central-planning program that helped bring Soviet Union ruin. We don't have slogans that are aimed government, first secretary Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, said recent interview. All slogans are aimed president and economic course country. Only president can fully be blamed course that has brought country this situation. Anger Russia's fate, and their own, is drawing some Russians back Soviet-style slogans and old-style hostility capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devoted most its front page Thursday what it said were results contest readers protest slogans. The entries ranged catchy kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker  study Constitution; exam is Oct. 7, to,  Imperialist! Help Russia return exported capital, and we will pay debts once. Russia has seen nothing approaching this sort economic chaos and despair 1993, when hyperinflation swept economy. There is no real way knowing whether latest travails will produce huge and ugly crowds or small, peaceful ones. A deputy editor and political analyst newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said situation was not that 1993, when Yeltsin sought, and won, popular mandate referendum. He used it dissolve Communist-dominated Parliament and increase his power. That led autumn showdown, shelling Parliament tanks and total defeat, time being, Yeltsin's legislative opponents. You can interpret this demonstration Communist mandate, I don't think they will act Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support Communists is its smallest level, maybe 20 percent. In survey 1,714 people that was released last week All-Russian Public Opinion Center said that nearly half population supported idea demonstrations Yeltsin, that barely one-tenth were likely participate any way. Nobody is interested any sort struggle, Yuri Levada, who heads center, said interview. This is mainly general expression great wave distrust authorities, mainly president. He's great scapegoat all our sins. There seems be little enthusiasm demonstrations any sort. Only few thousand people turned out Sunday fifth anniversary shelling Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph Communists. The Communist Party and Federation Independent Russian Unions, leftist organization that says it is main sponsor protests, predict that 9 million Russians will participate Wednesday. The government has vowed keep order resorting force. But it is concerned enough that it has summoned 11,000 police officers patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troops intervene if violence erupts. Protests 1993 have generally been tepid, deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, more or less practice runs, hinted similarly dampened marches this year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly any effort prohibit Russians buying foreign currencies, believing move would be bringing another Iron Curtain country, his spokesman said Friday. The president clearly understands that such ban would be clear violation our rights ... that would mean return Iron Curtain everyday life, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushin. The remarks came media reports government economic plan works that would prohibit Russians buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, and institute other strict economic controls, rolling back seven years reforms. Though government officials say such plan is only one six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be forced take unpopular measures rescue Russian economy if it does not receive next installment dlrs 22.6 billion loan International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew Washington Friday negotiations IMF dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials have said they want Russian government come sound economic program loan is given, and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting money supply printing rubles are not acceptable. But Primakov said that country's plan would be dependent IMF loan, not other way around. No short-term economic plan will be known another three weeks, long IMF is set make its decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily IMF loan, Kommersant newspaper said. Without loan, government would have engage major deficit spending. Calls Soviet-style controls  part plan drafted First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked press  have apparently created rift Cabinet. The plan drew heavy criticism Zadornov, and Gerashchenko called idea banning foreign currency sales mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market dropped 5 percent 38.8 Friday, trading was so light downward move meant little. The stock market has continued fall crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection was September, result collapse Russia's banking system, said Alexander Pochinok, head government's finance and credit department. Revenues totaled 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less expected. The government wants reverse this trend raising taxes oil and gas companies, idea is expected meet sharp resistance lower house Russia's parliament, which wants cut tax rates, Pochinok said. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that economic crisis would not bring end government's program privatizing state property. Privatization will be accomplished growth production, growth investment and growth production effectiveness renewal major funds, Primakov said meeting Western businessmen. We shall conduct privatization so that it serves interests people, state, and business, he said, according ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassured businessmen, members prime minister's consultive council foreign investment Russia, that government had no plans ban circulation U.S. dollars Russia. But, he said, government would take steps staunch flow dollars Russia. Responding media reports government economic plan that would prohibit Russians buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, Primakov said reports absolutely do not correspond reality, ITAR-Tass quoted him saying. He said there was no need regulate influx dollars Russia, government should take steps prevent what he called dollar drain. Russian companies stashed dlrs 2.5 billion country September alone, Interfax news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figures. Primakov said foreign investors are force that will help Russia minimize its losses current economic crisis. We are very much interested foreign investments, especially ones that go real production sector, Primakov said, according Interfax. We need continuous dialogue foreign investors, whom it will be difficult us overcome current difficulties. He said Russia wanted long-term investments. Foreign capital has been coming country short-term operations, Primakov said. This, he said, is not our liking or yours. Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, said Friday that government must act stem flow dollars Russia. Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov were Washington Saturday annual meeting International Monetary Fund, where they plan spell out measures Russia is taking bail out its finance system. Russia wants IMF release second dlrs 4.3 billion installment loan that was approved July, month country's economy crashed and government effectively defaulted its foreign loans. IMF officials have said they want Russian government come sound economic program installment is given, and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting money supply printing rubles are not acceptable. In season crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, failing cropsand rotating governments, maybe it is not ultimate insult. But nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regards well-written letter labor love, is buckling little this week, because it can no longer wish good health Baba Anya Omsk. The Post Office is broke. In 60 country's 89 statelike regions, more 1,000 mail cars have been sidetracked, many stuffed 18 tons letters, newspapers and parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuses carry more mail Post Office makes good some 210 million rubles old bills  $13 million today's dollars, or $35 million dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, which amounts one every four or five letters, was also suspended one Moscow's major airports this week, when Post Office coughed 5 million rubles old bills. A second airport is still demanding 3 million rubles past-due debts. So much mail is backed that post offices Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, areas that can be easily reached truck. Delivery schedules have fallen weeks, and perhaps months, behind. The situation is really extraordinary, said Vladimir Sherekhov, deputy chief mail service administration government's Communications Committee. We've never had anything this before. Maybe Post Office has been lucky. Extraordinary is rule elsewhere Russia. Until Friday, lower house Parliament was preparing sue government failure provide soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machine paper legislature's monumental downtown offices. It turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds cutting short their recess and returning address nation's economic crisis. Earlier week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping routes may close next month because half nation's icebreakers are disrepair and there is no money fix them. The oldest ships is so ancient that its nickname is Granny. Such anecdotal evidence that Russia is losing its wheels, one its old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, is everywhere. But oddly, real signs public distress are not particularly common, perhaps because system rarely seems shed part big postal system. If U.S. Postal Service is increasingly pipeline sweepstakes notices and bills, Russian Post Office still holds special place national conversation. Russians still write letters each other, frequently and fervently, and many remote regions get their news mail. Millions use mails ship canned goods and other provisions needy relatives and friends faraway areas, especially vital service winter. And last few years, Post Office has become vehicle growing mail-order trade books, clothes and other catalog items not readily available big cities. Exactly why all this has rumbled halt is some dispute. What is clear is that Post Office and Railway Ministry suffer what ails every Russian venture, private and public alike: Nobody pays his bills. The state Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed customers who believe railroads are honor-bound carry freight whether they are paid or not. The government has specified nearly 40 categories freight which railroads must carry next nothing. Among biggest deadbeats are power ministries  military and interior departments  which not pay Soviet times and feel little need pay now. It's psychology formed socialist period, said Tatiana Pashkova, deputy spokeswoman ministry, and same situation exists Post Office. We've been dispute very long time. Always we try understand their differences. But we can't carry cargo free. No kidding, says Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million rubles government agencies, and is barred raising rates though freight costs are outstripping revenues. Moreover, Post Office is also required government carry some forms mail, such pension checks, reduced rates. Officials state Communications Department say they also suspect ulterior motive railroads' actions: struggle dominate thriving mail-order business. Here's competition us and railroads delivery parcels, and I think decisions made railroads are mainly explained this competition, Sherekhov said. They blame us carrying some commercial cargoes instead mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said such commercial cargoes are indeed problem, only because railroads know that Post Office has already gotten cash transport packages. The railroads are still waiting their share that money, she said. In meantime, situation has come boil. In late September railroads cut mail service and out Moscow, effectively decapitating postal system and forcing officials draft fleet trucks move letters and out city. Hundreds empty and full rail cars have clogged some local yards point where moving cars position unloading has become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars were awaiting service one yard. And customers are getting angry. We've gotten all kinds complaints, said Viktor Salikov, deputy Communications Department's mail shipping center. People are coming us, searching mail that was sent weeks ago. ","In October 1998 amid worldwide financial crises, particular concern focused on Russia where economic meltdown was exacerbated by conflicted politics.President Yeltsin's latest Prime Minister, Primakov, was supported by Communists and when word leaked out that a Communist economic program was under consideration, Yeltsin denounced it.Primakov then assured the public that ""there is no program,"" suggesting that there would not be until the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came forth with a massive loan.IMF demanded a sound economic program before approving loan payment.Meanwhile neighboring Ukraine felt economic effects of the IMF-Primakov standoff.","Early October was fraught with economic woes as the International Monetary Fund prepared for its annual meeting.The IMF faces criticism for ignoring the social costs of its actions and being a pawn to Western demands.A small cut in US interest rates lowered markets worldwide.Russia, whose economy collapsed in August, was looking for a cure--possibly instituting Soviet-style measures.Key issues were stopping dollars from leaving the country and getting foreign investment end IMF loans.The postal service was in chaos, owing everyone.Demonstrations were expected.The Ukraine also struggled, especially to keep banks working.An IMF loan was on the way.","As world finance an banking representatives met in Washington, the economic news continued to be bleak.IMF officials had predicted had predicted a banner year, but stocks continued to slide worldwide and the DOW probably would record its worst third quarter loss in eight years.Russia and Ukraine have been especially hard hit by the crisis.In Russia, Prime Minister Primakov had no plan to solve the problem as the economy continued to Suffer.Postal service was threatened as the Post Office could not pay its bills.President Kuchma of Ukraine called for changes in market reform even as the Parliament turned down a bill to restore lost savings.","Fifteen months of world economic turmoil are threatening political stability.Lowering Federal Reserve interest rates is not countering the crisis.IMF is worried about the turndown in Japan, economic meltdown in Russia, depression in Indonesia, and anxiety about Latin America where investors are pulling out.IMF critics say it needs to understand national politics better and focus on social issues.Russia's economic confusion is upsetting the US.Russia is considering hard currency controls, demanding IMF loans and will not end government privatization.Ukraine, affected by Russia, is trying to save its fast-developing money system and keep investors."

","In early October 1998 Turkey moved 10,000 troops to the Syrian border accusing its neighbor of harboring Kurdish rebels and their leader Abdullah Ocalan.Syria denied the charges and blamed Turkey's belligerence on its military alliance with Israel.As the dispute threatened to ignite the whole volatile region, Egypt's President Mubarak launched a mediation effort soon joined by Iran and Jordan.Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon and Greece voiced support for Syria, but all called for a diplomatic solution.Israel did not take sides urging diplomatic talks and insisting that Israeli-Turkish military cooperation played no role in the crisis.","Tensions rose between Syria and Turkey over claims that Syria harbored Kurdish rebels, Turkey's growing ties with Israel, and Turkish dams on the Euphrates.Turkey sent 10,000 troops to the Syrian border.Israel declared non-involvement and limited border exercises.Egypt's President traveled to Syria and Turkey to mediate.Jordan urged the interests of the region and offered to mediate, as did Iran.Lebanon denied harboring Kurds, sided with Syria and blamed Israel for tensions, but urged peace.Greece said Turkey undermined stability but urged neighbors to get along.The Saudis, Yemen and Sudan supported Syria but urged peace.Assad was to visit Turkey.","Tensions between Syria and Turkey increased as Turkey sent 10,000 troops to its border with Syria.The dispute comes amid accusations by Turkey that Syria helping Kurdish rebels based in Syria.Kurdish rebels have been conducting cross border raids into Turkey in an effort to gain Kurdish autonomy in the region.Egyptian President Mubarek has been involved in shuttle diplomacy to the two states in an effort to defuse the situation and Iraq also has offered to mediate the dispute between the two countries.Although Israel has tried to demonstrate its neutrality, Lebanon has charged That Israel is the cause of the tensions between Syria and Turkey.","On October 1, Turkey moved 10,000 troops toward the Syrian border, and later sent jets along--possibly across--the border.Turkey warned Syria it could no longer tolerate Syria's sheltering Kurdish rebels in Syria and Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.Fighting with Kurdish rebels began in 1984.The Syrian denial included claims that Turkey was taking water and had a strategic alliance with Israel.Egypt, then Iran and Jordan, sought to defuse the situation and find a diplomatic solution for the two Muslim nations.Greece, predictably, chided Turkey, while Israel denied involvement and limited its military activities along the Syrian border."

United States maxi Sayonara looks set continue foreign domination line honors Australia's famous Sydney Hobart yacht race, which starts Saturday. Sayonara, raced American computer billionaire Larry Ellison, has only been beaten once it was launched 1995 and is aiming its second win 630 nautical mile bluewater classic. If 80-footer beats local boats home Hobart, it will be third time four years foreign yacht has finished first. New Zealand Endeavour trumped locals 1992, Sayonara won 1995 and German's Morning Glory set race record two days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds year. Sayonara's rivals are expected be last year's line honors winner Brindabella Sydney and new Australian maxi Wild Thing. The contest handicap honors appears more open, there are many who believe Sayonara could become sixth yacht do line honors and handicap double. Ellison believes unforeseen damage is only major barrier victory. She is much more modern boat Brindabella, if we don't break, we should beat Brindabella, we should beat anybody, Ellison said. If we hold together we should win race, question is if this boat comes and pays us favor we would just love knock record. Ellison says Sayonara can knock half day Morning Glory's record given right conditions. Brindabella's captain and owner George Snow believes new record is possible. I think front boats will be very close all way down, which will be great challenge, said Snow. We are well set up, we've got best crew we've ever had and I think boat is great shape, Snow added. The race is tipped start Saturday freshening north easters prospect showers and thunder storm southerly change 25-30 knots later day.

31,"Endeavour's astronauts connected first two building blocks international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It was first time that Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked be perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced two pieces came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (Russian Sunrise) using shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came hard part: stacking two giant cylinders cargo bay. The two station pieces are so big  77 feet tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pounds  that Currie and her crewmates had rely computerized vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. This was first time such blind docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inches directly Unity. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, and brief burst raised shuttle and thereby Unity enough docking mechanisms two station components snap together. The historical moment occurred South Pacific. The union  intended last station's 15-year or more lifetime  set stage spacewalk two astronauts Monday attach electrical connectors and cables two components. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer planned and gave six astronauts plenty time tasks. But everything occurred more or less when and how it was supposed to, aside piece space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach Zarya, six astronauts had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five miles orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, was Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never handled object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that was launched Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana called that two antennas module were still undeployed Russian flight controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be needed next summer, officials said. The only other problem was Zarya battery; astronauts took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future modules. It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connections two modules install handrails and other tools future crews. The joined modules will be released Endeavour once all work is completed. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be longer football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts. WASHINGTON  NASA and Russian Space Agency have agreed set aside last-minute Russian request launch international space station orbit closer Mir, officials announced Friday. While putting new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier transfer equipment and supplies old outpost new one, request came too late be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA was surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hours match orbits would have forced similar shifts subsequent assembly flights, and resulted potentially unfavorable sun angles solar-powered station, engineers said. We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent make these changes, Brinkley said news conference held Johnson Space Center Houston. It added technical complexity and risks mission that were not justified. The decision, which followed frank and candid discussions two partners, was not imposed United States, he said. The conclusions were mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides concluded that it not make sense. The Russians, struggling find money their space program their nation economic collapse, had said they wanted transfer thousands pounds newer equipment and scientific instruments Mir economy move. However, some critics questioned Russians' motives, wondering if requested orbital change was part plan delay decommissioning and destruction Mir, which Russians have agreed do next summer. The Russians have so little money that United States and other partners international station fear that money spent Mir will prevent Russia meeting its obligations new project. The Mir competes international space station very critical resources and funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider ideas salvaging Mir's research equipment use international space station, he said, only if it does not interfere assembling new station. The United States and 15 other nations plan begin building new station orbit next week when Russians launch module that will supply power and propulsion early stages five-year construction period.

But everything occurred more or less when and how it was supposed to, aside piece space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach Zarya, six astronauts had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five miles orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, was Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never handled object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that was launched Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana called that two antennas module were still undeployed Russian flight controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be needed next summer, officials said. The only other problem was Zarya battery; astronauts took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future modules. It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connections two modules install handrails and other tools future crews. The joined modules will be released Endeavour once all work is completed. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be longer football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts. Endeavour's astronauts connected first two building blocks international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It was first time that Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked be perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced moment two pieces came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (Russian Sunrise) using shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came hard part: stacking two giant cylinders cargo bay. The two station pieces are so big  77 feet tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pounds  that Currie and her crewmates had rely computerized vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. This was first time such blind docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inches directly Unity. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, and brief burst raised shuttle and thereby Unity enough docking mechanisms two station components snap together. The historical moment occurred South Pacific. It took several tries, however, Zarya and Unity be pulled tightly together. The docking ring them would not retract properly; Mission Control quickly traced problem attached robot arm and asked crew release its hold docked Zarya. That trick.

For second day row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour Friday liftoff NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go do this, said commander Robert Cabana. Amen, replied launch controller. Rain and cloudy skies were once again threat. But NASA was confident master alarm Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it went just 4{ minutes go countdown Thursday, forcing delay. NASA has only five minutes or less each day launch Endeavour order meet first space station part, which was put orbit two weeks ago Russians. The shuttle contains second station component. The master alarm blared and red lights flashed just shuttle was lift early Thursday. By time controllers traced problem momentary drop hydraulic pressure and decided press ahead, it was too late  they had missed cutoff second or two. Sure, it's frustrating, said Bill Readdy, shuttle program director and veteran shuttle commander. But we do things right. We do things book, and we're not going cut any corners if it means just shaving second or two. The six astronauts crawled out shuttle, and two threw their hands. Cabana held his thumb and index finger half-inch apart: We were that close. The problem was confined one Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. The pressure dropped just long enough trigger alarm, evidently because sensitive switch, then returned normal. NASA engineers spent day examining problem, found nothing wrong any systems and were confident it would not reoccur. Endeavour's flight is already year late because cash crunch Russia, one NASA's partners building international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA $600,000, mostly fuel and overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour is American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronauts will use shuttle robot arm capture Russian space station piece and attach it Unity. Then, two spacewalkers will hook all electrical connections and cables two cylinders, and attach handrails and tools future crews. Until alarm sounded, it looked though weather would be only problem. Rain and clouds moved Atlantic 1{ hours liftoff, drifted away minutes spare. Secretary State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries world had gathered drizzle see Endeavour and its crew off. Here we have 16 countries cooperating venture future, said Albright, who was expected back Friday's attempt. This is good investment. The planet's most daring construction job began Friday shuttle Endeavour carried orbit six astronauts and first U.S.-built part international space station that is expected cost more $100 billion. After last-minute alarm shuttle forced postponement early Thursday, launch went flawlessly 3:36 Friday morning, right schedule. The night sky was clear, and moon full. With roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly turned Florida coastline night day. More five minutes and 500 miles later, spaceship's main engines could still be seen distance, twinkling new star. On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts are locate Russian part already orbit, grasp it shuttle's robot arm and attach new U.S. module. Wielding tools hundreds miles Earth, working methodically cold void, astronauts will be starting five-year assembly that is likely make construction Pyramids and great cathedrals look child's play. Construction station, which will be research facility, will require estimated 160 space walks, which, safety reasons, will always be done two people. When complete, international space station, dominated solar power arrays, will cover area equal that two football fields. Modules interconnected laboratories and living quarters seven astronauts are form habitat equal that two 747 jetliners. The station's batteries alone, if lined up, would extend half-mile. The project entails high risk, because technical difficulty putting all this together unforgiving environment space, dangers inherent flying space shuttle construction site. The work is further complicated international politics and worries money. The Russians, whose participation partnership clinched post-Cold War deal five years ago, are now wild card. Moscow's economic and political woes have left Western officials unsure its ability and willingness come its share money and technology. At same time, station's costs are rising, and its critics scientists worry that its appetite money will consume their federal financing. The project's total cost is subject debate, most credible estimates now put price assembly and operation decade, station's estimated lifetime, $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayers are spend roughly $96 billion, and project's 15 foreign partners $14 billion. The station is intended be grand laboratory where, environment weightlessness, investigators can develop new materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remaining mysteries, part so that humans may someday know how adapt long space flight other worlds. Friday, any case, little was heard project praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control Houston radioed six astronauts shuttle went orbit. At Florida spaceport, Secretary State Madeleine Albright lauded launching team and new venture. That was truly, truly fantastic, she told team liftoff. And it was important, she added, have so many nations working together kinds issues that 21st century is going be concerned with. So my congratulations all you, secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday was Unity module, first U.S.-built station part. Small compared giants come three dozen shuttle flights assembly, unit is 18 feet long, weighs 13 tons and is serve connecting hub other modules. Saturday, one astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army, is have shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity payload bay and secure it Endeavour's docking system, moving unit horizontal vertical position. Then, Sunday, astronauts are rendezvous module known Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched orbit Kazakhstan Nov. 20. Financed United States built Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, is be kind tugboat embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion well communication and rendezvous abilities. When Endeavour's payload bay is 10 feet Zarya, Colonel Currie is reach out robot arm and pull Russian module position Unity. The mechanical arm has never moved anything so big. Zarya, while completely weightless space, has 21 tons mass. If mishandled, it can crush and kill. As Col. Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana Marine Corps, veteran three space flights, is nudge shuttle forward join two station pieces together. When mated special attachments, Zarya and Unity will form station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide out tips solar arrays. Starting Monday, pair space-walking astronauts are hook electrical connections and data cables units, attach antennas and install tools and handrails future visitors. The builders will be Col. Jerry Ross Air Force, 50, and Dr. James Newman, 42, physicist. Their series three space walks will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction goes outside, astronauts Endeavour will be busy making preparations enter new station connecting tunnel and docking system. Next Thursday, crew will enter embryonic station first time, installing portable fans and lights. Friday they will again enter, prepare arrival 1999 next major element, first one built and financed Russia. The other astronauts Endeavour are its pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow Marine Corps, and mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev Russian Space Agency. After separating new outpost, crew is bring Endeavour back Kennedy Space Center Dec. 15, mission length just shy 12 days. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director Washington international space station, said interview here that its overall costs were actually small individual Americans. Over its lifetime, she said, annual cost will equal that pizza and soft drink each nation's 96 million taxpayers. U.S. costs construction, she added, were $24 billion, and operations year 2012 were $10.4 billion, total $34.4 billion. Most experts agency consider this figure ridiculously low because it ignores many billions dollars spent early development work well cost numerous shuttle flights, which run $800 million apiece. Following series intricate maneuvers and skillful use space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts Sunday joined first two many segments that will form international space station. The shuttle and its crew six snared Russian-made Zarya control module chasing it Earth ever-closing orbits throughout day. Less hour rendezvous 240 miles Earth shortly 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army deftly used 50-foot arm grab 40,000-pound cylinder craft passed Russia and slowly pull it shuttle. Seeing Zarya close, Col. Robert Cabana Marines, shuttle commander, confirmed that two antennas had failed deploy module its launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. There were earlier indications that antennas, which will be used later station manually assist spacecraft dockings, had not extended. Currie took almost two hours painstakingly move Zarya American-made Unity docking port positioned Endeavour's cargo bay. When two pieces were aligned inches one another, Cabana fired small thruster rockets that raised shuttle, allowing modules clamp together. The two station pieces, together measuring 77 feet end end and having combined mass 70,000 pounds, are first 100 major components be united space next five years form orbiting outpost that would weigh almost million pounds and span area size two football fields. More 40 additional missions U.S. shuttles and Russian rockets will be used haul all components and other supplies orbit, and astronauts nations are spend almost 1,800 hours doing spacewalks assemble entire structure. The spece station is expected cost its partnership 16 nations more $40 billion just construct. Bringing pieces together is only first step mating them. A pair astronauts are make three spacewalks this week, first Monday, which they will hook electrical and communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails and perform other tasks get modules work one unit. The most difficult part Sunday's mating $240 million Zarya $300 million Unity was bringing them together shuttle caught Russian unit. Currie had use Canadian-built robot arm place Zarya top Unity being able see where pieces joined. Unity, raised Endeavour's cargo bay Saturday, is so large that it blocked Currie's view mating fixtures shuttle's windows. She used views remote cameras and computerized vision system built arm estimate relative positions two large segments. The computerized system examined markings modules, computed their relationship one another using marks and displayed results laptop computer. We've never done anything this before, Currie said flight, adding that she had practiced difficult maneuver more 100 times last two years. The flight Endeavour, which took Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, had gone according plan early Sunday, when mission control ordered shuttle change its orbit slightly avoid piece space debris. Air Force space debris trackers noted that shuttle was pass 1.6 miles spent stage American booster rocket launched last month. Although this was considered safe distance, shuttle controllers decided widen separation five miles extra precaution. Endeavour and its astronauts closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module that had be connected Unity chamber shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinders 240 miles Earth was considered most difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station pieces are so big  77 feet tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pounds  that Currie and her crewmates were going have rely computerized vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking had never been attempted before. Mission Control gave astronauts plenty time tasks. The main thing I've tried do last two years working this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning their final approach Zarya  Russian Sunrise  shuttle's six astronauts had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five miles orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, was Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity.

A last-minute alarm forced NASA halt Thursday's launching space shuttle Endeavour, mission start assembling international space station. Another attempt Endeavour and its crew six astronauts is scheduled Friday 3:36 a.m. This was first time three years, and 19 flights, that shuttle countdown had been stopped spaceship was fueled and crew craft and ready go. The uncommon delay prompted frowns and furrowed brows here, although officials stressed that it was entirely warranted. We want err conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director Kennedy Space Center, said news conference sudden halt countdown just 19 seconds liftoff. Everything had been going smoothly rare nighttime launching, set 3:58 Thursday morning. The weather, forecast be iffy, turned out be fine, and sky was alight nearly full moon. But length so-called launching window was, planned, unusually short  only 10 minutes. That brevity was result Endeavour's having rendezvous space-station part that Russia put orbit last month. The show-stopper arose four minutes liftoff when computer space shuttle set master alarm. Controllers studied data and discovered momentary pressure drop one hydraulic systems that control movements shuttle's engines and its rudder and other flight surfaces. Officials eventually decided that pressure drop was insignificant, and they resolved press ahead. But then it was too late: time had run out one procedures needed keep shuttle's fuel supercold. So countdown was aborted just 19 seconds blastoff. The six astronauts began emerge shuttle hour later and ultimately headed bed rest another attempt early Friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."
33,"Making their first collective decision monetary policy, 11 European nations launching common currency Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday surprise move that won market confidence. Ten 11 countries joining European economic union dropped their key interest rate 3 percent, Portugal making most significant plunge, 3.75 percent. Austria made smallest cut, 3.2 percent. The exception was Italy, which cut 4 3.5 percent. It is expected drop common rate time euro is launched. Unifying interest rate is critical step laying groundwork monetary union, and analysts generally expected rates settle level Germany's, 3.3 percent cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate levels had become contentious political issue center-left governments Germany and France pushing rate cuts help spur growth and combat unemployment, stuck 10.9 percent nations adopting euro. The head European Central Bank that will set monetary policy euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again Thursday suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets create jobs, and not pressure him cut rates. The remarks Brussels  cuts were made  gave no hint that rate drop was imminent, made clear his resistance political pressure was strong ever. So strong, fact, that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he had feared bank would delay decision. What had been feared was that, order prove its independence, ECB would go its analysis and would wait longer, which would have been nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, who runs German Bundesbank which ECB is modeled, hinted rate cut was designed boost confidence new currency, dampened global economic crises and Europe's worsening outlook. The coordinated rate cut could lead reduction current pessimism and reduction financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cuts seemed have desired impact. Frankfurt's main index closed 2.1 percent, while France's was 1.8 percent. The cuts also boosted markets Spain, Belgium, Italy and Britain, which is not nations launching euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're doing little bit prop euro economy.' But confidence has taken quite hit Europe recently, and I think further action ECB will be needed next year, maybe 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist Nomura. An economist Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, said cuts were timely. We are clearly headed slowdown, she said. Until recently, Europe's economies had held out relatively well damage Asia and Russia's economic crises and unstable financial markets. But just two days ago, Duisenberg painted bleakest picture Europe's economies, warning growth will likely slow 2.5 percent next year earlier expectations 3 percent. The rate cuts may help. By making it cheaper borrow money, rate cuts can lead more investment and new businesses, making it less worthwhile and inducing people spend. That expands economy. The 11 countries launching euro are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. Wim Duisenberg, head new European Central Bank, said interview published Wednesday that he won't step completing half his term earlier agreed. I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question. The answer is no, Duisenberg told Le Monde daily, which had asked him if he would step four years job. Duisenberg was named this spring head new European Central Bank, which will govern policies euro, new single currency which goes effect Jan. 1. France surprised its euro partners proposing its central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, last minute job Duisenberg was expected secure easily. Although he was elected easily, Duisenberg agreed step four years his eight year term although he has said no such gentleman's agreement exists. Duisenberg told Le Monde, newspaper that fervently has backed euro, that the introduction new currency is most significant step so far European unification. However, he said that he would see further political integration, especially area foreign tax and social policies. China made trading euro official Monday, announcing authorization European common currency's use trade and financial dealings starting Jan. 1. The expected announcement central People's Bank China and State Administration Foreign Exchange, carried official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized opening euro accounts. Financial institutions, enterprises and individuals China can accept and use euro economic, trade and financial exchanges 11 members European Union effective January 1, 1999, Xinhua reported. In addition, they can convert, use and open euro accounts, it said. Chinese officials have said government may convert proportion its dlrs 145 billion worth foreign exchange reserves euro currency's Jan. 1 debut. The 11 countries launching common currency are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. The annual inflation rate 11 nations that adopt euro their shared currency Jan. 1 fell 0.9 percent November, European Union's statistics agency reported Wednesday. The fall continued steady decline inflation euro-zone year. Annual inflation stood 1 percent October and 1.6 percent November 1997, according Eurostat's monthly report. In 15 nation EU whole, inflation fell 1 percent November compared 1.5 percent United States and 0.8 percent Japan. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg are set adopt euro common currency midnight New Year's Eve. The latest figures may hint trouble ahead euro-zone significant increases year Portugal and Ireland. With European Central Bank setting common interest rate whole bloc, some economists fear low rate designed boost core EU economies France and Germany may bring overheating smaller nations faster growth. There was good news Greece which was kept out euro-zone failing meet economic conditions joining, including low inflation. It's rate was 3.9 percent November 5 percent year before. Greece hops join euro-zone 2001. Denmark, Sweden and Britain decided stay out euro political reasons. Eurostat gave rates November 1998, November 1997 brackets: Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, 0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 (1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5). In his most candid remarks economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears be slowing 11 countries adopting EU common currency  or euro  Jan. 1. Despite area-wide survey that suggested moderation pace growth, Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue boost economy. He pointed also gradual improvement labor market conditions supporting growth, well interest-rate cuts 3.3 percent level euro-zone's lowest rate countries. Duisenberg, who spoke event London, said Dec. 1 and Dec. 22 meetings Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge outlook inflation and EU economy. The bank, which will set monetary policy currency bloc, has been pressure politicians keep interest rates low help boost growth and create jobs. While inflation is its lowest levels decades  just 1 percent euro-zone  unemployment 11 nations remains stubbornly high 10.9 percent. Struggling avoid being sidelined Continent-wide equities market promised Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities said Thursday that Paris stock exchange would join alliance London and Frankfurt that is seen precursor pan-European market. The Bourse Paris also announced that it would play host meeting Nov. 27 nine other European exchanges discuss steps and conditions needed create unifying and competitive pan-European equity market. The two announcements show how introduction currency, euro, is reshaping Europe's financial landscape, requiring Europeans think Continental rather national terms finance and business. And it suggested that exchange authorities Paris, ruffled announcement July strategic alliance London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse Frankfurt, had not only abandoned effort set rival market were also seeking gain initiative organizing Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, timing and technicalities French entry alliance. Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, Paris is joining this alliance creation January 1999 joint company. However, officials London and Frankfurt  who welcomed idea principle  declined say whether timing and arrangements were far advanced Strauss-Kahn implied. I'm afraid I can't confirm anything that, spokeswoman London Stock Exchange said. The appearances are well ahead reality this point, said American banker, who spoke condition anonymity. Not only that, notion Europe-wide exchange raises technical questions compatibility not just trading systems also regulations governing stock market operations countries that will use euro beginning January. That has led some analysts forecast that pan-European exchange could not be and running 2000. There are awful lot issues be resolved, American banker said. The euro is be introduced electronic trading equities, bonds and futures and intergovernmental transfers. Notes and coins  pocket money that shoppers and travelers will carry  will be introduced only 2002. Initially, currency will group 11 European nations euro zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece outside. With its concentration banking and trading, however, London is expected continue main market center. The prospect has heightened pressure consolidation exchanges. Stock market officials Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels have indicated they would be interested joining London-Frankfurt alliance, which will initially create single point liquidity trading British and German blue-chip issues. The London exchange estimates that pan-European stock exchange would group together companies market capitalization $5.5 trillion, compared $8.7 trillion New York Stock Exchange. The Paris Bourse, third largest European exchanges and last major holdout pan-European market, said that it had also invited officials exchanges Zurich and Stockholm attend Nov. 27 meeting. A spokeswoman said officials London Stock Exchange would be meeting. Also Thursday, New York Mercantile Exchange and International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledged that they were merger that would bring together two biggest energy futures markets. Discussions began July, and exchanges have formed working group study merger. They already cooperate development system intended coordinate after-hours electronic trading. Palm Pilot one hand, cellular phone other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 26, was juggling business calls halfway London and Paris. When his phone went dead high-speed Eurostar train pulled underwater tunnel that links England Continent, London-based French banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself. I definitely describe myself European, he said fluent English he perfected working Australian bank. I may get sentimental when they play Marseillaise, all practical things, I see myself citizen Europe. I lifestyle France, I don't make my living there. The year 1999 is official start-up date euro, common European currency that will unite 11 countries monetarily. But throughout Europe, different kind integration has already taken root. Routiers, who was spending day Paris meet his bank's French clients, is vanguard new generation Europeans who do not have brace themselves shock new year. Mobile, fluent several languages and aggressively non-nationalistic, they are already living kind borderless, cosmopolitan existence that single European currency is supposed advance. They do not share their parents' memories World War II or their parents' sense national identity. People worry when they hear talk common European defense policy because it suggests that end day, we have one government, said Kleon Papadopoulos, Greek banker based London. Countries are afraid lose their sovereignty, I don't see it bad thing. If government is good, stable and efficient, who cares if it is based Berlin or Athens? Papadopoulos, 36, who studied business United States and Britain, could serve model new Europeans. He works Swiss bank London, speaks Greek, English and French, and year has traveled, other places, Belgium, United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. Like hundreds thousands other Europeans, he chose London  and its busy financial markets  best place work. He said he does not feel if he lives England. He lives London, clubhouse financial Europe. And membership has its privileges. Papadopoulos lives fashionable Knightsbridge area, drives Porsche he bought Brussels, and works out fashionable gym Carleton Towers. I went London School Economics 1984, and only other `foreigners' I met were Middle East, he says. Now friends and co-workers are Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, Russian. You feel it everywhere. The streets are jammed foreigners. Not tourists  people who live and work here. Baby-boomers Europe describe themselves 1968 generation, weaned protest and social turmoil that convulsed European societies 30 years ago. Less dramatic equally significant was 1968 law guaranteeing freedom movement what were then six countries Common Market. A Frenchman could work Holland, Italian could work Germany permit. Back then some economists dourly predicted huge migrations, particularly unskilled laborers moving southern countries more prosperous north. Actually, huge industries steel shrank 1970s and '80s, so job opportunities working-class Europeans. There are 15 countries what is now European Union, only small percentage their citizens have moved other countries, according estimates prepared Eurostat. Those who do mostly find jobs service industry waiters, maids or garbage collectors. There are still legal barriers preventing most doctors, lawyers and academics finding work other countries. So far European Union has been most profitably put use white-collar business executives who eagerly followed career opportunities national borders, time zones and language barriers. Twenty-five years ago that kind mobility was preserve far smaller elite, top executives major companies or multinational corporations. Technology, high-speed trains ever-evolving apparatus business  lap-top computers, cell phones, fax machines  has made European mobility accessible mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs and students. Cable television, which allows Germans watch Italian game shows or Swedes watch French news programs, has spread Zeitgeist masses. This year Superga, Italian brand sports clothes and shoes, opened major advertising campaign series magazine ads that show fashionable young people saucily cavorting European leaders  leggy young woman pushes her bicycle steps Elysee Palace greet President Jacques Chirac, young man playfully sticks his tongue out window plane former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. This kind ad would not have been possible five or 10 years ago, said Aldo Cernuto, executive creative director Milan office Pirella Gottsche Lowe, international advertising agency. Now European unification is TV all time; it has seeped people's unconscious. Even people who do not care politics recognize faces Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. Ten years ago, very few people did. According European Union, Britain has twice many EU citizens France, it is not country highest concentration residents other European countries. According estimates based surveys prepared Eurostat, nearly third residents tiny Luxembourg, which has low unemployment and high standard living, are other European countries. Belgium, which has European Commission and NATO headquarters, is second, 5.4 percent. Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, one major European nation that has held joining euro, is widely viewed nerve center new cosmopolitanism, headquarters New Europeans  bankers and business executives drawn London's financial district, more flexible bureaucracy and universality English language. Perhaps just surprisingly, London also serves example another less obvious aspect European cosmopolitanism  breakdown certain social barriers. Studying abroad was once privilege reserved sons and daughters Europe's elite. Now European Union has 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that this year allowed 200,000 European university students  5 percent EU's entire university population  study other countries Union year, free. In last 20 years, business schools Europe have multiplied, and most offer U.S.-style MBA programs that teach American approach business. This too has allowed measure meritocracy creep European business. Juergen Schrempp, head Daimler, started car mechanic, noted Stephen Szabo, professor European Affairs Johns Hopkins University School International Studies Washington. That would have been unthinkable Germany 20 years ago. Social mobility, moreover, is fueled movement. When people transfer another country, they find it easier shed psychological or cultural trappings home. I could never have kind job I have had I stayed Paris, Routier explained. France is still very hierarchical. Bosses want know where you went school, what your father does. In London, none that matters long you make money. Many Britons still view their country weighed heavy class distinctions. For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor several Portuguese magazines Lisbon, seized opportunity study Vienna 14 years ago, and never looked back. He has lived all Europe, and is fluent Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. His father, car mechanic, had not traveled out Britain 1992. Smith said he could never have succeeded well had he stayed home. I didn't go public schools or Oxbridge, he explained. I'm not saying its impossible, it would have been much more difficult England. Yet Continental Europeans who flock London find themselves bypassing English society and joining cosmopolitan world where birth and breeding do not matter much. Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose work London escape sexism she encountered Continent. Mrs. Iliffe, who is Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and Italian, and met her Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while were attending University Bocconi business school Milan 1995. Like his wife, Iliffe speaks four languages and has lived and traveled all world. She works Eastern European desk British bank; he works major international consulting firm. Originally they planned work Italy, Mrs. Iliffe said prevailing attitude working women there made it impossible her find good job. I went job interviews Italian banks and they only asked me my husband's job, she said grimace. And they made it clear that they were afraid I would get pregnant and ask maternity leave. Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, professor Insead, prestigious international business school Fontainebleau, Paris, called Mrs. Iliffe's choices cherry-picking  choosing best deal herself. As he put it, If they cannot find what they want one country, they can pick and seek it elsewhere. Twenty-five years ago, Haspeslagh was pioneer when he same thing. A Belgian who studied business Harvard, he lives and teaches France and does consulting work all Europe, Sweden Czech Republic. The message his cell phone is three languages  French, Flemish and English. His students, generation him, see nothing exceptional his transnationalism. These Europeans form advance guard that is still relatively small numbers, experts say they carry disproportionate influence their societies. In Germany, example, it is business people who are pushing ahead change and pulling politicians them kicking and screaming, Szabo said. They are looking larger market and feel competitive pressures globalization. Politicians are responding domestic constituency. They are answering international one. In surprise move, nations adopting new European currency, euro, dropped key interest rates Thursday, effectively setting rate that will be adopted throughout euro zone Jan. 1.

In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said move reflected worsening outlook European economies, and wasn't capitulation political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine. It's not dramatic step. It wasn't response political pressure, Tietmeyer said, referring Germany's cut. The coordinated rate cut could lead reduction current pessimism and reduction financial market turbulence, he said. But Tietmeyer, head bank which ECB is modeled, promised that rate cut does not signal start volatile monetary policy. It's not shift Bundesbank's steady-hand policy, he said. Growth Europe has been hit Asian and Russian economic crises and turbulence international financial markets. Duisenberg has said growth euro area countries next year will be 2.5 percent, lower 3 percent predicted earlier. Two days new euro currency goes effect 11 European Union members, growing number Danes believe their country should take part, according poll published Tuesday. The survey Megaphone polling institute said 54 percent 1,009 people surveyed favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that. The remaining 10 percent were undecided. The poll, conducted Dec. 18-22, was broadcast TV2 channel. Denmark is one four EU countries staying out monetary union time being. After voters 1992 rejected Maastricht treaty that established system, Denmark won opt-out clauses. The treaty then was approved. Danish voters traditionally have been lukewarm supporters EU. Although many politicians support unified currency, they have been wary bringing issue voters again. A poll published last October showed 46 percent Danes favored single currency, while 44 percent were opposed. It would take another national referendum Denmark adopt new currency.

Saramago Thursday had planned leave Frankfurt, Germany,  where he was attending international book fair  his home Canary Islands. But Portuguese state radio said he was taken plane departure and driven back fair, where crowd wa waiting him.

The Nobel Prize years has been given writers world-views stretching bleak futility Samuel Beckett's works vivid epics Iceland's Halldor Laxness. The prize has gone occasionally writers who not work fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell. Last year's prize went Dario Fo, Italian playwright whose work combines gut-busting comedy acid social and political commentary. The 1996 winner was Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous. The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it considered its shortlist.

All prize announcements are Stockholm, peace prize which is given Oslo, Norway. All prizes are presented Dec. 10, anniversary Nobel's death. Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad United States Monday won Nobel Medicine Prize. They were given prize their discoveries nitric oxide signaling molecule cardiovascular system, according citiation Karolinska lnstitute. Furchgott is pharmacologist State University New York Brooklyn, Ignarro is University California-Los Angeles and Murad is University Texas Medical School Houston. The citation said it was senation that simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen burns ... could exert important functions organism.  Because research, we know today that nitric oxide acts signal molecule nervous system, weapon infections and regulator blood pressure. The prize amount 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally three. Last year, prize went Stanley B. Prusiner University California San Francisco his discovery prions, rogue proteins identified causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't known medical community, although list laureates contains few familiar names including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small paper carry large consequences. Among other well-known names receive prize is David Baltimore, although he shared prize 1975, long becoming one world's most visible AIDS researchers. Alan Cormack United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar names, what they won prize 1979 is term known most patients: computer-assisted tomography  or CAT scan. The medicine prize was second six Nobels be announced this year. Last Thursday, literature prize went Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, economics prize Wednesday and peace prize Friday. All announcements are Stockholm, peace prize which is given Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented Dec. 10, anniversary death Alfred Nobel, industrialist and inventor dynamite whose will established prizes. Jose Saramago became first writer Portuguese win Nobel Prize Literature Thursday. His personal delight was seconded burst public elation his homeland. Saramago, 75, and Portuguese said they were pleased Swedish Academy had finally acknowledged literary contribution Portugal, small country 10 million people bordering Spain Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula. It has taken all this century win Nobel Prize Portuguese language, Saramago said Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking interpreter. Saramago, soft-spoken man known his hard-edged and iconoclastic views, said he shared honor his country and he hoped winning prize would make Portugal and its language more visible and audible. I'm personally very happy myself. I'm also happy my country, he said Frankfurt Book Fair Germany where he was engulfed well-wishers offering roses. Back home, President Jorge Sampaio said award was cause great collective satisfaction. Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said award was all prize Portugal and Portuguese language which is spoken 180 million worldwide, mostly Brazil, also Portugal's five former colonies Africa. Saramago's controversial opinions and atheistic outlook have frequently clashed establishment and general public. Even day he won prize, Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano attacked Swedish Academy's choice, describing Saramago old-school communist who had substantially antireligious vision. Undersecretary State Sousa Lara was so upset one Saramago's novels 1992 that he withdrew his name Portugal's nominees European Literature Prize. At time, Lara said Saramago's 1991 novel O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo (The Gospel according Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's Roman Catholic religious convictions and divided country. The book describes Christ who, subject human desires, lives Mary Magdalene and tries back out his crucifixion. I have not come bring peace sword, said Saramago, atheist, time. He retreated disgust his Spanish wife, Pilar del Rio, his home Lanzarote Spain's Canary Islands. He has never courted kind fame offered literary prizes, and his bluntness can sometimes offend. I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go smiling, hugging people and trying make friends, he once said. A gaunt man wisps white hair, Saramago was born Azinhaga, small town Lisbon. From poor family, he never finished university continued study part-time while supporting himself metalworker. His first novel, published 1947  Terra do Pecado, or Country Sin  was tale peasants moral crisis. It sold badly won enough recognition propel him welder's shop literary magazine. But next 18 years, Saramago, communist who opposed 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, published only few travel and poetry books while he worked journalist. He returned fiction only Salazar's regime was toppled military uprising 1974. Since 1980s, he has been one Portugal's best-selling contemporary writers and his works have been translated more 20 languages. He first won critical acclaim abroad his 1982 historical fantasy Memorial do Convento, published English 1988 Baltasar and Blimunda. It is set Catholic-inspired inquisition and explores war individuals and organized religion, picking Saramago's recurring theme loner struggling authority. He is most frequently compared Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez because his prose is rooted recognizable settings same time tinged magical elements. The Nobel citation praised his work that parables sustained imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us apprehend elusory reality. Saramago remains prominent nonconformist his regular newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views are always inspired his deep concern his fellow man. Blindness, his most recent book be translated English, is unsettling allegory social meltdown inexplicable blindness sweeps society. This blindness isn't real blindness, it's blindness rationality, he said. We're rational beings we don't behave rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation world. In 1989 The History Siege Lisbon, Lisbon proofreader mischievously inserts word not text 12th century capture Portuguese capital Moors, thereby fictionally altering course European history stroke his pen. Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks. In his 1986 book, The Stone Raft, Iberian Peninsula snaps rest European continent and floats North Atlantic  apparently metaphorical search identity away standardizing nature European Union, which Portugal and Spain are enthusiastic members. Saramago will receive dlrs 978,000 prize Dec. 10 Stockholm. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who seems perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have won coveted honor 1978 had it not been strict deadline rules nominations. That prize was shared Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signing Camp David peace accords. However, five-member Norwegian awards committee also wanted honor Carter brokering pact, only be foiled their rules. The Nobel committee wanted give prize all three, said Geir Lundestad, current committee's nonvoting secretary, said Sunday. But Carter had not been nominated when deadline ran out. Nominations postmarked Feb. 1 are accepted that year's prize. The committee can add it nominations its first meeting year, early March. The Camp David accords were not signed Sept. 17, 1978, five weeks that year's peace prize was annouCkuld not give him prize, Norwegian committee recognized 1978 awards citation positive initiative taken President Jimmy Carter. Lundestad said committee, which works deep secrecy its five or six meetings year, tried find loophole rules, which are overseen Swedish Nobel Foundation. The Nobel Prizes were endowed Alfred Nobel, Swedish industrialist whose 355 inventions included dynamite. In his 1895 will, Nobel endowed prizes, and said peace prize should be picked Norwegian committee and rest Swedish institutions. Lundestad said committee turned Swedish Nobel Foundation advice Carter because it was question principle. Stig Ramel, Swede who was then director Nobel Foundation, advised breaking rules, Lundestad said telephone. Normally, committee refuses discuss candidates keeping strict policy secrecy which selection details are sealed 50 years. Lundestad made exception because Ramel revealed Carter dilemma his 1994 memoirs. Carter has repeatedly been nominated Nobel prize his consistent and wide-ranging peace efforts. He is also 139 candidates prize being announced Oslo Friday. However, early speculation leans more someone involved Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel mark 30th anniversary Soviet invasion his country, or human rights activist mark 50th anniversary U.N. Human Rights Charter. While committee wanted honor Carter and could not, hindsight some regretted prize other reasons. Four years Begin won prize, Israeli prime minister ordered invasion southern Lebanon which thousands civilians died. Kare Kristiansen, who served peace prize committee 1991 1994, once said that, had committee waited, Begin probably would not have won. There's room few more names 20th century honor roll writers, and one will be added this week when Swedish Academy announces latest Nobel Literature laureate. Who is chosen and why stimulates animated conversation readers well academics, critics and authors themselves. This year's winner  or, possibly, winners  will be announced Thursday, Academy disclosed Tuesday. The joke you hear is that it goes people you never heard of, said Ian Jack, editor London-based Granta literary magazine. But Nobel, awarded most every year 1901, also shines light, deservedly, wonderful writers few people have read, he added. His favorites include Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul, though he's convinced Naipaul probably won't win because his dark ... pessimistic and scathing portrayals post-colonial African culture. The academy keeps its deliberations secret. Who is considered seriously, who's nominated, isn't disclosed. A writer's nationality, terms prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, is supposed be irrelevant. Two can share prize, though last time that happened was 1974. Winners are expected personally receive it: awards are not given posthumously. Looking process afar, Harold Bloom, member American Academy Arts and Letters, said award committee has unsettling record selections that are nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.' The winners list is prestigious, he concedes, no means uniformly lustrous. Absolutely not! Outrageously not, he said telephone interview New York. They include all kinds fifth-raters. ... James Joyce never got one, heaven's sake. Neither Marcel Proust. Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author Blood Meridian; Philip Roth, author American Pastoral; and John Ashbery, best living poet. A review recent winners may foreshadow this year's laureate. Seven 10 were men  does that favor woman? Two three were poets  does that favor prose writer? Four 10 wrote English, and last three laureates are European. In comparison, only three Asian writers have ever won. Bei Dao is personal favorite mine, said Abe Harumasa, editor-in-chief Japanese literary magazine Bungei. The choice could be interpreted being motivated partly politics, given poet's association China's democracy movement, it's clear he's wonderful poet. Minoru Takeuchi, professor Chinese literature Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cited novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin worthy. The latter is known her portrayals struggles Chinese women. China, which translates and publishes works many Nobel winners, desperately wants its first laureate, he added. Spain's Nobel hopes are pinned Francisco Ayala, 92, winner this year's renowned Prince Asturias prize, said Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, author, university professor and secretary jury that selected Ayala. Other presumed Latin candidates are Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, member 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose works have been translated more 20 languages. For his part, Saramago, 75, said recent Associated Press interview that he's weary speculation that this year, once again, he might win. Let's not get that, he said. I just write. Jose Saramago, 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took literature relatively late life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him loyal readers Europe and vocal admirers United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize Literature Thursday Swedish Academy Stockholm. A tall, balding man whose large, tinted glasses give him mien severity, Saramago is first Portuguese-language writer  and one first card-carrying Communists  become Nobel Literature laureate. He is also fourth successive European win prize, Italy's Dario Fo 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska 1996 and Ireland's Seamus Heaney 1995. In its citation Thursday, Swedish Academy praised Saramago who parables sustained imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again apprehend elusory reality. Although Saramago discounts influence Latin American magical realism his work, his novels use supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical and irrational ways addressing complex questions faith and existence. Many his novels are set backdrop political or historical events, it is his unwavering concern individual fate that gives his fiction its distinctive voice and independent character. His best-known books, all published United States, are Baltasar and Blimunda, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, The Stone Raft and The History Siege Lisbon. His latest book available English, Blindness, which all one his characters mysteriously become blind, was described his symphonic new novel Andrew Miller The New York Times Book Review Sunday. There is no cynicism and there are no conclusions, just clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment things they are, quality can only honestly be termed wisdom, Miller, himself novelist, wrote. We should be grateful when it is handed us such generous measures. Saramago learned his award Thursday Frankfurt airport, where he was preparing fly home Madrid Lanzarote Canary Islands attending Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier this week, he participated round-table Portuguese writers topic, Why I am still Communist. He immediately returned fair where he was received cheers and bouquets roses. I am personally very happy myself, he said. I am also happy my country. Later he told news conference: The Portuguese language had wait 100 years this. There have be ways and means protecting language so that it does not become museum, is something that is alive. The writer's role is protect it and work it. The award was also celebrated Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio described it recognition Portuguese culture, while local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw it credit his party. As member our party, he noted solemnly, Saramago makes great contribution our ideals and struggle social change. The laureate's fiction, though, is never overtly political. Saramago, whose body work includes poetry, essays, plays and journal well 10 novels, is unusual having emerged major literary figure only age 60. His novels have been translated 30 languages, selling particularly well Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany. While he has not been well known United States, his novels have always been critically well received there. For all his late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed becoming writer. Born family rural laborers and raised Lisbon, he was forced poverty leave school while teen-ager and learn trade car mechanic. Yet he managed publish small novel age 25. Later, he found work Lisbon publishing company, oppressive and censorial atmosphere Salazar dictatorship discouraged him writing. It was only Portugal's April 1974 revolution that Saramago felt free find his voice. A member Portuguese Communist Party 1969, he served editor Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, 18-month period when left looked likely seize power Portugal. But anti-Communist backlash November 1975 forced him out newspaper and he began translating French texts Portuguese make ends meet. In late 1970s, he also turned novels, publishing three succession 1977, 1978 and 1980. But it was 1982, Baltasar and Blimunda (Memorial do Convento Portuguese), that he achieved his international breakthrough. This is rich, multifaceted and polysemous text that same time has historical, social and individual perspective, Swedish Academy noted Thursday. The insight and wealth imagination which it gives expression is characteristic Saramago's work whole. Set 18th-century Portugal Inquisition, book tells baroque efforts war veteran, Baltasar, and visionary, Blimunda, escape heavens flying machine powered human wills captured hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story takes place very real background tortuous construction massive Mafra Convent thousands men held grip Inquisition. When novel was published United States 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed it brilliant The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago is constantly present voice European skepticism, connoisseur ironies, Howe wrote. I think I hear his prose echoes Enlightenment sensibility, caustic and shrewd. In his next novel, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, which is also homage great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, who appears it ghost, Saramago sets his story early years Salazar dictatorship, tale romantic and sexual misadventures poet-physician. Writing The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called it rare, old-fashioned novel  once lyrical, symbolic and meditative. Saramago, whose sense literary freedom is evident his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use tenses, sought different form freedom The Stone Raft, where he imagines confusion unleashed when Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free rest Europe and begins drifting New World and threatens collide Azores. To delight Britons, Gibraltar is left behind. Unsurprisingly, bitter satire, The Gospel According Jesus Christ, proved controversial, God shown using innocently human Jesus create religion that has spawned violence and intolerance. When Lisbon jury picked book Portugal's entry 1992 European literary prize, country's conservative government vetoed choice blasphemous. It was then that Saramago decided leave his small, crowded apartment Lisbon relative solitude Lanzarote. The History Siege Lisbon, published United States last year, is whimsical tale set motion decision humble proofreader publishing house insert word not key passage standard history Portugal. With this lunatic creative act, Edmund White put it The New York Times Book Review, he totally derails national saga affirming that crusaders not fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon Moorish occupation. White ended his July 1997 review prescient remark. Word has it that Saramago is overdue Nobel Prize, he noted. No candidate has better claim lasting recognition this novelist. With recent publication Blindness United States, only Saramago's latest novel, Todos os Nomes, or All Names still awaits translation English. In tradition Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he has now embarked his journals. The fourth volume these Cadernos de Lanzarote was just published Lisbon. Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, worth equivalent $967,500 this year, ceremony Stockholm Dec. 10. Three American pharmacologists were awarded Nobel Prize Monday their surprising discoveries how natural production gas, nitric oxide, can mediate wide variety bodily actions. Those include widening blood vessels, helping regulate blood pressure, initiating erections, battling infections, preventing formation blood clots and acting signal molecule nervous system. The prize, physiology or medicine, went Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, State University New York Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, University California Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, University Texas Medical School Houston. The announcement significant phase discoveries two Monday's winners meeting 1986 elicited avalanche research activities many different laboratories world, said Nobel committee Karolinska Institute Stockholm, which makes awards. Its citation said that research had led new treatments treating heart and lung diseases, shock and impotence. Ignarro discovered principle that led use Viagra anti-impotency drug, said Dr. Sten Orrenius, professor toxicology Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide starts process which blood vessels penis widen produce erection. Nitric oxide, chemical relative anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, is better known common air pollutant formed when nitrogen burns, such automobile exhaust fumes. But scientists now know it is distributed widely body. The discoveries honored Monday were made largely 1980s time when scientists knew that bacteria produced nitric oxide not think it was important animals and humans. The award committee said that this was first discovery that gas can act signal molecule organism. The discovery was startling because nitric oxide is totally different any other known signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted nitrate and nitrite 10 seconds. Recipients Nobel Prize, including some who have lobbied it years, profess surprise learning their award. This year's winners were refreshingly candid. Furchgott said he had planned sleep late Monday, holiday, was awakened 5:30 his home Hewlett, N.Y. He said that he knew that previous Nobel prize winners had nominated him award, that he still was somewhat surprised receive it. I guess I had some good friends voting, Furchgott said. He said he could not get back sleep. Murad said he had pondered odds and thought that maybe I could win prize, if not now maybe couple years. He described award culmination career and said that when it happens, it's incredible. Ignarro was traveling Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, dean UCLA, said we actually anticipated this day four years now. The three 1998 winners never worked together, we talked lot shop talk meetings, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, president American Heart Association and head cardiology Mt. Sinai Hospital Manhattan, said that discovery nitric oxide and its function is one most important history cardiovascular medicine. Doctors have learned prize-winning research that heart disease, endothelium, or inner lining arteries, makes less nitric oxide. Drugs nitroglycerine, however, can help replenish stores nitric oxide. Now, drug companies are trying develop more powerful heart drugs based newer knowledge nitric oxide's role signal molecule. Researchers have also learned that nitric oxide produced endothelium rapidly spreads cell membranes underlying muscle cells arteries. Then it can shut muscle contractions arteries, thus widening them and reducing blood pressure. Inhalation nitric oxide gas has saved lives some people certain lung diseases, particularly infants who have developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating amount nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much can be lethal. Nitric oxide plays harmful role collapse circulatory system, or shock, resulting overwhelming microbial infections. Bacteria can release products that cause white blood cells release enormous amounts nitric oxide. As result, blood pressure drops. Scientists are trying develop drugs that can block production nitric oxide such infections. White blood cells also play role attacking cancerous cells. The gas can also induce type programmed cell death known apoptosis. Scientists are studying nitric oxide's effects immune system stop growth cancers. They are also exploring nitric oxide's possible role regulating body temperature. Doctors are measuring production nitric oxide lungs and intestines diagnose number ailments, including asthma and colitis, and are studying its role menstruation. Nitric oxide formed nerve cells spreads rapidly all directions activate cells vicinity and influence many functions, behavior and mobility intestinal tract. Nitric oxide is also being studied its role smell and memory. Nitric oxide's role is still unfolding; scientists have written thousands scientific papers it recent years and have started journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cited Furchgott performing 1980 ingenious experiment that showed that drug, acetylcholine, widened blood vessels only if inner layer, or endothelium, was intact. Furchgott concluded that blood vessels widen because endothelial cells produce signal molecule that he called EDRF, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relaxes smooth muscle cells blood vessels. Furchgott's findings led quest identify factor, citation said. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation not refer accident Furchgott's laboratory that played major role his discoveries. In 1995, Annual Review Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott wrote that May 5, 1978, first series planned experiments arteries rabbit, technician not follow directions correctly. The technician performed one step experiment instead he was supposed wash out drug used earlier phase experiment. Furchgott expected that arteries would contract. Instead, they relaxed. It was first time he had seen drugs study produce such reaction, and he used insight plan additional experiments. Furchgott omitted technician's name that paper and another 1996 Journal American Medical Association. On Monday, he said David Davidson was technician. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cited Ignarro concluding 1986, brilliant series analyses conducted independently Furchgott, that EDRF was identical nitric oxide. Furchgott said he and Ignarro made announcement same symposium 1986 Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn., papers were not published 1998. Murad was cited work conducted years while he worked University Virginia Charlottesville, Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories Illinois. Murad said he felt fortunate have heard Furchgott report his early work EDRF 1980. Murad showed that gas could regulate important cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart drugs led release nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In his early training Case Western Reserve University Cleveland, Murad worked laboratory Dr. Theodore Rall, who also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman University Texas Southwestern Dallas. Gilman said interview that he believed Rall, now retired and living Charlottesville, Va., was first scientist have trained two Nobel Prize winners. In addition, Rall worked Dr. Earl Sutherland, who also won Nobel Prize. In his early reseach years, Murad worked chemical known cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out be critical nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees referred early work dumping experiments because all they could do laboratory time was crudely add various hormones and agents slices tissue, cell cultures. It took years develop more refined techniques that led understanding nitric oxide's many roles body. But many years, most scientific community was skeptical ability free radical nitric oxide activate enzyme, Murad said 1996 when he and Furchgott shared Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes were created will Alfred Nobel, whose invention dynamite involved use nitroglycerine. The award committee noted odd twist this year's award. When Nobel developed chest pain heart disease, it said, he refused take nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it caused headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit relief chest pain. Nobel died 1896. The prize that three scientists will share is now worth $938,000. When Alfred Nobel wrote directions establishing literature prize his name, he chose unclear word and scratched out few letters. Questions prize have engaged and piqued literary world ever since. A new chapter mystery will be written Thursday, when Swedish Academy announces this year's winner world's most prestigious prize writers. The prize focuses intense media attention Swedish capital and clamor journalists generally drowns out question: Why does world care so much literary choices handful people quiet and remote country? Does Nobel Prize really recognize best? When asked that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said Look list prizewinners! The answer obscures much it clarifies. On one hand, Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers such Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders light, such Wislawa Szymborska. But prize arguably also has honored mediocre, heaping attention those who would have been more fairly served obscurity. Among them is winner first prize 1901, Sully Prudhomme. That choice was denounced Sweden's leading literary light, August Strindberg, and group Swedes sent letter Leo Tolstoy apologizing Academy's slight not choosing him. Arguments Academy's choices are inevitable, instructions they were given. Nobel's will says prize should recognize literature that works ideal direction. What, exactly, he meant ideal** is unclear and Academy's choices have reflected confusion. The Academy has chosen interpret word apply works ranging good-hearted charm Szymborska's poetry crushing hopelessness Samuel Beckett's writings. When Nobel wrote word ideal  Swedish idealisk**  he superimposed last couple letters previous one. Allen was so curious understand Nobel's thoughts that he engaged forensic expert try find out what earlier letters were. The expert succeeded  point. He found that first word Nobel wrote was idealirad, word that doesn't exist. Despite inclarity edges, Allen said he is confident that Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea that literature would be basis some kind progress. About this year's choice, he won't say more that: Academy is bound keep its deliberations secret. But observers love speculate who might win, who's shortlist prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). Names that freuqently come guessing include V.S. Naipaul, China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, and Jose Saramago Portugal. A day winning Nobel Prize literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted win award, it could just easily have gone many other Portuguese writers. I'm not only one who deserved it, said first Portuguese-language author obtain prestigious award. There have been other Portuguse authors, Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels Speaking packed press coference Madrid, Saramago joked how he heard he had won prize German air hostess Frankfurt airport he waited flight home Spain's Canary Islands. The news left 75-year-old writer no choice leave airport and return city's book fair meet press and public. At that moment I was moon and returning book fair only thing I was worried was that whole thing was error, said Saramago. Dismissing Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday his achievment, Saramago, known atheist, quipped that he was aware that Pope had been jury, I wouldn't have won prize. The Vatican is easily upset, said Saramago, I think that Vatican should keep its mind its prayers and leave people alone. Meanwhile Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled arrive Tuesday, delight Swedish Academy's award Saramago was reflected daily papers, country's three daily sports papers ample space event. The two leading dailies, Publico and Diario de Noticias, gave their entire front pages Saramago. Lisbon City Hall rushed out posters saying Congratulations Jose Saramago which were hung capital night. Saramago was born poor, illiterate family Azinhaga, small town Lisbon. He never finished university continued study part-time while supporting himself metalworker. Nothing my life would have led one think I'd win Nobel Prize, said Saramago. I wasn't born win Nobel. I didn't have my books I was 18. His first novel, published 1947  Terra do Pecado, or Country Sin  was tale peasants moral crisis. For next 18 years, Saramago, communist who opposed 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, published only few travel and poetry books while he worked journalist. He returned fiction only Salazar's regime was toppled military uprising 1974. Since 1980s, his works have been translated more 20 languages. Regarding future, Saramago said book he is currently working will be called The Cavern and deals modern version myth Plato and cave. Three American researchers Monday won Nobel Medicine Prize discovering how nitric oxide acts signal molecule cardiovascular system, breakthrough applications ranging hardening arteries impotence. The prestigious prize went Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott is pharmacologist State University New York Brooklyn, Ignarro is University California-Los Angeles and Murad is University Texas Medical School Houston. The citation Karolinska Institute said it was senation that simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen burns ... could exert important functions organism.  Because research, we know today that nitric oxide acts signal molecule nervous system, weapon infections and regulator blood pressure. Signal transmission gas that is produced one cell, penetrates membranes and regulates function another cell represents entirely new principle, citation said. Understanding how nitric oxide transmits signals has sparked research wide range new drugs, including those that can be used treatment heart problems, artherosclerosis, shock and impotence. The prize amount 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally three. Last year, prize went Stanley B. Prusiner University California San Francisco his discovery prions, rogue proteins identified causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't known medical community, although list laureates contains few familiar names including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small paper carry large consequences. Among other well-known names receive prize is David Baltimore, although he shared prize 1975, long becoming one world's most visible AIDS researchers. Alan Cormack United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar names, what they won prize 1979 is term known most patients: computer-assisted tomography  or CAT scan. The medicine prize was second six Nobels be announced this year. Last Thursday, literature prize went Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago.

It's worrisome, Erekat said. Previously, Palestinian leadership had said appointment was internal Israeli affair. Monday was Jewish holiday and there was no immediate Israeli comment summit prospects. However, Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, due meet Tuesday, was balking agreeing American-authored plan Israeli pullback West Bank. Erekat said Palestinians hope four-day summit, set begin Thursday U.S. capital, would mark end long meetings and start implementation accords. It depends Mr. Netanyahu.

Peace talks Syria and Israel broke more two years ago. Syria and previous Israeli government had reached informal agreement full withdrawal Golan Heights, which Israel captured Syria 1967. But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it was never formalized. Netanyahu has sent clear message all those who are deluding themselves  and betting Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand  give their illusions, paper said. Lebanon's peace talks Israel also have been suspended more two years pending progress Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri asking, Does Israeli government really want peace it is trying delude world? In front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, said The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiations (with Arabs) is tantamount disaster. Ariel Sharon, hawkish former general tipped be Israel's next foreign minister, said interview published Sunday that if he gets job, he won't shake hand Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land Palestinians, is being considered government's No. 2 post. In it, he would be pivotal figure reaching final peace settlement Palestinians. Even if I will be appointed foreign minister and run negotiations, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand, Sharon was quoted saying Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close making decision appointment. Netanyahu himself has been acting foreign minister post was vacated January David Levy, moderate who opposed Netanyahu's hardline negotiating strategy Palestinians. Sharon's appointment would signal toughening Israel's positions and could further strain relations Arab neighbors. Sharon is general who led Israel's 1982 invasion Lebanon, and former housing minister who strengthened Jewish settlement territories Israel captured Syria, Jordan and Egypt 1967 Mideast war. Sharon told Haaretz newspaper he would accept foreign minister's job if he were allowed act strengthen country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, hawkish former defense minister, be Israeli foreign minister Friday effort placate far right he moves closer turning more West Bank land Palestinians. With his appointment, Sharon, 70, ardent advocate Jewish settlements West Bank, is expected quell domestic opposition concessions that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared make peace summit conference Washington area next week. For months, Sharon, who is currently minister national infrastructures, has maintained that redeploying Israeli troops more additional 9 percent West Bank would be national disaster. In assuming role foreign minister, however, he would be forced abandon his public opposition Netanyahu's decision withdraw another 13 percent Palestinian territory  if he votes accord. Sharon will be drawn directly issue, Netanyahu has appointed him direct final status talks Palestinians, which would follow signing interim peace agreement. Last week Sharon told Israeli newspaper that, negotiations or not, he would never shake hand Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader, whom he has long disdained. Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists were divided their reactions, similar ways. Some professed be aghast, and some, Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian transportation minister, said they were willing forget history if Sharon's appointment provided Netanyahu political backbone sign deal. In Washington, White House and State Department officials pledged work closely Sharon and emphasized that personnel Israeli government are internal affair. Arik Sharon is most fitting person state Israel position foreign minister, Netanyahu said, using his nickname. He brings him rich experience, creativity, proven working ability and I think that he well knows wounds and damages war well fruits peace. Sharon has never hidden his beliefs, he continued, and his words have influenced way that redeployment will be carried out if not its extent. In nod Sharon, Netanyahu has decided new location nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent West Bank land. It was supposed be Judean desert Israel's eastern border, which Sharon argued would pose strategic security risk. Instead, it was decided Thursday that nature reserve would instead be slopes Hebron hills, much closer existing Jewish settlements. Many Israeli political observers believe that Netanyahu has eviscerated his right-wing opposition this appointment, signaling that he genuinely intends bring home peace agreement. Who is right wing now if Sharon is foreign ministry and negotiating Palestinians? asked Uzi Benziman, editorial board member newspaper Haaretz and author critical biography Sharon. It will be just settlers and some real hard-liners who don't comprise more 15 percent public opinion. So it's really quite intelligent move, suggesting that Netanyahu means business trying get agreement. But Palestinians took news hard, and read it differently. I think it's clear-cut message Bibi, Saeb Erekat, lead negotiator Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. I imagine people will try explain Netanyahu's intentions trying get support right. What he is trying do is make peace right wing expense making peace us. It means he wants continue path non-negotiations, because he wants continue be prime minister any cost. Sharon declined be interviewed Friday because his appointment must still be approved Cabinet Tuesday, approval that is expected. An aide, Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted position so that he could stem tide dangerous developments and contribute fighting risks facing Israel. A retired general who fought every Israeli war, Sharon, 70, is leading figure Likud Party who has done much battle Likud prime minister. At most recent party convention, he said that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand his left, which prime minister dismissed Friday comment made height political arguments. And when Netanyahu first formed his Cabinet 1996, fact that he not give Sharon senior position caused 11th-hour crisis swearing-in ceremony. Sharon retreated his family farm Negev, and David Levy, who had been named foreign minister, said he would not serve unless Sharon was given post. Netanyahu then created Cabinet job, minister infrastructures, especially Sharon. Levy resigned January lengthy power struggle prime minister, and then Netanyahu has been serving his foreign minister. Sharon, member old guard, has complicated political past, highlighted string military victories, and checkered, many, his indirect role, defense minister, Lebanese Christian Phalangist massacre unarmed civilians Sabra and Shatila refugee camps Lebanon 1982. Many Israelis, those who despise his politics, see him strong, experienced figure who knows his mind and who is capable being moderate when he has power. Friday afternoon, right-wing political establishment nearly universally applauded appointment. Uzi Landau, who is Likud hard-liner, said he was relieved hear confirmed what has been rumor weeks. I feel more safe negotiations if Minister Sharon is directly involved, said Landau, who heads Parliament's security and foreign affairs committee. Undoubtedly it will facilitate situation prime minister show right that Arik Sharon is identified program, so therefore they can live it. Right announcement was made, leaders National Religious Party, who had threatened bring government, changed their combative tone. They emerged mollified meetings Netanyahu late Thursday, saying they would leave government intact. Still, they would not connect their change heart nomination Sharon. Appointing Sharon is political step we very much, said Shaul Yahalom, minister transportation and leader National Religious Party. But it will have no effect how we see peace agreement. Our concern there is whether any 160 Jewish settlements are endangered. The appointment Sharon comes backdrop violence that has erupted this week. Friday, 19-year-old Israeli soldier, Michal Adato, was stabbed death Palestinian man she got bus her hometown, settlement Tomer Jordan Valley. Netanyahu reported that he had received sympathy note Arafat, who condemned attack. Also Friday, continuing clashes Palestinian youths and soldiers divided city Hebron, 32 Palestinians were lightly injured rubber bullets funeral Palestinian protester shot dead Thursday. After Netanyahu made announcement Friday, Israeli reporter introduced question stating that Netanyahu had diminished political threat right wing appointing Sharon. Are you willing sign that? Netanyahu said. I do not know that. I do know one thing that when you are dependent vote one or two people you can never know what will be. He was referring his razor-thin majority parliament  which some analysts perceive be his key motivator appointing Sharon. More anything else, this reflects political weakness Netanyahu, said Yaron Ezrahi, leading intellectual and critic prime minister. He has recognized that next redeployment is inevitable if he doesn't want be seen contributing wave political violence that would follow failure. But he doesn't have domestic political power carry out big decision his own. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days heading United States critical negotiations Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted Middle East peace effort appointment Ariel Sharon Israeli foreign minister. The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, long implacable foe Palestinians, is prepared make peace them and then sell it Israelis who are most opposed. Unfortunately, he is also capable wrecking entire peace effort. Much will depend whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, goal that has eluded other Israeli leaders. Like political typhoon, Sharon has roared Israeli life better three decades brilliant military commander, reckless defense minister and ardent conservative, leaving destruction his wake. He still bears burden his role massacre hundreds Palestinians Christian militiamen Lebanon 1982. An Israeli inquiry found he was indirectly responsible killings Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. As leader most conservative wing Likud party, Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet potentially decisive negotiations Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader. That will be fine if Sharon is willing play constructive role peace talks himself. But such behavior is not likely be first impulse man who has famously said he would never shake hands Arafat. Since Netanyahu has designated Sharon his chief negotiator, new foreign minister will soon have opportunity act more responsibly. The first order business when two sides get together next week Washington is wrap negotiations further withdrawal Israeli forces West Bank coupled security guarantees Palestinians. Sharon can show statesmanship helping Netanyahu close this deal, though it is opposed Israeli settlers whose cause Sharon has long championed. Success these talks would clear way last and most difficult negotiations permanent settlement, including shape and status Palestinian state and future Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hopes overcome shame Sabra and Shatila, he must become force peace Middle East.

Oct. 9, 1998: Netanyahu appoints him foreign minister, places him charge negotiations Palestinians, marking his return center Israeli politics and world political arena. Ariel Sharon's appointment Israeli foreign minister serves bullet mercy Middle East peace process, official Syrian newspaper said Saturday. In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced appointment disaster peace. Many Arabs know Sharon his role Israel's 1982 invasion Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking invasion found him indirectly responsible massacre hundreds Palestinian refugees pro-Israeli Christian Lebanese militiamen two Beirut camps. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister Friday, effectively putting hard-liner charge negotiating Israel's final borders Palestinians. The appointment is bullet mercy (peace) process, which has stopped all tracks, said Tishrin newspaper, which speaks Syrian government. It said Netanyahu has sent clear message all those who are deluding themselves thinking that Israel will change its anti-peace stand. Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke more two years ago. Syria and previous Israeli government had reached informal agreement full withdrawal Golan Heights, which Israel captured Syria 1967. But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed. Lebanon's peace talks Israel also have been suspended more two years pending progress Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri saying: Sharon's appointment makes Lebanon and most world states ask: Does Israeli government really want peace it is trying delude world? An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, said front-page comment: `The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiations (with Arabs) is tantamount disaster. The man is hero Arab defeats; he is firmest believer expansion land Israel and resolving Palestinian problem expense Jordan. He is liar, Baasiri wrote. The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said front-page comment: The history Ariel Sharon is known. He has called burning Beirut, annexing Golan, occupying (West) Bank and slaughtering and displacing Arabs everywhere. Ariel Sharon has law degree, and fancies himself farmer. But more three decades his role Israeli public life has been that unapologetic warrior, first battlefield and later bare-knuckled combat domestic partisan politics. With his blunt tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon 70 is his many critics here caricature right-wing intransigence. To his equally numerous admirers he is living symbol unrelenting dedication Israel's national survival. Still conveying physical vigor impressively expanding frame, he remains pugnacious fault. Both his friends and foes would agree that new foreign minister is not natural diplomat. A Zionist underground operative teen-ager and infantry commander wounded 1948 war independence, Sharon has fought, and fought memorably, virtually every major military engagement his country's history. He commanded legendary armored division that crossed and seized control Sinai 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He returned active service three-month retirement lead Israel's badly outgunned armored divisions victory, again Sinai, war 1973. As defense minister 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion Lebanon, defying international condemnation unrelenting artillery assaults Beirut neighborhoods and Palestinian refugee camps believed Israeli high command be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts. To some, Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion will forever be associated massacres Lebanese Christian Phalangists, allies Israelis, reported 460 unarmed Palestinians Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. In official inquiry Jerusalem and subsequent libel trial he brought New York, Sharon was seen have effectively refuted charges that he knew and condoned Phalangists' attacks beforehand. But government investigating commission held that his failure prevent killings constituted grounds his dismissal Defense Ministry. Since 1982 invasion, Israel has been mired unpopular open-ended occupation southern Lebanon, operation constant casualties young inductees which Sharon is still blamed. To many Israelis, however, Lebanese incursion was ultimately risk worth taking, it succeeded crushing PLO militarily and driving its forces far Israel's borders. The PLO's defeat Sharon's hands Lebanon led eventually its renunciation armed warfare Israel and embrace peace negotiation process which Sharon Foreign Minister will now be responsible. In civilian life he proved savvy political operator he was military strategist, helping break Labor's hold Knesset and making himself indispensable binding force successive fractious Likud coalitions. His investiture foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment 21 years. He previously held agriculture and defense portfolios Prime Minister Menachem Begin, trade and housing Yitzhak Shamir's government, and national infrastructure  essentially, settlements support directorate  administration Benjamin Netanyahu. As key member inner cabinet Begin's first government, Sharon began construction and systematic expansion new Israeli housing developments throughout West Bank, Gaza Strip and Galilee area territories occupied Israel 1967, policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remains his signal domestic political achievement. At 70, Sharon remains one great polarizing fixtures Israeli political life. An acerbic critic other leading soldier-politician his generation, Yitzhak Rabin, Sharon attacked Oslo peace accords terrible and dangerous and condemned Rabin's negotiating partner, Yasser Arafat, war criminal. He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussions return internationally demilitarized Golan Heights Syria. A secular Jew manner typical his generation native-born Israelis, Sharon became outspoken and effective defender new Orthodox Jewish settlements predominantly Palestinian areas West Bank, cementing his position bridge traditional secular right and new militant religious factions Likud coalition. ","Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank.Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East.Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon.Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process.Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand.","Prior to his appointment as foreign minister by Israeli Prime Minister Natanyahu in 1998, seasoned warrior Ariel Sharon announced that if appointed, he would not shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine.When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace.Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort.Arab commentary deemed the appointment ""tantamount to disaster"" and ""the bullet of mercy"" to the peace process.Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt.","Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process.His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right.Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics.He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion.Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a ""bullet of mercy"" for the Middle East peace process.","In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator.Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians.His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a ""disaster"" in the Lebanese press and ""a bullet of mercy to the peace process"" in a Syrian paper."

Hodler said group four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved promising votes payment. He declined identify them. The four agents try make living out this, he said. I missed chance be rich man. Some agents do following: they say, `I can offer this or that number votes.' The price wold be dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million number votes, bloc. Hodler added that agents then charge city winning bid something dlrs 3 million dlrs 5 millon.

IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself Hodler's allegations. The only official spokeman IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard, Samaranch said. All other comments are personal comments. They are not official comments. Hodler's allegations, made group reporters, came IOC continued investigations alleged financial misconduct Salt Lake City group which won bid 2002 games.

I know what happened I don't want disclose it. I can't imagine that Sydney is different others, he said. Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean. Hodler contested argument current Salt Lake organizing committee that it was not directly involved controversial scholarship program and that onus was former bid chief Thomas Welch. Yesterday lawyer Salt Lake City said, `Everything had been done Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not true. The controversy centers scholarships  including tuition assistance and athlete training programs  paid relatives IOC members Salt Lake bid committee. From 1991 1995, committee  direction Welch  spent nearly dlrs 400,000 scholarships 13 individuals  six them relatives IOC members, mostly Africa.

But he sought distance himself allegations making distinction actions bidding committee and current organizing committee. Presumably (Hodler's) remarks are related actions bid commitee 1995, Joklik said. The organizing committee certainly has people integrity and ethical standards that would stand any investigation. The facts were early 1990s when bid committee was operating. U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky described controversy disruptive Salt Lake's image and preparations games. It doesn't do us any good all, he said. I hope we see speedy resolution Judge Mbaye's review. I hope it will be footnote. I hope it never becomes chapter. Salt Lake organizers, 10th graf pvs LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP)  IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch Sunday promised expel any members if they are found guilty accepting bribes.

Hodler said he believed four agents  including one IOC member  had been involved vote-buying 10 years. He said he thought 5 7 percent IOC members  currently numbering 115  were open bribery. Samaranch denied that he muzzled Hodler, Swiss official claimed earlier Sunday. He said he had told all members executive board that only himself and director general Francois Carrad could speak media. This is not first time I do this, he said.

Saying if we have clean, we will clean, Juan Antonio Samaranch responded Sunday allegations corruption Olympic bidding process declaring that IOC members who were found have accepted bribes candidate cities could be expelled. It is serious problem we have us, Samaranch, president International Olympic Committee, said hastily arranged news conference tumultuous meeting IOC executive board. Samaranch compared current climate Soviet boycott 1984 Olympics Los Angeles and sprinter Ben Johnson's expulsion 1988 Olympics Seoul, South Korea. Those were difficult moments, Samaranch said. Now we are facing another difficult moment, I'm sure we will solve this problem. Samaranch expressed surprise allegations made IOC executive board member Marc Hodler Switzerland that agents were offering sell I.O.C. members' votes payments bidding cities. Hodler, second most senior member IOC, said Saturday that he knew four agents, including one IOC member, who engaged such activities. Hodler said he believed that 5 7 percent IOC membership, which currently numbers 115, asked some sort compensation their vote. He has called new electoral process, which executive board or some other select IOC group would decide which cities become Olympic hosts instead full IOC membership. Samaranch agreed Sunday that time had come explore change. The system we have now is very complicated, very slow and very expensive, he said. Hodler, former head International Ski Federation, also claimed that Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free vans influence votes Italian resort Sestriere hold 1997 world skiing championships. Fiat denied claims Saturday, Sunday Howard Peterson, former senior American delegate ski federation, said he had been offered cars two Fiat executives. The issue vote-buying came fore Lausanne because recent disclosure scholarship payments made six relatives IOC members Salt Lake City officials their successful bid play host 2002 Winter Games. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has said payments, which amounted slightly less $400,000, came privately financed fund that was started 1991. And Intermountain Health Care, Utah's largest health care provider, confirmed Sunday that it gave free surgical services least two people associated IOC 1994. A special commission headed IOC vice president Dick Pound was appointed Friday investigate issue and has met Salt Lake officials. Sunday, Frank Joklik, president Salt Lake Organizing Committee, issued public apology Olympic family and citizens Utah embarrassment caused scholarships program. Samaranch Sunday ruled out taking Games Salt Lake City. He said, If necessary we will expel members if this ad hoc commission thinks these members are guilty. Pound said his commission was already satisfied Salt Lake City won 2002 Games merit bid. He also said that his commission would expand its inquiry Salt Lake City bid only if it was presented evidence and not simply rumors corruption other bids. On Saturday, Hodler had suggested bidding teams Atlanta and Nagano, Japan, that won 1996 Summer Olympics and 1998 Winter Olympics had not run clean campaigns. Billy Payne, who presided Atlanta's bid, and Makoto Kobayashi, general secretary Nagano organizing committee, denied those claims. Asked whether he regretted his statements Sunday, Hodler said, Not all and later said that cities have been victims and not villains. Pound said there had been concern IOC some time agents. There always have been lobbyists, he said. In recent years, especially Olympics coming every two years, there seems be professional class being created. Hodler, when pressed further comment this afternoon Olympic headquarters, initially covered his mouth hands and then said, Muzzle imposed president. Hodler, 80, is one only four IOC members life membership because he was appointed age limits were imposed 1966. Asked if he might resign he said, I'm not going resign, I might be expelled. But 78-year-old Samaranch said he had great respect Hodler and no intention asking his resignation or pushing his expulsion. Moving quickly tackle escalating corruption scandal, IOC leaders questioned Salt Lake City officials Friday first ever investigation alleged vote-buying Olympic city. Acting unusual speed, International Olympic Committee set special investigative panel that immediately summoned organizers 2002 Salt Lake Games address bribery allegations. The chief investigator refused rule out possibility taking games away Salt Lake City  though that scenario is considered highly unlikely. Frank Joklik, president Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appeared IOC panel 90 minutes Friday night. Both sides declined comment talks, saying inquiry was still process. Earlier, Joklik met IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and other top officials provide information and documents case. The controversy centers payment nearly dlrs 400,000 scholarships relatives IOC members Salt Lake bid committee which won right stage 2002 games. Senior IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said scholarship fund  described humanitarian aid Salt Lake officials  amounted bribe sway votes 1995 election. It's most serious case alleged ethical misconduct investigated IOC former U.S. member Robert Helmick was accused conflict interest 1991. Helmick eventually resigned IOC member and president U.S. Olympic Committee. This is first time IOC has ever investigated possible bribery bidding cities, previous rumors and allegations corruption other Olympic votes. The executive board takes this matter very seriously, said Dick Pound, IOC vice president heading Salt Lake inquiry. Despite many requests made or evidence support rumors that have been floating around, we have never had anything come forward. Specific allegations have now been made. The executive board acted very quickly investigate. Also investigative panel are IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, executive board members Jacques Rogge and Thomas Bach, and IOC director general Francois Carrard. Pound said panel would investigate allegations that there may or may not have been payments benefit members IOC or their families connected Salt Lake City bid. Pound, Canadian lawyer, said there was no deadline completion investigation said it was possible inquiry could be wrapped this weekend. Pound declined speculate what  if any  sanctions could be taken Salt Lake not rule out moving games elsewhere. We're not going make any conclusions or any speculations what we may decide we know what facts are, he said. Moving games would be unprecedented and, just three years go, would be logistical nightmare. Most facilities needed games Salt Lake already are built. John Krimsky, deputy secretary general U.S. Olympic Committee, discounted any possibility games being moved. There is no chance all, absolutely none my mind, he said. I can't be stronger saying I don't consider it possibility whatsoever games being withdrawn Salt Lake City.  Salt Lake organizers have denied that bid committee's dlrs 500,000 project was effort buy key IOC members' support four years votes 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake lost '98 race Nagano, Japan, 1991, when program was begun. It won landslide vote Sion, Switzerland, 2002 Games 1995 balloting. From 1991 1995, bid committee  direction former president Thomas Welch  spent nearly dlrs 400,000 scholarships 13 individuals  six them relatives IOC members, mostly Africa. Olympic rules prohibit bidding cities giving IOC members or their relatives any presents or benefits exceeding value dlrs 150. I've already stated I do not regard what was done bribe, Joklik said Friday. I recognize there have been perceptions contrary that. I regret those perceptions, I don't feel they are justified. Joklik was chairman bid committee time, No. 2 official Welch. Welch resigned last year president organizing committee being accused domestic violence his wife. He currently serves SLOC consultant. The organizing committee certainly has people integrity and ethical standards that would stand any investigation, Joklik said. The facts were early 1990s when bid committee was operating. Among those identified receiving scholarship funds was Sonia Essomba, daughter late Rene Essomba Cameroon. The elder Essomba, prominent surgeon, was secretary general National Olympic Committees Africa. A top IOC official Saturday made explosive allegations widespread Olympic corruption, saying agents demand dlrs 1 million deliver votes selection host cities. Marc Hodler, senior member International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices bid campaigns games 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. Hodler said group four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved promising votes payment. He declined identify them. The four agents try make living out this, he said. I missed chance be rich man. Some agents do following: they say, `I can offer this or that number votes.' The price would be dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million number votes, bloc. Hodler added that agents then charge city winning bid something dlrs 3 million dlrs 5 millon. Hodler, 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who boasts that no city has ever won Olympic Games his help. No one can prove that, Hodler said. It could be possible. He said he believed agents had been buying and selling votes 10 years. There are four agents we know, he said. One is IOC member. He promises he will give enough votes so (the biddding city) can win. Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, I know so many times. There is good chance it is always case. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself Hodler's allegations. The only official spokeman IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard, Samaranch said. All other comments are personal comments. They are not official comments. Hodler's allegations, made group reporters, came IOC continued investigations alleged financial misconduct Salt Lake City group which won bid 2002 games. Hodler has described bribe dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set Salt Lake which benefited relatives six IOC members. It also came former minister charge Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid revealed he was asked offer bribes exchange votes. Bruce Baird, former New South Wales minister, said he refused. Asked whether Atlanta's victory vote 1996 games was clean, Hodler said, Certainly not. John Krimsky, deputy secretary general U.S. Olympic Committee, disputed Hodler's assertion. There is no basis charges Atlanta this point, Krimsky said. All these issues should be put IOC review commission. Hodler also leveled allegations head Athens bid which lost Atlanta 1996 vote. Hodler said he overheard Spyros Metaxa, wealthy Greek businessman who led bid, describing Samaranch and IOC members stupid imposing restrictions bidding process. For me there is only one purpose: winning games, Hodler quoted Metaxa saying. I will do is necessary win games  if it costs me dlrs 100,000, dlrs 10 million or dlrs 100 million. Hodler said he didn't know any misconduct Athens' successful bid 2004 games. Asked whether Sydney's election 2000 games was clean, Hodler said, I would be surprised. I know what happened I don't want disclose it. I can't imagine that Sydney is different others, he said. Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean. The committee which won 1998 games Nagano certainly had do things which are not legitimate, Hodler said. Hodler contested argument current Salt Lake organizing committee that it was not directly involved controversial scholarship program and that onus was former bid chief Thomas Welch. Yesterday lawyer Salt Lake City said, `Everything had been done Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not true. The controversy centers scholarships  including tuition assistance and athlete training programs  paid relatives IOC members Salt Lake bid committee. From 1991 1995, committee  direction Welch  spent nearly dlrs 400,000 scholarships 13 individuals  six them relatives IOC members, mostly Africa. The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman bid committee time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was also high official bid committee. Hodler said blame shud be those who put pressure Salt Lake offer scholarship funds. Nobody blames Salt Lake City, he said. We blame those voters who can be bought  not Salt Lake City. They were victim. We should thank them not paying money  only scholarships. Joklik Saturday denied any payment votes. I don't know what agents are, he said. The senior Olympic official who leveled stunning allegations corruption IOC said Sunday he had been muzzled president Juan Antonio Samaranch and might be throw out organization. Marc Hodler, Swiss member IOC executive board, said Samaranch had ordered him keep quiet. He said he was told not appear scheduled routine news conference.

45,"Whether or not talks Exxon and Mobil lead merger or some other business combination, America's economic history is already being rewritten. In energy businesses financial services, telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and technology have made unthinkable combinations practical, necessary. Oil companies Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have additional pressure, one unthinkable less two decades ago. Crude oil prices have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year levels, adjusted inflation, not seen first oil embargo 25 years ago. As such, oil companies, having spent years cutting their costs, are desperate further savings order continue operating profitably such low prices. Exxon and Mobil are two largest, strongest competitors emerge nation's most famous antitrust case, 1911 breakup John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Now they face Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger either them. They will also confront British Petroleum PLC made far more potent United States its agreement this summer buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 billion. Industry executives say further deals this scale are inevitable. Executives companies not return calls Thursday comment talks, and it was unclear Thursday night what outcome might be. But if Exxon and Mobil agree become one, antitrust regulators are likely be cautious putting back together much what they long ago broke apart. Even so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency combining giant energy companies would do more lower costs more concentrated ownership gas stations and refineries would do raise them. The ultimate beneficiary all this will be consumer, said Daniel Yergin, chairman Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, costs could prove heaviest energy industry employees. Analysts say that 80,000 global employees Exxon, based Irving, Texas, and more 40,000 Mobil, Fairfax, Va., thousands would be likely lose their jobs. Exxon, Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, Lucio A. Noto, have chief executives who have been preoccupied humbling accommodations that low oil prices have made necessary. Oil companies were everybody's favorite targets trust-busting era early this century and again Arab oil embargoes 1970s. Now they seem especially vulnerable demand weakens much world, especially economically troubled Asia, weighing further already depressed prices. They're pitiful, helpless giants, said Ronald Chernow, author Titan, biography John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, these giants are compelled continue cutting costs and spreading risks their huge, expensive international projects that are needed develop oil reserves needed next century. Mobil, $58.4 billion sales last year, might seem large enough undertake anything. But competing rights develop huge natural gas fields Turkmenistan, former Soviet republic, Mobil was unable match Shell's offer build pipeline $1 billion or more. Oil companies have decided that they cannot count rebound oil prices revive their fortunes any time soon. Earlier this month, Energy Department predicted that collapse Asian demand would continue depress oil prices nearly decade, and much $5.50 barrel year 2000. And Thursday, Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries put March any decision extending their oil production cutbacks prop prices. Moreover, improving technology exploration and production and opening new regions development have added already huge supply oil that is hand now. In response, many energy companies have already begun new wave cutbacks their staffs and operations. To further reduce costs, companies Mobil are forming partnerships that stop short full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agreed combine its European refining and marketing operations British Petroleum's, resulting annual savings $500 million. Shell and Texaco then formed refining partnership United States. In face these partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, energy analysts James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy Houston, if you're Exxon, how do you compete? Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentrations gas stations certain areas United States, analysts say they have far more competition pump oil prices collapsed 1980s. Thousands convenience stores now also sell gasoline produced variety refining companies, and foreign national oil companies, Venezuela's, sell their supplies acquired companies Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil has been hunting ways becoming large and lean enough survive. He took lead deal British Petroleum and has considered buying smaller companies. And he has made it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block deal. In European agreement British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses have come fronts many gas stations, while green and yellow BP logos have gone up. As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If price is right, egos will not get way. In past, Mobil reportedly had further talks British Petroleum other combinations, well talks Amoco forming American refining venture. The company was also interested Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. began looking divest itself that oil and gas business. But no deals were reached. More recently, there was speculation Wall Street that Mobil had been talking Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase Amoco put more pressure Noto seek deal, Hervey said. I don't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum had not pulled trigger, he said. The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly August announcement expected $2 billion annual savings, has put companies large Exxon spot. There, Raymond has so far concentrated more making his operations more efficient finding allies. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources are greater Exxon's, some analysts say Exxon still has size and soundness absorb company Mobil's size. Only largest oil companies can afford take advantage today's best opportunities. Finding new fields deep waters coast West Africa or Gulf Mexico can require platforms costing $1 billion or more. Producing oil states former Soviet Union has taken more time and money many investors anticipated. In September, Noto was American executives invited Saudi leader visiting Washington greatly step investments his country, too. Noto spent 1977 1985 Saudi Arabia himself, building Mobil operations including huge refinery. But any new partnerships Saudis might require Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital. Back when Standard Oil organized its operations state, Exxon was Standard Oil New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil New York. Even Standard Oil monopoly was broken up, they remained several years same building Manhattan. Chernow, Rockefeller biographer, noted that two pieces Standard Oil trust are already likely be united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil Ohio 1970s, and Amoco was once Standard Oil Indiana. The break-up Standard Oil and resulting competition has been cited precedent current antitrust action Microsoft. Chernow sees no reason why allowing Exxon acquisition Mobil go should suggest more leniency Microsoft. Exxon would not be obviously larger its leading competitors, way Microsoft is, he said. In energy business today, he added, there are other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle. The boards Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected meet Tuesday consider possible merger agreement that would form world's largest oil company, source close negotiations said Friday. The source, who spoke condition anonymity, said prospects were good completing agreement. Exxon and Mobil confirmed Friday that they were discussing ways combine. They cautioned, however, that no agreement had been reached and there was no assurance they would reach one. The statement sent stock companies surging, suggesting investors believe companies will combine. Shares Exxon, biggest U.S. oil company, rose $1.6875, or 2.3 percent, $74.375. Shares Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose $7.625, or 9.7 percent, $86. Some analysts said that if two giants reached agreement, it was likely be form takeover Exxon Mobil. Exxon is far larger and financially stronger. Analysts predicted that there would be huge cuts duplicate staff companies, which employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, oil analyst BT Alex. Brown, said that companies would probably make cuts $3 billion $5 billion year. Sieminski and other analysts said Exxon would have offer premium 15 20 percent its price prior Monday, when serious speculation Exxon takeover Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil shares sharply. They said transaction would probably be exchange Mobil shares Exxon shares. Based Mobil's $75.25 share price week ago, takeover company would be worth $70 billion. The merger discussions come backdrop particularly severe pressure Lucio Noto, chairman, president and chief executive Mobil, find new reserves oil and natural gas and keep big projects profitable time deep decline crude oil prices. This is one most intelligent chief executives business and man considerable ability he inherited some serious structural problems his company, said J. Robin West, chairman Petroleum Finance Co., consulting group energy industry based Washington. He said that Mobil's prime assets include Arun natural gas field Indonesia, one largest world, which has contributed one-third Mobil's profits years is beginning run down. The field, production 1977, supplies liquefied natural gas Japan and Korea. Although Mobil Noto has moved quickly cut costs and muscle its way promising new areas such Kazakhstan, where it is partner joint venture develop huge Tengiz oil field, payoff such ventures is many years away. Other companies face similar strains. The challenge is replace their crown jewels and grow increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto has not been shy sitting other companies such British Petroleum and Amoco this year see if combination made sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads much stronger and bigger company Mobil, he has not been immune strains global petroleum business. Those strains intensified this year when Russia's economic collapse raised risks Exxon's extensive exploration venture that country. Exxon has also been more follower leader huge projects deep offshore fields, where major finds have been made West Africa and Gulf Mexico. News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants energy patch, were merger talks last week is biggest sign that corporate marriages are back vogue. Even that combination came light, deal-making was fast and furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion corporate acquisitions were either announced or declared imminent. Driving resurgence mergers is roaring stock market, recognition major corporations that it is getting harder increase revenues internally and growing confidence market players that economy will not plunge recession next year. There are also industry-specific issues, low crude-oil prices that are driving oil giants one another's arms. But investors, mega-marriages are not where real money is be made. Rather, it is smaller companies, whose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers stocks that again are their peaks. If Exxon buys Mobil close current prices, deals this month will have total value more $140 billion  April's peak $244 billion three times volume September, when stock market was falling. Which industries are likely witness most mergers? Tom Burnett, director Merger Insight, institutional investment advisory firm New York, says more deals are certainty energy, which is suffering low crude-oil prices. Burnett also says health care executives are finding it tougher ever lift earnings. But smaller companies may be better way play takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor Special Situation Investor newsletter Potomac, Md., said: Some premiums high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore. The values are small-cap stocks. Another reason is that deals involving smaller-cap candidates are less likely incur wrath antitrust regulators. LaLoggia reckons that odds picking takeover winners increase if investor focuses companies already partially owned another. In energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, he says; oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned Keyspan Energy. He also believes more deals are imminent drug chains and supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says, remain acquisition candidates, though neither is controlled another concern. In supermarkets, LaLoggia likes Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned Tengelmann Group Germany. Another pick is Smart and Final, operator warehouse-style stores that is 55 percent owned U.S. subsidiary Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final are trading just book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur book value. Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, maker housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading $39, close its low year. The company has $30 share cash its balance sheet, no debt and dividend yield 5 percent. After last month's announced acquisition Rubbermaid Newell Co., LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find itself acquirer's cross-hairs. It was new highs again Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes Friday anticipation new wave mergers and general rush investors join equity rebound pushed stocks up. Oil stocks led way investors soaked news continuing talks Exxon and Mobil merger that would create world's largest oil company. Internet and computer stocks also rallied, helped part announcement Tuesday America Online's purchase Netscape Communications three-way deal involving Sun Microsystems. At same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are scheduled formally announce their merger Monday. There is no question that merger euphoria is headline, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. But flow mutual funds is also strong. Exxon rose 1 11/16, 74], while Mobil jumped 7|, 86. Chevron, reflecting bounce that other oil companies got merger news, climbed 5\, 85|. Exxon and Chevron, IBM, which rose 3\, 170, were main drivers Dow Jones industrial average. It climbed 18.80 points, or two-tenths percent, 9,333.08. It now stands just 41 points short record it set Monday and 1.9 percent week. Mobil, Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rose 3 13/16, 128 1/16, were power S &AMP; P. It climbed 5.46 points, or five-tenths percent, 1,192.33, new high, second week. It jumped 2.5 percent last five trading days. Cisco Systems, 2 15/16, 80; MCI Worldcom, 1 11/16, 62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, 4|, 80], and Microsoft pushed Nasdaq index its first new high July 20. The technology-heavy index finished 31.23 points, or 1.57 percent, higher, 2,016.44. It was 4.6 percent week. Whether Friday's gains will stick will not be known Monday. It was shortened trading session, New York Stock Exchange closing 1 p.m., and trading volume, 257 million shares, made it lightest day year. In bond market, which also closed early because Thanksgiving weekend, price 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, 101 12/32. The bond's yield, which moves direction price, fell 5.16 percent 5.18 percent Wednesday. Long-term and short-term yields all slipped lower this week new economic data that indicated economy was stronger third quarter expected and seems be moving good pace current quarter. This small recovery face stronger growth is probably because new inflation numbers show that prices are check and analysts are still forecasting that economy will begin slow next year. Many analysts have noted eight-week stock market rally, which Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, that investors were buying again though major financial problems world  including slumping Asia, weakening Latin America and troubled Russia  have not been resolved. Johnson said he thought that investors, inspired Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts two months and new stimulus package Japan, assume that these problems will be solved. Investors are looking valley and they what they see, he said. But he worries that financial crisis, which began Thailand July 1997 and was intensified effective default Russia August, will not go away quickly. It seems that every financial crisis, everybody gets impression that storm has passed, Johnson said. But it is never that easy. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions combining their business operations, person involved talks said Wednesday. It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing. If companies were merge, it would create largest U.S. company terms revenue. A possible merger was reported separately The Financial Times London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, come oil prices have sunk their lowest almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's largest oil company revenue. Financial terms discussions could not be determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon was then known Standard Oil New Jersey, and Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York and Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, which has market value $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which has market value $61.1 billion, have history being fiercely independence. Both have already cut back staff and made themselves lean order survive long periods when oil prices are low. But this has been particularly unsettling year oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives most oil companies have had swallow their pride and look suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announced $48.2 billion agreement buy Amoco Corp., creating world's third-largest oil company and prompting analysts predict more widespread consolidation. It showed that megamergers are doable, said Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that combination Exxon and Mobil would not be easy match because Mobil has been known being proud company that has said that it would not want merge. Exxon, he added, is well run company that likes grow its businesses. He added that heads companies, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, which is based Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, chairman, president and chief executive Mobil, which is based Fairfax, Va., are different personalities. It will not be easy, he said combining two far-flung companies, which have vast networks refineries and gas stations that overlap United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both companies are pressure find new fields oil help them survive long term. Like other oil companies, they had hoped quickly tap vast reserves Russia. Even though they were prepared spend billions, they have held back because political and economic crisis Russia and great reluctance Russian officials and oil companies give control vast fields. Thus they have had fall back their exploration areas such deep waters Gulf Mexico and West Africa. Such exploration is very expensive, and when large fields are found it takes platforms costing $1 billion bring oil production. Oil prices have been pressure more year, falling more 40 percent $20-a-barrel level because growing inventories petroleum and declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have tried stem price drops pledges cut back production. But those pledges have not always been honored, and rallies oil market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC members Wednesday continued their discussion extending their production cutbacks, and agreement is expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrels day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrels. The main result that agreement appears have been keep oil prices falling $10 barrel. Washington regulators said Wednesday that they had not been notified Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, which would review how much industry such merger would control. Analysts and investment bankers were split logic possible merger. Some pointed difficulties that companies could face if they were combined. If you asked me if Exxon needed be bigger, answer is probably no, said Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank based New York. It is hard say that there is anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two companies have enormous similarities their domestic refining and marketing businesses. They really do overlap quite bit, he said. You really do wonder what is benefit all that redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speaking condition anonymity, also questioned rationale discussed merger. When you look BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it, banker said. But none those reasons apply Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, said combination two companies would be logical, part because it would give them greater influence bidding projects Middle Eastern countries. This is deal that makes sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combined company, there is no project that would be too big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, merger would provide each company new oil and gas assets areas world where they had little influence. There are lot complimentary assets where they are not redundant, she said. She said that Exxon, example, has strong presence Angola, while Mobil does not. And Mobil has significant assets Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak. Exxon and Mobil, nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday that they were discussing possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that any deal would require sale important large pieces such new corporate behemoth. Those divestitures would further reshape industry already undergoing broad transformation because low price oil. But mergers and other corporate combinations are also beginning create new regulatory climate antitrust officials, one that may prove particularly challenging Exxon and Mobil. Although companies only confirmed that they were discussing possibility merger, person close discussions said boards Exxon and Mobil were expected meet Tuesday consider agreement. Shares surged New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily present antitrust problems Exxon-Mobil merger because competition those areas is brisk. But retailing and marketing operations, Exxon-Mobil combination would be Ford merging General Motors, Macy's Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, antitrust lawyer New York who represented Texaco its acquisition Getty more decade ago. In United States, deal would come purview Federal Trade Commission, which Clinton administration has examined large corporate mergers vigor not seen 1970s. The agency has blocked number proposed mergers, such $4 billion combination Staples and Office Depot, two largest office supply discounters, and two deals involving four largest drug wholesalers. On other hand it has approved other big mergers, such Boeing's $14 billion acquisition McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis Exxon-Mobil combination, senior official said Friday, will turn how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust it was dismantled Supreme Court 1911. The big antitrust issue is whether, merger or alliance, they will be able get competition one another their backs, particularly background BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco, said Eleanor M. Fox, professor New York University School Law and antitrust expert. It may be that we are looking consolidation world level that looked consolidation national level 100 years ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approved significant joint venture Shell and Texaco venture agreed sell refinery and divest some retailing operations Hawaii and California. It is also proposed $54 billion merger British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have re-examine that combination light new talks Exxon and Mobil. In past, when there have been two mergers involving same industry, government has considered them together deciding how deal them, said Terry Calvani, former commissioner Federal Trade Commission whose clients now include Chevron. But coming aftermath Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals, combination Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery businesses United States and Europe, poses questions that antitrust officials have not confronted 1980s. It's real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst Bear Stearns. If FTC let this one go major divesting, then everything would be fair game. Why couldn't GM merge Ford? While 1911 breakup Standard Oil is viewed Washington officials and industry executives ancient history, Exxon and Mobil have become dominant rivals some retailing and refining markets, and production lubricants and petrochemicals. Leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary this case could be so large that they are deal-breakers. Other analysts and lawyers, while disagreeing that required divestitures could kill deal, said companies would nonetheless have shed significant operations and that they expected challenges be raised broad spectrum constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials. These are not absolute obstacles, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In past, when two big oil companies have merged, aggressive attorneys general states have almost always become involved raising questions because high visibility local gas station. When state attorney general drives and sees four stations corner and two them are Mobil and Exxon, they are certain raise questions, Axinn said. Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations retailing and marketing concerns Northeast, Southwest and West Coast, where they also have big refining operations. Because two companies are involved everything exploration and shipping refining and retailing, meaning deal consumers will take months regulators sort out. The regulators examining such transaction would dissect each business, determine whether its market is global, national or more local, and determine whether combined entity has too high concentration business those areas. Experts agreed that regulators are most likely permit Exxon and Mobil keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and merger would not result higher prices. Hervey said those markets are already so fragmented that combined market share major American and European oil companies is only 17 percent. They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. So when 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here Mobil's largest domestic refinery, out 1,500 decade ago, heard last week that their company was discussing possible merger Exxon, it was siren warning them that already suspect valve might be blow. I think it's terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, refinery operator, he emerged plant's artificial twilight main gate his 12-hour shift ended 4:30 Sunday morning. He stopped rub eyes rimmed red, this topic his bedtime could be delayed. It's revival Standard Oil Company. It's going put 20 or 30 thousand people out work. I think Justice Department should step and stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore Big E patch appropriate his scale, added his uh-huh's. The latest evidence where things were heading hulked right nearby, he said, glancing new power plant likely be operated company unions that now man refinery's generators. But if Mobil Corp. has be sold, Lewis said, noting gains his company stock holdings, buyer solid and large Exxon Corp. might be least all evils. If we merged Chevron, we'd be Moron, he added. A growing American economy that can make billionaire out someone unproven idea Internet marketing is still sloughing workers older industries, petroleum much any. Those here point tote board Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say shows they have already handled 171 million barrels out 130 million planned full year. But numbers that matter more are ones 89.9, 88.9, 81.9, nearby gas stations  lowest prices, inflation, Depression. Which is why Mobil and Exxon are combining world's largest oil company. Some people close talks cautioned that no deal would be considered their boards least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And that is why, beginning last Wednesday evening, phone home Jimmy Herrington, president Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang stop. No, he didn't know that merger talk television, said Herrington, who also works full-time producing lubricants. He had asked some Mobil managers, meeting earlier this month, all rumors, they said they had heard nothing. Oil industry analysts say that first targets combined company's efforts cut billions dollars annual costs would be office staff and professionals, geologists and engineers, field. One company's accountants could almost do work two. But crews here fully expect that Exxon or any other buyer would ask again whether refinery could turn more crude oil gasoline, motor oil and other products fewer people. Union leaders raise prospect that Exxon would have sell refinery. Antitrust regulators, they say, are bound notice that Exxon has refineries hour's drive one direction and three hours other, Gulf Mexico crescent that forms petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, steaming, humming chemistry set lining Neches River Gulf, has become prime provider livelihoods here it was built almost spray nearby Spindletop gusher. With mounting overtime that can stretch shift 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 year. People go there retire there, Herrington said, he drove plant's fenced periphery. Lewis, his 17th year, is third-generation employee. But his nephew laboring here too is exception. The workers streaming and plant dawn are mostly balding or going gray, sign that full generation refinery has been more concerned how get rid workers how attract them. The cutbacks have, so far, come attrition, retirements encouraged incentives. But plywood sheets covering windows most fast food places and gas stations Herrington's union hall advertise that best times are long gone. His members chafe experts who come Wall Street question justification every person's job. In tiring and dangerous tasks, they question elimination most relief laborers favor covering vacations and sickness overtime (although some extra pay, and they say plant has become safer years). They complain growing numbers contractors taking formerly unionized tasks. But many workers choosing invest least some retirement savings Mobil stock, 1990s ethos is gaining. Some share credit plant's management efficiency measures they agree are necessary true job security. Some take attitude that every company is always sale. They will not be too concerned what we feel it, said Sam Salim, one electrical plant workers whose future is uncertain. But if they fork out $60 billion? I'd look it over. With most Mobil executives saying little possible now, calls Sunday local plant manager and company spokesman not elicit peep. Union leaders, however, are already squawking. I don't believe creating new monopolies is way prop industry, said Robert Wages, former refinery operator himself and now union's president, telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, admirable foresight union negotiated clause last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that any company buyer would have keep its terms. Many members, who typically came work high school, are already molding oil companies' latest exploits case studies fit rapacious MBA's. They're biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, assistant operator gasoline and lubrication oil units, referring Exxon. He was coming, early Sunday morning, plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed self-service station. So they go buy second biggest. That's one way get rid competition. I just hope it's not something 80s  buying companies and scrapping them. Or something Robber Baron era century before, said Mabry, another operator. Didn't teachers teach us all school that Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? he said, looking his friend, Lewis, Big E, agreement. But I better shut up. I still work Mobil. Used to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions combining their business operations, person involved talks said Wednesday. It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing. If companies were merge, it would create largest U.S. company terms revenue. A possible merger was reported separately The Financial Times London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that General Electric Co., and Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, came oil prices sank their lowest almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's largest oil company revenue. Financial terms discussions could not be determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon was then known Standard Oil New Jersey, and Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York and Vacuum Oil. As oil prices have plummeted levels last seen mid-1980s, oil companies have been pressure cut costs. Exxon, which has market value $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which has market value $61.1 billion, have histories being fiercely independent, and have already cut back staff and made themselves lean survive prolonged period low oil prices. But this has been particularly unsettling year oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives most oil companies have had swallow their pride and look suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announced agreement buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 million, creating world's third-largest oil company and prompting analysts predict more widespread consolidation.

It will not be easy, he said combining two far-flung companies, which have vast networks refineries and gas stations that overlap United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both companies are pressure find new fields oil help them survive long term. Like other oil companies, they had hoped quickly tap vast reserves Russia. Even though they were prepared spend billions, they have held back because political and economic crisis Russia and great reluctance Russian officials and oil companies give control vast fields. Thus they have had fall back exploration areas their such deep waters Gulf Mexico well West Africa and parts Asia. Such exploration is very expensive, and when big field is discovered, platforms costing $1 billion or more are required bring it production. Oil prices have been pressure more year, falling more 40 percent $20-a-barrel level because growing inventories petroleum and declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have tried stem price drops pledges cut back production. But those pledges have not always been honored, and rallies oil market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC members Wednesday continued their discussion extending their production cutbacks, and agreement is expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrels day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrels. The main result that agreement appears have been keep oil prices falling $10 barrel. Washington regulators said Wednesday that they had not been notified Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, which would review how much industry combined company would control. Analysts and investment bankers were split logic potential deal. Some pointed difficulties that companies could face if they were combined. If you asked me if Exxon needed be bigger, answer is probably no, said Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank based New York. It is hard say that there is anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two companies have enormous similarities their domestic refining and marketing businesses. They really do overlap quite bit, he said. You really do wonder what is benefit all that redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speaking condition anonymity, also questioned rationale discussed merger. When you look BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it, banker said. But none those reasons apply Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, said combination two companies would be logical, part because it would give them greater influence bidding development projects Middle East. This is deal that makes sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combined company, there is no project that would be too big. Ms. Jaffe said proposed deal would provide each company assets areas where it had little influence. There are lot complementary assets where they are not redundant, she said. She said that Exxon, example, has strong presence Angola, while Mobil does not. And Mobil has significant assets Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak. Times are tough oil patch. Still, it boggles mind accept notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil either merge, British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed do, or least consider prospect, Exxon and Mobil are doing. Still, Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed low petroleum prices and high capital costs exploration. Given exotic locales most promising, untapped fields, it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And West Texas crude trading $12 barrel, it seems safe bet oil that won't be selling $100 barrel turn century  price some analysts early 1980s were predicting it would reach. Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher Petroleum Economics Monthly and senior adviser Brattle Group, Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent some time late last week talking Mobil, Exxon and changing dynamics oil business. Following are excerpts conversation: Q. (italics)There is lot focus antitrust aspects Exxon-Mobil deal. Do you see any problems?(end italics) A. Let me say right that I don't think this is done deal. I think it is far that. But if it were happen, I don't see many problems. BP Amoco is perfect end-to-end merger, one which there is little or no overlap company you are merging with. Exxon-Mobil comes close. The first issue is competition local markets. The only possible problem area there is West Coast, companies are pretty small players there. If there is reason this merger might get extra attention, it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly either Clinton administration's or European Union's positions global warming. Q. (italics)Why are you skeptical deal?(end italics) A. Well, Mobil has been trying get bigger. They had talks Amoco. They wanted buy Conoco. But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fits this. That could be impediment agreement, because merger I don't think he has place, and he has been very strong leader. Q. (italics)Mobil is country's second-biggest oil company, Exxon. Why do they need get bigger?(end italics) A. In first decade next century, really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only companies deepest pockets will be able stay game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. Companies Mobil's size are probably marginal players. Q. (italics)That suggests Mobil has been harder hit Exxon downturn prices.(end italics) A. From 1988 1996, Exxon's exploration and production expenditures rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. But Mobil's expenditures were much more sensitive price elasticities oil Exxon's. They were pushing envelope, and when prices fell they had cut back. Exxon has tried build very large presence systematically, paying much attention month-to-month or year-to-year fluctuations oil prices. They are brutally efficient. Q. (italics)Earlier this month Energy Department said oil prices would stay soft nearly decade. Do you agree?(end italics) A. You know, every time I see forecasts that go out that far I want go out and buy stock oil companies. I think we are going see low oil prices six months year. It is conceivable we could go next century oil $5 barrel, depending what happens world economy. During that period, we are going see substantial reduction investment exploration and production, leading reduction supply coming out non-OPEC countries. That will strengthen hands OPEC countries. And when Asian economies start growing again that will lead good deal higher oil prices, say $20 barrel, next 18 months. Q. (italics)The number oil companies is going shrink coming years, regardless, isn't it?(end italics) A. We are probably heading world which there are no more five or six big oil companies, possibly eight. There is really no precedent having many big players we have oil business this modern society. Q. (italics)Do you think oil stocks are good investment?(end italics) A. I think oil companies are still worthwhile investment, it is not place where investor should plan making money next 9 12 months. And it is area where investors need be careful, because that period there will be good deal consolidation smaller companies. Times are tough oil patch. Still, it boggles mind accept notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil either merge, British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed do, or least consider prospect, Exxon and Mobil are doing.

46,"The raw passions were such that House Democrats not hesitate bellow You resign! You resign! Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he called House floor President Clinton quit White House face certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston just that. He quit one breathtaking utterance, if flicking trump card heap impeachment angst festering his eyes debating chamber. In his one and only strategem leading his fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress verbal bomb. Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized instant. They had stand, almost staggering their feet, join Republicans prolonged, emotional ovation Livingston and his undeniable self-sacrifice. As they stood, Democrats sensed Livingston had most suddenly closed trap president and his defenders. For, impeachment issue set move Senate, Livingston, whose marital indiscretions were now public his obvious misery, chose show how question political leader's resignation was very much play this tumult-tossed city. I must set example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending impeachment debate and nation watching beyond. Livingston walked floor sheriff some bullet-pocked political High Noon, discarding leadership badge he had wrested earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In corridor just beyond, doorman shouted police officer: Livingston just resigned! What? What? came reply officer, who obviously thought momentous announcement would be Clinton's impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, Democrats, already deep bone-raw exhaustion their long fight president, grasped bearings. It is surrender developing sexual McCarthyism! declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., leading presidential defender trying rally Democrats argument that Livingston should not resign any more President Clinton should quit fire. But Republicans were surging fore strength Livingston's announcement, fighting tears they rose salute him ultimate political role model grueling impeachment process it roared final minutes debate. For some it is no longer good enough make mistake, confirm that mistake and take consequences that mistake, said Tom DeLay, Republican whip, his hands shaking, his eyes tearing he addressed House and sought drive example Livingston all way Pennsylvania Avenue. He understood what this debate was all  honor, duty, integrity and truth, said DeLay arguing that one swift blow, Livingston had demonstrated himself have been far better speaker Clinton has been president. With something political elan president showed initiating Iraq attack his impeachment loomed, House Republicans, battered public opinion polls, had found rocket's red glare their own. I have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness, Livingston told House, nation and his family he announced retreat. Only moments before, Democrats openly hissed man Livingston firmly read his judgment president: Sir, you have done great damage this nation year. Presidential resignation was order, he continued, and then came shouts You resign! You resign! And Livingston closed circle his career, he stunned place collective breath disbelief and somehow almost threatened reduce dark historic issue House  impeachment president  matter anticlimax. They must not succeed, David Bonior, Democratic whip said Republicans he was given task refocusing day misdeeds president, not departure speaker. We are here debate impeachment and should not be distracted that, he declared. The only way we can stop this vicious cycle, Bonior cried out floor, is if we refuse give it, whether it is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston. But House was still reeling frenzied day fateful vote presidency approached and notion resignation licked capital city flame forest. Rejecting last-minute Democratic attempt soften its action censure, House Representatives moved impeach President William Jefferson Clinton perjury Saturday and call Senate try him, convict him and remove him office. But vote, Republicans pressed another line attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated speaker last month his party, startled House when he announced he would not run speaker and would resign House 21 years service. He urged president heal wounds that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post. Angry Democrats booed and shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I can only challenge you such fashion if I am willing heed my words. Apologizing again extramarital affairs revealed two days ago, he said, I believe I had it me do fine job. But I cannot do that job or be kind leader that I would be current circumstances. Then he bolted House chamber, nearly knocking reporters and members down. (The House voted 228-206 approve first article impeachment, accusing Clinton committing perjury federal grand jury. The vote was announced 1:24 p.m. EST, leaving 42nd president face trial Senate whether he should be removed office.) Clinton rejected advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president has no intention resigning. By calling Livingston reconsider, president argued more broadly resignation fire. Perhaps speaking cases, Lockhart said, It would be wrong give this insidious politics personal destruction. Unless Clinton changes course, this would be only second impeachment president 209-year history Republic, and first Andrew Johnson was acquitted 1868. Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, has insisted that no bargaining censure can prevent it starting. But Senate could halt trial later part deal. Considering degree partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling two-thirds majority required Constitution conviction is most unlikely. Sixty-seven votes would be required, and there are only 55 Republicans Senate, 45 Democrats. Four articles impeachment House charged Clinton perjury lying his affair Monica Lewinsky federal grand jury here Aug. 17. He was also charged perjury Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction justice and abuse power. The Republican argument, and over, was that Clinton had lied denying having sexual relations Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey Texas, majority leader, said, A nation laws cannot be ruled person who breaks law. Rep. Nancy Johnson Connecticut said: There can be no justice truth. That is just profoundly so, and that is why perjury matters. Rep. Gerald Kleczka Wisconsin began Democrats' arguments saying, What president was wrong, personally and morally, his acts not threaten our democracy and thus do not rise level impeachable offenses defined our founding fathers our Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule law requires that punishment fit crime. Allow us vote censure. Saturday's votes were penultimate step most serious conflict Congress and president Richard M. Nixon resigned face impeachment and certain conviction Aug. 9, 1974. But while that case spun out 1972 break-in Democratic headquarters Watergate complex, this one began murky land deal Arkansas 1978. Through efforts Kenneth Starr, independent counsel law enacted wake Watergate, investigation spread examine Clinton's affair White House intern. All year it has preoccupied capital immense disconnect public opinion; scandal became public January, polls have shown that public opposed impeachment and wanted inquiry brought end. Even Friday night, 13-hour debate, CBS News Poll 548 people showed that only 38 percent wanted their representative vote impeachment; 58 percent wanted no vote. The conflict now enters uncharted seas, Nixon resignation cut matter short and Johnson trial occurred different America, no nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion polls. But capital was still rife confident speculation. Some guessed, or hoped, that results recent poll, which showed increases support resignation way spare nation trial which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought Republicans, seeing dismal numbers polls their party's standing United States, would be first blink. With majority Senate, they have power end trial any time Senate receives notice impeachment day it convenes, Jan. 6, or next day. But while Clinton has focused polls, and CBS News survey showed that 64 percent still approve his handling his job president, resignation could almost immediately subject him criminal prosecution. And Republicans have steadfastly ignored polls all year, and confronted them directly Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected chairman Republican caucus, said: What's popular isn't always right. You say polls are this. Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle. Polls would have rejected Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced slavery and ridiculed women's rights. You say we must draw this close. I say we must draw line right and wrong, not tiny fine line executive fountain pen, big fat lead No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid America can see it. The point is not whether president can prevail, whether truth can prevail. Last weekend, when Judiciary Committee recommended four articles impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped prevail help 20 30 Republican moderates who were uncommitted. As week wore on, almost all them broke president. One who not, Rep. Christopher Shays Connecticut, said Saturday: After Judge Starr's report Congress September, and his presentation Judiciary Committee November, I concluded that impeachable offenses were not proven, and that proven offenses were not impeachable. But president's continued failure come grips his actions, sincerity and arguments members Judiciary Committee sides aisle, change heart and conviction members my side aisle who originally opposed impeachment and who now support it, and strong and powerful opinion so many my constituents who oppose my position and who wanted president impeached caused me rethink my position. He added: Yesterday morning, I visited president, I concluded that my original position was correct one, me. I believe that impeachable offenses have not been proven, and that proven offenses are not impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, who has led Republican effort force Clinton office, dismissed his and other arguments moral relativism. He began praising Livingston: There is no greater American my mind, least today, Bob Livingston, because he understood what this debate was all about. It was honor and decency and integrity and truth; everything that we honor this country. It was also debate relativism vs. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defenders have said that president is morally reprehensible, that he is reckless, that he has violated trust American people, lessened their esteem office president and dishonored office which they have entrusted him, and that  that doesn't rise level impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano New York said, My constituents don't hate Bill Clinton; they love him and they're praying him right this very moment. You may have votes today impeach him, you don't have American people. And let me tell you something, I grew public housing projects South Bronx. I can see bunch bullies when I see them. The bullies get theirs, and you're going get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde Illinois, Judiciary Committee chairman who brought charges House floor, said Congress and American people needed distinguish private acts infidelity and public acts public officials. In Clinton's case, he said, House was dealing serial violator oath who is chief law-enforcement officer. He said that Senate could be innovative and creative deciding how best punish Clinton, that House was bound Constitution move ahead articles impeachment. Justice is so important most humble us, Hyde said. Equal justice law  that's what we're fighting for. Democrats, reading same Constitution, voiced diametrically conclusions, and attacked fairness proceedings that culminated Saturday. We're losing track distinction sins and crimes, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. We're lowering standards impeachment. What president has done is not great and dangerous offense republic. Democrats also criticized Republicans impeaching Clinton very moment that U.S. troops waged war Iraq. Six days Christmas our troops are battle, and lame-duck Congress is rushing overthrow commander chief, said Rep. David Bonior Michigan, second-ranking House Democrat. The ghosts Watergate hung House chamber. One Republican cited parallels charges House Judiciary Committee brought Nixon 25 years ago, and counts that same committee brought House floor affirmation Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheated electoral system, said Rep. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, full House is voting impeach Clinton because we believe he committed crimes that result cheating our judicial system. But most day's debate was firmly rooted Clinton's effort conceal his sexual affair Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia Republican Judiciary Committee who is one Clinton's fiercest critics, held copies U.S. Criminal Code, Judiciary Committee's report impeachment inquiry and, finally, Constitution, defending his decision impeach president. Today, we rely three pillars our society: law itself, evidence and Constitution, said Barr. There is no joy upholding law, Watts said. If we cannot see lawlessness, our children cannot recognize it. How can we tell our children honesty is best policy when we don't demand it policy? But Democrats assailed very premise which Republican majority built its impeachment case Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. Michigan, ranking Democrat Judiciary Committee, assailed four articles impeachment, count count, unfounded evidence and failing rise impeachment. He saved his most savage scorn final count, abuse power. The majority has simply tried dress perjury counts Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed his colleagues Thursday night that he had had adulterous affairs, stunned House chamber Saturday morning saying impeachment debate President Clinton that he would not serve speaker and would quit Congress six months. He urged president follow his example and quit, too. But White House, where calls Clinton's resignation are derided Republican strategy, president sent spokesman driveway urge Livingston reconsider his resignation. Livingston stood well House he has served two decades and called Clinton resign his office rather force trial Senate, drawing boos his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit instead. He then just that. I must set example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston announced shocked and silent chamber act that left Republican Party total chaos just hours vote impeach Clinton. The decision also left party leaderless eve opening 106th Congress, when Republicans must govern one narrowest majorities history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, somberly welcomed news, suggesting it relieved them excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understood what this debate was all  it's honor and decency and integrity and truth, everything we honor this country. But Democrats said they were aghast, and many  including Clinton  called Livingston reconsider his decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation was wrong, declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. It is surrender developing sexual McCarthyism. Are we going have new test if someone wants run public office  are you now or have you ever been adulterer? He called country distinguish sins and crimes. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton was disappointed news Livingston's plans and wished that he would reconsider. Lockhart said president firmly believes that politics personal destruction this town and this country has come end. He reaffirmed that Clinton would not resign, saying: The president is going do what's best interest country. It would be wrong give this insidious politics personal destruction. Livingston's announced resignation was all more stunning its disclosure process that could result president's removal office. The speaker is second line presidency, vice president. Newt Gingrich, outgoing speaker, who was driven post Republicans lost five seats November election, technically remains speaker Jan. 6, when Livingston's election was be ratified new Congress. But Gingrich has removed himself daily operations House this extraordinary session and has begun dismantle his office. Livingston's decision was said be driven part anger group dozen conservatives his party who were disillusioned that he had withheld news his affairs them. They had threatened withhold their votes him election January that would formally make him speaker. He was also concerned pain caused his family further disclosures, some members said. They added that, not lost many his party, was example he would set president offering resign his post now. DeLay, No. 3 House Republican leadership, is expected fill power vacuum least temporarily, deed if not title, while party regroups find new speaker. Many members quickly rallied Rep. Dennis Hastert Illinois. Hastert, one DeLay's deputy whips who is well respected his colleagues, had been promoted candidate majority leader last month, never mounted campaign. Rep. Dick Armey Texas only precariously held his majority-leader post last month and was not considered likely candidate speaker. He is expected manage reorganization, which Republican leaders have set Jan. 4. Livingston met privately his closest advisers Friday impeachment debate unfolded. Some his colleagues believed he had made mistake disclosing Thursday night  just House was moving divisive debate impeachment  that he had occasion strayed my marriage. He told Republican leaders late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine was going expose his affairs early next year. Some leaders urged him keep quiet, his wife, Bonnie, encouraged him tell his colleagues immediately, momentous vote that was nearing floor. At that point Thursday night, Roll Call, newspaper Capitol Hill, reported its Web site that Livingston was going admit affairs and was going offer resign. In closed-door meeting his fellow Republicans, he admit affairs made no offer step down, receiving three standing ovations instead. Thursday night, Livingston stated that he would not be intimidated these efforts exploit his past. But Friday he removed himself public action and that night drew his closest advisers his confidence. His aides said Saturday that they had no clue what was he was contemplating, and few other members were aware his plans. Asked if he had any advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected member Republican leadership, said: I had no idea. Asked if there had been internal party pressure Livingston resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I didn't know it if there was, added, There were some members who were critical it. As leaders tried Saturday hold party together and House floor, most Republicans stuck their prepared scripts floor favor impeaching president. But some began expressing their anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who admitted his adulterous affair earlier this year, said Livingston's resignation: Those us who are sinners must feel wretched today. Something is going repeatedly that has be stopped, and that is confusion private acts infidelity and public acts. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress has no business intruding private acts. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, had made this same distinction Clinton's sexual indiscretions and Livingston's, saying that Clinton lied his private acts and therefore abused legal system and his powers. As Livingston said his statement Thursday: These indiscretions were not employees my staff and I have never been asked testify oath them. Democrats hoped that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake House how poisoned atmosphere had become and might prompt Republicans reconsider impeachment Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We are now starting offer sacrificial lambs terrible disease this is. In stirring speech applauded some Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, praised Livingston worthy, good and honorable man and said his resignation was grave mistake. It's terrible capitulation negative political forces that are consuming our political system and our country, Gephardt said, adding that events last few days showed life imitates farce. We need stop destroying imperfect people unattainable altar public morality, he said, urging his colleagues step back abyss and reject resignation, impeachment and vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive partisan impeachment based soley party-line voting power rather any sense proportion produced unexpected sideshow resignation Rep. Bob Livingston his role future speaker House. Analysts sides struggle President Clinton's future will point Livingston's downfall evidence generalized breakdown legislative civility Capitol Hill. Democrats will see moral symmetry, depicting Livingston victim sexual puritanism he was wielding Clinton. But one thing that no one should fall is Livingston's invitation use his resignation model resolving crisis White House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, it should not shake foundations somber constitutional process now underway. By lying oath, Clinton made it necessary House consider impeachment. The evidence convinced most Americans that president should be censured, not removed office. Livingston allowed GOP partisans block censure House. The result is that Saturday's expected impeachment vote, Livingston's unexpected announcement, mission Senate remains same. It must resist those Republicans who want short-circuit constitutional process demands resignation, and it must use upcoming Senate trial forum finding censure commensurate president's personal dishonesty and offenses law. These require stern punishment not removal office. In undertaking this work, Senate must also reassure American people that decisive wisdom core our messy-looking political system has not melted down. In such distempered times, this is shining opportunity Senate. Its members pride themselves being Republic's fire wall presidential excess and popular or partisan passions that sometimes seize House Representatives. No one can predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will rise defining challenge his career or whether he will surrender mean streak he acquired 16 grumpy years minority member House. We would see Lott reach starring role history. Lott's growling response questions censure is not encouraging. He may be right that Constitution requires him convene trial, nothing that document prevents him speedily guiding Senate censure negotiations. Indeed, simple majority vote  45 Democrats 6 cooperating Republicans  can end Senate trial any time, clearing way introduction kind censure resolution suggested former Sen. Bob Dole. In intriguing report NBC, Tim Russert described discussions bipartisan group senators censure that would involve some form presidential confession, fine and joint congressional request that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton courts. If Lott refuses allow bipartisan search censure, burden will fall respected members Joseph Lieberman Democratic side and Orrin Hatch Republicans. Through cooperation, they can guide Senate punishment that fixes Clinton history president who lied oath, avoids taint partisan vengeance associated House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation prudence requires it find appropriate punishment personally weak president who has damaged rule law, not threatened stability government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented fresh note shock impeachment debate President Clinton Thursday night Republican leader was forced admit his Republican colleagues that he had carried adulterous affairs his past. It has suddenly come my attention that there are individuals working together media who are investigating my personal background effort find indiscretions which may be exploitable me and my party eve upcoming historic vote impeachment, Livingston declared statement appearing shocked House Republican conference head disclosure it surfaced news reports. After hearing his admissions closed session, Livingston's colleagues gave him standing ovation support and said question his resigning had never arisen. My fate is your hands, Livingston told Republicans, according lawmakers who were present. The debate president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions speaker-elect's revelations and sex-and-mendacity scandal that has put Clinton brink impeachment. The president is charged impeachment resolution perjury and abuse power his attempt hide sexual indiscretions. Democrats offered no immediate comment, Republicans were braced hear Livingston's admissions alluded debate Friday Democrats who have decried investigation president basically partisan and unfair rummaging his sex life. Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had received forgiveness his family, noted he had several times told reporters his campaign become speaker that I was running speaker, not sainthood. He added, There was reason those words. During my 33-year marriage my wife, Bonnie, I have occasion strayed my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my marriage and family, Livingston said his brief prepared statement. But he attempted draw contrast allegations president, asserting: I want assure everyone that these indiscretions were not employees my staff and I have never been asked testify oath them. The disclosure speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed Rollcall, Capitol Hill newspaper, sent new jolt uncertainty lawmakers they prepared momentous debate president's admitted misbehavior office and whether he should be impeached and tried Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican chairman House Judiciary Committee who is bring impeachment charges president, previously was cited magazine extra-marital affair his past. Then, Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicions that Democratic defenders president instigated media investigations effort embarrass Clinton's principal accusers. But no proof was offered Republicans left their conference, facing uncertainties debate that already promised be bare-knuckled its partisanship. Livingston left conference surrounded Capitol police, not taking questions waiting reporters. His chief leadership aides immediately rallied support. Some who would rather not struggle this constitutional question continue try twist debate unseemly investigation private lives, said Rep. Dick Armey, Republican majority leader. In its report internet Thursday night, Rollcall not disclose its source made oblique reference Hustler, sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher Hustler, earlier this year advertised offer $1 million bounty information e members Congress guilty sexual indiscretions. It breaks your heart because we're all subject human frailties, said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., he left conference. This is not comfortable circumstance anyone, he added, insisting president and speaker-elect presented two separate issues. We've got duty do Constitution. It has gotten point where drastic action may be necessary. You know those movies Ebola virus outbreaks, where guys sterile suits come in, seal area and completely irradiate it? They may have do that Washington. Just eradicate us and start scratch. In few, short days we have managed make terms surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train and politics personal destruction useless cliches. We no longer govern here. We just roll gutter wondering who's next this sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, we had surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image Bob Livingston, speaker-elect, stepping his marital infidelities were revealed. We are all pawns chessboard, Livingston said, asking president resign and then resigning himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit president, he hoped hide his dirty laundry, made him avatar hypocrisy capital rotting hypocrisy. On Thursday night, when Livingston first confessed his sins Republicans hopes keeping his hold his post, his colleagues gave him standing ovation. And he made his surprise announcement Saturday, Republicans gave him another ovation and stepped deliver encomiums their lost speaker. One's self-esteem gets utterly crushed times this, sighed Henry Hyde, another tormenter president who also had admit that he had succumbed temptation. Tom DeLay, jagged-edge exterminator who may next-up speaker roundelay, was choked up, praising greatness Livingston understanding that this was debate relativism absolute truth. What could be more relative Republican who has hidden lot affairs trying impeach president lying his? Spurred Larry Flynt's bounty sinnuendo, city was braced more craziness. The Ship Fools reached cruising speed Friday evening, when we had frightening scene Republicans so crazed hatred president that they were railroading impeachment though United States was war Iraq, though House chamber was mostly empty, though Republicans were huddled glass house issue sex and lies, and though White House was still pitching tent and planning sleigh rides Winter Wonderland press party Monday. (The White House was keeping journalists quarantined this year, encouraged them bring their kids. To soak some that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt. Why are Republicans so obsessed, when everyone his right mind agrees that impeachment is outlandishly over-the-top punishment Clinton and self-destructive course country? Because they genuinely hate president. They think he's dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child '60s. They don't think they're going pay political price this, and if they do, they don't care. It might be great time see lot combovers, it's not great time see lot stature. The House debate was not history. It was just more hideous version The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans tried draw distinction that Clinton had perjured himself, they ignored that president had been lured Starr-Jones attorney team testifying Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry Livingston. But Republicans have brought this sexual doomsday machine themselves focusing so single-mindedly Clinton's sex life. The Republicans were so determined do their high-tech lynching that they engaged wacky role reversals. Many Republican hawks argued that Bill Clinton should not be bombing Saddam, claiming timing was suspicious, though they had hammered him not bombing five weeks ago. In incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, majority leader, and former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Bush Secretary State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed attack. There's too much hate here. And I hate it. We are here debate impeachment and should not be distracted that, minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat Michigan, said Saturday's House debate, what leaped out impossible goal. It would have taken kaleidoscopic television screen capture constantly shifting images competing center stage: impeachment, Iraq, resignation Rep. Robert Livingston, response White House. The months leading impeachment President Clinton had become series televised anticlimaxes, hours vote made that lack drama. There were hardly enough shorthand terms or split screens cover activity. All networks and cable channels carried moment that unexpectedly set tone, Livingston, Louisiana Republican, announced debate that he would not become House speaker. The commentators had been set carry congressional ratification inevitable vote, suddenly most plugged-in reporters were caught guard. As Tim Russert said Tom Brokaw NBC, Tom, knock us all over. In echo chamber that television news so becomes, shared mantra had been weightier early morning. For only second time American history president would be impeached, went standard line. Yet all pundits speculating and politicians telegraphing every move, no one had hinted Livingston resignation. The announcement was, Brokaw put it, least partly political ploy, and repercussions were immediate. Reporters began gathering word Capitol Hill candidates speaker's job, and conversation moved next stage political tug war. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation say that president should resign, too; Democrats immediately countered idea that president would stay and that Livingston should well. That led one less-expected split screens day, and it was not bad choice. While Congress was debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft fire Baghdad one box. In other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stood White House driveway telling reporters that president would Livingston reconsider his decision. There was more stateliness House television offers, and one reason was purely visual. Keep mind that we do not control picture, Dan Rather said CBS, explaining that television cameras Congress are provided House, not individual networks. There was no way roam and zoom reaction shots, political convention. But sense history and decorum didn't last long CBS. At noon, vote, CBS went football game, becoming only network leave news coverage. CBS' corporate decision try have it ways meant that Rather would break updates Washington. I'll see you very soon, he said he signed complete coverage, looking trouper. But he was position no news anchor should have been this day. He later announced impeachment votes split screen football game progress upper part screen. On other networks and cable channels, vote itself literally happened background. As TV screens toted numbers electronically-cast vote, members Congress milled and chatted floor. Even brief Democratic walkout motion consider censure was defeated was thoroughly forecast. As Democrats straggled steps Congress, it looked curiously undramatic television, though it probably made better still photograph once they were all place. And while votes were progress, jockeying speaker's job heated up. We already have presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill NBC News said midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., who had also been cited other networks likely candidate. If political and military action had not intruded, it might have been more obvious that debate House floor sent message vast divisions politics and morality, signaling how deep cultural fissure this crisis has opened. The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, was debate relativism vs. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contended that Congress had lost distinction sins and crimes, and argued sexual McCarthyism that has become prominent. And backdrop revelations adultery that led Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, declared politics personal destruction has end. But all jabbering and political posturing continued, reporters raced cover president's statement impeachment and latest briefings Pentagon, there was little time focus profound cultural message those rhetorical flourishes. Bob Livingston, incoming speaker House, took no public role Friday debate unfolded whether impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hours had been his most visible month his party nominated him speaker and perhaps most excruciating his public career: He spent most day chaotic procedural wrangle terms Friday's debate; he ended it telling his Republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs his 20-year tenure Congress. His disclosure followed investigation Larry Flynt, publisher Hustler, sex magazine, who said Friday news conference Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication had learned that Livingston had had adulterous affairs last 10 years. Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted expose hypocrisy those Washington who are investigating Clinton and October offered $1 million anyone who could prove they had had affairs members Congress. He said Friday that this larger investigation, be published perhaps soon January, would reveal what he described indiscretions several other Republicans. He said he had no connection White House that he had hired investigative firm based Washington and made former employees FBI and CIA. He would not confirm whether firm is Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which has done work president's private lawyers. Livingston was unavailable reporters Friday. He spent some time Friday morning sprawled chair back House chamber, listening debate whether impeach Clinton lying his sexual indiscretions. Several colleagues knelt Livingston's knee, whispered him and patted him back. He spent most day private office chamber, avoiding gauntlet reporters who lay wait him House and his regular office street. The only word out his aides was that Navy had awarded contracts worth millions dollars ships be built his Louisiana district Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, handful Democrats made only oblique allusions human failures. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let he that has no sin cast first stone. Who, who us has not sinned? But no one said that Livingston's disclosure or mild Democratic attempts exploit it would influence their votes impeachment. Rather, House floor and hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed be last thing that either Republicans or Democrats wanted talk about. Bob Livingston is first-rate human being, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who has worked closely and sparred Livingston Appropriations Committee, interview. I will repeat what nuns taught me St. James long time ago: We would all be hell lot better looking our souls rather trying evaluate somebody else's. None us have any business having opinion it. Even conservative Republicans seemed ready overlook disclosure. We're not going say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated your vows your wife,' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct Clinton's saying that president had trampled legal system whereas Livingston's behavior was strictly private. Despite Flynt's claims, many Republicans blamed Clinton administration smearing Livingston, although they offered no evidence. This isn't just happening its own, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The only thing certain now is uncertainty. The smart money shouts that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs. The smart money argues that Senate could not muster 67 votes that would be needed remove wounded president office, which would require defection 12 Democrats if all Republicans stand him. The smart money insists that someone will cut deal end all this. Maybe so. But smarter money whispers, Remember. Remember that everyone Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman Judiciary Committee, said House would never, ever, treat impeachment partisan issue. Wrong. Remember that all pundits predicted Democratic losses midterm elections, and when happened, they said impeachment was dead. Twice wrong. And remember that New Year nation may travel road it has never traveled before. One other president, Andrew Johnson Tennessee, has been tried Senate, course. But that happened different country one only 37 states, primitive communications, simple economy based largely agriculture, only minimal commitments abroad. In toxic politics century's end Washington, inconceivable has become commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., that he would not serve speaker and would resign Congress, his equally unanticipated disclosure Thursday night several extramarital affairs, only deepened capital's profound sense insecurity. The deadly sweep scythe neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, least moment, and Livingston's forthcoming resignation will increase pressure president do likewise. You've set us example, leader House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, told Livingston Saturday. The example is that principle comes power. The Democrats made point, arguing that Livingston case showed how very wrong it was savage people personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remains same: Although surrounded judicial trappings and presided chief justice, trials presidents are political processes, power residing hands elective politicians. In addition narrow legal issues guilt or innocence, they can weigh considerations party, nation's future, their individual political well-being and almost anything else they care weigh reaching verdict. The longer they took, more numerous call resignation would probably be. Even Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four ten Americans interviewed latest New York Times/CBS News Poll said they thought president should step if he were be indicted, fact that large majority voiced disapproval impeachment proceedings. What lies that seeming contradiction, course, is fear that Clinton, and country him, would be incapacitated. No one took Andrew Johnson very seriously he escaped conviction single vote. But Clinton, man powerful will whose whole life has been series comebacks, has already embarked effort show that he can do nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed his way back respectability leaving White House when no one thought he could; Clinton intends re-establish his authority while still office. He has one great advantage: Two-thirds American public continues voice its approval his political stewardship, it thinks him man. The president will press hard, his much-reduced leverage, deal censure. Indeed, fine piece political irony one could ask for, he has already sought enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, Republican he defeated 1996, emissary Senate majority. The numbers are not unpromising: help six Republicans, 45 Democrats could end trial any time and pass censure resolution that House would surely take up. There are enough Republican moderates and sometime party-buckers make that plausible target. But Republican leader Senate, Trent Lott Mississippi, who has made his unwillingness take president's word plainly evident recent days, is determined fight such trial-aborting arrangement. It is clear that Clinton's reputation has been stained forever, no matter what Senate does. The spot will not out. History will remember this man who so coveted glowing legacy not impresario economic growth, not Moses who pointed way 21st century, second president ever be impeached, if not first be ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, will cling his name surely Teapot Dome clings Harding's and Depression Hoover's. But he is not alone having suffered grievous injury political avalanche that was shaken loose disclosure Clinton's sexual relationship former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support has shriveled 40 percent new Times/CBS News poll, its lowest level 14 years, and it could go lower once fact impeachment sinks in. Journalists are seen many jackals, indifferent personal suffering or national angst they may cause long they get story, and none too concerned accuracy. In fact, whole political culture 1990s, its criminalization political conduct and its seeming indifference important national and international issues, has fallen disrepute ordinary Americans. The last week seemed crystallize long-term decline political civility. Republicans called Clinton liar, he was committing American pilots skies Iraq, and Democrats accused their rivals conducting political lynching or political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may have been biggest victim all. Party lines Saturday's rolls calls held firm leg irons. Almost all Republicans who opposed impeachment so not exclusively legal principle least partly because special political circumstances  Democratic majority Rep. Constance Morella's district Maryland suburbs Washington, example, and gratitude Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Clinton's peacemaking Ireland. It is hard see who has emerged it reputation enhanced, perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch face deception. If some threats and dire predictions uttered House Democrats recent days are be taken face value, nation is entering Era Bad Feelings, polar second Era Good Feelings, similar that 1820s, that Clinton had hoped preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton Friday Sir Thomas More, executed treason 1535 because his religious beliefs. He quoted More's words admonition today: What you have hunted me is not my actions thoughts my heart. It is long road you have opened. God help statesmen who walk your road. But amidst all loose talk permanent damage this institution or that, remember: Things change startling speed modern American politics, and institutions American government have proved extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, it was almost universally agreed 1974, had weakened American presidency many decades come. Nobody said that eight years Ronald Reagan, and that was only 15 years later. In end, will people meant nothing. Bob Livingston couldn't have been clearer that. His mind and minds his followers were closed. Even bombing continued Iraq and Americans coast coast were clamoring alternative impeachment, his adulterous was being flushed out grotesque invasions privacy that inevitably followed relentlessly prurient pursuit president, country began contemplate destructive effects lengthy and bitter Senate trial, speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: Let us disregard influences. The radicals Hill would hear nothing echoes their fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And that continued stunning announcement Saturday morning that Livingston would quit House. Dismayed partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, Democratic leader, warned impeachment debate Friday: In your effort uphold Constitution, you are trampling Constitution. David Bonior, Democratic whip, said: This is wrong. It is unfair. It is unjust. At time when events world and challenges home demand that we stand united, censure is one solution that can bring us together. To my colleagues aisle, I say let go your obsession. Listen American people. But voices reason would not be heard. Livingston and his right-wing colleagues, Tom DeLays, Henry Hydes, Bob Barrs, were mission destruction and would not be denied. Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They could protest and demonstrate, send faxes and E-mails. It didn't matter. The right was march and democracy was run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, Democrat Wisconsin, tried remind his Republican colleagues that Constitution does not allow you remove president office because you can't stand him. He was, course, ignored. The Republicans will pay huge price their brazen, utterly partisan attempt drag president White House defiance will people. The party's contempt voters was arrogantly quite adequately summed Alan Simpson, former senator Wyoming, who said: The attention span Americans is which movie is coming out next month and whether quarterly report their stock will change. If voters are dopes that Mr. Simpson thinks they are, then come 2000 everyone will have forgotten there was impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., was probably closer truth when he said, I warn my colleagues that you will reap bitter harvest unfair partisan seeds you sow today. One many strange events couple weeks was way which virtually all previously undecided Republicans, so-called moderates, surrendered their independence and lined lackeys follow right wing's lead. All proclaimed loudly that they were voting principle, fact it was exercise mass cowardice, exemplified Rep. John McHugh upstate New York. McHugh announced Tuesday that he would vote impeachment. But if his decision was based principle, he had odd way expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared have no stomach Senate conviction or removal president office. Of his colleagues Senate, McHugh said, I, one, would accept, welcome, their mercy. In other words, let Senate do heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may have wished out loud mercy, he clearly was too frightened right-wingers House cast compassionate vote himself. The GOP can no longer conceal that it is party extremists, right-wing absolutists, party out step political and cultural orientation most Americans. Bob Livingston may be leaving, his arrogant comment can still serve his party's slogan. Let us disregard influences. Let us disregard people.

47,"The first part international space station was smoothly orbiting Earth Friday faultless launch that marked start new age space exploration and colonization. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried module its initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth and unit was operating planned, officials said. Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavour, which is be launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. Space officials 16 nations taking part project cheered rocket soared cloudy sky central Asian steppe Baikonur launch pad Friday  year later planned. During the, pickup 4th pvs Endeavour's astronauts connected first two building blocks international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It was first time that Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked be perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced moment two pieces came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (Russian Sunrise) using shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came hard part: stacking two giant cylinders cargo bay. The two station pieces are so big  77 feet tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pounds  that Currie and her crewmates had rely computerized vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. This was first time such blind docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inches directly Unity. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, and brief burst raised shuttle and thereby Unity enough docking mechanisms two station components snap together. The historical moment occurred South Pacific. The union  intended last station's 15-year or more lifetime  set stage spacewalk two astronauts Monday attach electrical connectors and cables two components. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer planned and gave six astronauts plenty time tasks. But everything occurred more or less when and how it was supposed to, aside piece space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach Zarya, six astronauts had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five miles orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, was Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never handled object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that was launched Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana called that two antennas module were still undeployed Russian flight controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be needed next summer, officials said. The only other problem was Zarya battery; astronauts took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future modules. It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connections two modules install handrails and other tools future crews. The joined modules will be released Endeavour once all work is completed. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be longer football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts. Russian space officials gave first module international space station routine tweak Saturday push it higher orbit, and convened meeting Earth map out its future. Flight controllers fired one module's two maneuvering engines raise it orbit 230 kilometers (157 miles) space, station's public affairs office said. Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters maneuver was carried out great accuracy, and 24-ton core module was cruising space any problems. The module, called Zarya, or Sunrise, lifted Friday Baikonur launchpad Kazakstan initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth. Zarya is serve space tugboat early stages international project, providing propulsion, power and communications. It will fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavour, which is be launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The international space station is U.S.-led successor Russia's Mir space station, and is being heralded space officials vehicle unprecedented international cooperation space 21st century. The heads space agencies United States, Russia, Japan and Canada, European Space Agency, met Moscow Saturday discuss project, Interfax news agency reported. The space agency heads agreed schedule future meetings and holding scientific conference project somewhere Europe, unspecified date. Also Saturday, head Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, was quoted saying that Russia would take lead role managing international space station its first five years. Previously, space officials have said station would be jointly controlled Moscow and Houston, U.S. space agency NASA taking lead role. According Interfax, Lobachev said it made sense Russia control project because Russian-built Zarya and Russian-built service module would perform most life support and navigational functions station's first five years. Furthermore, Russian engineers are more experienced this job and NASA officials are aware this, he said. The space station is expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, which United States is expected pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problems delayed initial launch year, and some critics have said station amounts expensive way NASA keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive. The station will serve orbital home visiting astronauts and cosmonauts least 15 years.

Russian space experts were making final preparations Thursday Baikonur rocket base launch first component multibillion dollar international space station year delay. Built Russian company and be launched atop Russian booster rocket, 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is U.S.-funded component station. It will serve space tugboat early stages project, providing propulsion, power and communications. The unmanned launch, set 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday Baikonur Kazakhstan, has been delayed one year mainly because cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure complete another part station. After years discussing, planning and replanning, we are launch hardware, Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator new station, said news conference earlier this week. We are ready begin project that will bring us millennium women and men living and working space permanently. Russian officials added their traditional note superstition. It is not Russian tradition preface launch ... some advance statements. I would knock wood, which is rather common Russian tradition, said Alexander Krasnov, deputy chief Russian Space Agency's manned flight department. The station, involving 16 nations United States and Russia playing biggest roles, will consist more 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights complete. It is due be completed 2004. The station will weigh 500 tons (more million pounds) and is expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States planning pay dlrs 21 billion. It will serve orbital home visiting astronauts and cosmonauts 20 years. Zarya is fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, which is be launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew will attach two modules together three space walks, using Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya holds more 6 tons fuel its 16 tanks and is capable flying independently 430 days. Its control system consists 36 thrusters and two large engines major orbital changes. It will be launched three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket that would put Zarya orbit less 10 minutes blastoff. In ensuing days, ground controllers will gradually adjust its orbit preparation meeting Endeavor. The space station will not be inhabitable early 2000, launch Russian crew module which is set blast next July or August. Russia has repeatedly failed meet deadlines constructing crew module, putting whole project schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government funds, Russian space agency has sold its early research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev said that taking part new station is only hope beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding has collapsed Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia keep 80,000 jobs next 15 years. Koptev assailed some Russian space engineers who continue insist that more money should be put Russia's battered 12-year old Mir space station extend its lifetime instead committing more funds new space outpost. The choice mustn't be determined emotions. Some people are glued one thing (Mir) and don't care rest, Koptev said recent news conference. We must proceed understanding what would take us future, allow us preserve our industry. The Russian Khrunichev company has earned dlrs 200 million building Zarya, whose design was based earlier Soviet spacecraft, including some Mir's six modules. WASHINGTON  NASA and Russian Space Agency have agreed set aside last-minute Russian request launch international space station orbit closer Mir, officials announced Friday. While putting new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier transfer equipment and supplies old outpost new one, request came too late be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA was surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hours match orbits would have forced similar shifts subsequent assembly flights, and resulted potentially unfavorable sun angles solar-powered station, engineers said. We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent make these changes, Brinkley said news conference held Johnson Space Center Houston. It added technical complexity and risks mission that were not justified. The decision, which followed frank and candid discussions two partners, was not imposed United States, he said. The conclusions were mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides concluded that it not make sense. The Russians, struggling find money their space program their nation economic collapse, had said they wanted transfer thousands pounds newer equipment and scientific instruments Mir economy move. However, some critics questioned Russians' motives, wondering if requested orbital change was part plan delay decommissioning and destruction Mir, which Russians have agreed do next summer. The Russians have so little money that United States and other partners international station fear that money spent Mir will prevent Russia meeting its obligations new project. The Mir competes international space station very critical resources and funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider ideas salvaging Mir's research equipment use international space station, he said, only if it does not interfere assembling new station. The United States and 15 other nations plan begin building new station orbit next week when Russians launch module that will supply power and propulsion early stages five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor is follow Dec. 3 second station part, U.S.-built connecting passageway that attaches first module. The first piece international space station was orbiting Earth Friday, sprouting antennae and unfolding solar power panels it awaited other segments, which will eventually grow largest orbital laboratory history. The module, called Zarya Russian term meaning sunrise or dawn, took flawless ride space atop three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket that lifted 1:40 a.m. Eastern time Baikonur cosmodrome Kazakhstan. The launching was witnessed heads space agencies 16 nations that are sponsoring station, which will cost least $40 billion build next five years. Zarya, built Russia $240 million United States, is be joined two weeks first American module, docking hub called Unity. The space shuttle Endeavour is take Dec. 3 rendezvous Zarya and attach two units. This is be followed 43 more flights American and Russian rockets carrying more 100 parts be assembled space form 900,000-pound research station housing seven astronauts. Daniel Goldin, administrator NASA, said news conference launching, Now we only have 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks and countless problems. But because all partner nations trusting each other and working together, he said, international space station is going be reality. Even new space station is coming together, questions continue fate Russia's existing space laboratory, 12-year-old Mir. Because collapse Russian economy, doubts that Russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment support projects led Russia promise that it would abandon Mir and destroy station next summer. However, recent weeks Russian officials have been lobbying find ways extend Mir's life. According report news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday he was preparing number proposals extending Mir's life year 2000. Support such options has been growing recent weeks Russian space officials, astronauts and nationalists, who see Mir symbol Russian achievements space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager operations space station, said Friday that agency had not received any formal proposals extending Mir's life. NASA would find such proposal unacceptable if it has any measurable impact international space station, Van Laak said telephone interview Johnson Space Center Houston, No one has any objection Mir or keeping it operational if Russians find way support projects, they have demonstrate they can. Yuri Koptev, head Russian Space Agency, said launching Zarya, 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion early stages station construction, was needed vindication troubled Russian space program. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able fulfill all its commitments international space station, Koptev said. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried first part international space station orbit Friday, heralding start new era international space colonization. Russian space officials and cheered ground control announced that capsule had separated its booster rocket and reached its first orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth. Success, shouted one exultant official some 10 minutes giant rocket blasted and entered orbit. The heads space agencies 16 nations participating project watched lift-off distance 5 kilometers (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had prepared launch were underground bunkers avoid poisoning highly toxic rocket fuel. Russian and U.S. officials said launch was flawless and module performed well initial tests. They cautioned that much work remains be done get ambitious space station project and working. Now we only have 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks and countless problems, because trust and mutual respect ... international space station is going be reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin told press conference launch. His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said launch was vital vindication troubled Russian space industry, proving it could play major role space operations. Today we made truly epoch-making step carry out this project. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able fulfill all its commitments international space station, he said. The launch went smoothly, rocket soaring cloudy sky central Asian steppes. The huge roar rocket reverberated dozens kilometers (miles) empty plain base. The mood launch pad was tense launch, space officials and workers anxiously making last-minute checks ensure there were no problems. Solar power panels module were successfully deployed shortly it reached its first orbit and all systems were working normally, officials said. The launch Russian cargo module, which had been delayed more year, ushers new era cooperation former space-race rivals. Space officials expressed optimism that cooperation would further promote world stability end Cold War. We still have some contradictions, we still have combat missiles aimed each other, predominant trend is state cooperation and doing things together, said Yuri Semyonov Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, was launched three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya is designed serve space tugboat early stages project, providing propulsion, power and communications. Engineers finished final preparations early Friday liftoff 24-ton module. The rocket blasted cloudy skies and strong winds, and disappeared clouds 40 seconds later. The international space station, U.S.-led successor Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due be completed 2004. It will consist more 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights complete. Russia's crucial participation has been hampered country's financial problems. The launch first segment was postponed repeatedly, mainly because chronically broke Russian space agency couldn't afford complete another part station that is go later. Zarya is fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, which is be launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The space station will not be inhabitable least early 2000, launch Russian crew module which is set blast next July or August. The space station is expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States planning pay dlrs 24 billion. It will serve orbital home visiting astronauts and cosmonauts least 15 years. Russia has repeatedly failed meet deadlines constructing crew module, putting whole project schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government funds, Russian space agency has sold research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Russia rents Baikonur launching pad Kazakstan. Endeavour and its astronauts closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module that had be connected Unity chamber shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinders 240 miles Earth was considered most difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station pieces are so big  77 feet tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pounds  that Currie and her crewmates were going have rely computerized vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking had never been attempted before. Mission Control gave astronauts plenty time tasks. The main thing I've tried do last two years working this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning their final approach Zarya  Russian Sunrise  shuttle's six astronauts had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five miles orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, was Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never been assigned handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that was launched Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future modules. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have manually fit them together. The astronauts would be going out anyway Monday attach electrical connectors and cables two components. In all, three spacewalks were planned Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be longer football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts. Two astronauts ventured back out another spacewalk Wednesday attach antennas international space station construction nearly 250 miles Earth. For second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman floated out hatch shuttle Endeavour work seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape open cargo bay. Their No. 1 priority was attach two 100-pound antennas Unity, American-made side space station. Their other job, time permitting, was trickier: trying open stuck antenna Zarya, Russian-built control module. The planned seven-hour spacewalk was not nearly difficult or crucial Monday night's outing, which Ross and Newman hooked 40 electrical connections Zarya and Unity. The plan called men lug two suitcase-size antennas halfway Unity and install them sides 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, antennas will provide direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link Unity and NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would have rely sporadic coverage provided Russian ground stations. The electronic and computer hookups antennas will be made Unity Thursday, entire crew enters orbiting station first time. Other spacewalking chores Ross and Newman Wednesday evening included erecting sunshade computer mounted Unity. Mission Control decided just spacewalk let Newman take crack unjamming Zarya antenna. Flight controllers urged caution. The antenna was rolled spool, and engineers worried 3-foot strip might pop open enough force hurt him if he got too close. Newman had 10-foot grappling hook job. The antenna is one two that failed open properly Zarya's Nov. 20 launch Kazakstan. One more spacewalk is planned Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct photo survey and take out sack tools that will be used future station visitors. Newman also may try unjam other Zarya antenna. This was sixth spacewalk Ross his 18-year NASA career, most American, and third Newman. ",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."
48,"Caught middle economic crisis, many Brazilian factories fear they won't be able pay their workers mandatory year-end bonus. So they're paying products instead cash. Some workplaces have already offered their employees such things hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead traditional cash bonus that normally is equivalent one month's wage, said head Brazil's largest federation trade unions. The idea is completely unacceptable, said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general federation, which represents more 2,000 unions and 19 million workers. We will recommend our unions reject such preposterous proposal. But strapped cash and punished high interest rates and declining sales, factory owners may have no other choice, said Joseph Curi, president Sao Paulo State Association Small Industries, which represents 110,000 factories that employ nearly 800,000 workers. Access credit is almost impossible, Curi said. If banks and government don't create some kind emergency credit line, only option many our associates will have will be use products pay bonus. Factories that produce clothes, shoes, food, toys and household appliances were most enthusiastic idea, Curi said. Curi predicted harsher times Brazil belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected announce Tuesday. The measures, aimed curbing country's ballooning budget deficit  equal 7 percent gross domestic product  are expected include spending cuts and, possibly, more taxes. There is lot talk increasing taxes, which means less cash circulating market and more credit restrictions, Curi said. It is shortsighted approach that will spell more recession and collapse many small factories. Brazil has been major casualty global economic crisis, buffeted loss investor confidence and strong outflow capital. The country's foreign reserves have fallen dlrs 50 billion, dlrs 70 billion end July. In effort prevent collapse nation's currency, real, and stem capital flight, interest rates were hiked 50 percent year. For union leader Felicio, proposed product-for-cash swap is clear sign despair business sector is feeling because recessive economic policies brought Real Plan, economic stabilization program put together 1994 when Cardoso was finance minister. The plan succeeded slashing inflation 2,400 percent almost zero today. But it also brought recession and unemployment, which now stands almost 8 percent, highest decade. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts repair largest economy Latin America may depend outcome this weekend's gubernatorial elections. Cardoso wants impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes try halt slide Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. But his plan, expected be unveiled next week, must be approved Congress, and state governors have enormous sway local delegations. The influence governors have their congressional blocs is overwhelming, said University Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas. Brazil has been caught financial turmoil that began more year ago Southeast Asia. As wary investors have fled its financial markets, Brazil's foreign reserves have fallen dlrs 50 billion dlrs 70 billion end July. On Sunday, voters return polls runoff elections 12 states and Federal District Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how successful Cardoso is getting Congress approve his economic program, which is aimed trimming budget deficit. New income, fuel and bank transaction taxes are expected be proposed. Kugelmas said opponents president stand good chance winning four large states  Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. If they win, president will face tough uphill battle, he said. Cardoso needs governors' support not only influencing congressional delegations, also holding their spending. The problem is that none candidates Sunday's elections ... wants be identified unpopular austerity measures, said Kugelmas. So they promise spend more money schools, hospitals and public work projects. Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is perhaps state most critical success Cardoso's austerity plans. With more 34 million inhabitants, nearly equal entire population neighboring Argentina, it alone accounts more one-third Brazil's economic output and 70 513 congressional seats. While incumbent governor Mario Covas, Cardoso ally who is seeking re-election, has committed himself austerity plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is question mark. If Maluf wins, he will use his victory launching pad presidency 2003, Kugelmas predicted. And that means he will try stay far away possible any austerity measure. Brazil and International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday agreement expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package world's ninth-largest economy. A joint statement IMF and Brazilian government said two sides agreed Brazil should aim reduce its budget deficit expected eight percent gross domestic product zero 2000. The statement was issued weekend talks IMF officials and Brazilian delegation headed Pedro Parente, executive secretary Finance Ministry. Representatives World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank took part talks. Both organizations well private banks are expected contribute rescue package. Brazil is latest country be hit financial crisis that began 15 months ago Asia and then spread Russia. Brazil has lost dlrs 25 billion foreign currency reserves August when Russia defaulted its debts and sparked new crisis confidence emerging market countries. If instability continues Brazil it could affect Argentina, its main trading partner, and other Latin American economies. Despite re-election Fernando Henrique Cardoso second term president and announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and IMF had agreed broad outlines financial assistance package, investors continued withdraw large sums money Brazil. Cardoso is preparing emergency program budget cuts restore investor confidence and prevent devaluation country's currency. Investors want Cardoso outline plans this week he is expected wait Sunday's second elections state governors, whose support he needs his budget cuts. The joint statement said Brazil-IMF discussions were aimed preparing ground prompt support international community, including IMF, multi-year fiscal program be announced soon Brazilian authorities, which will include new policy initiatives. The statement reiterated Brazil's goal achieving primary budget surplus 2.6 percent its gross domestic product 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 and 3.0 percent 2001 which would  fulfill government target stabilizing ratio net consolidated public sector debt GDP year 2000. The two sides are continue their talks objective reaching early agreement, statement said. There's no such thing free lunch any longer Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either. Eager bolster sagging economy, Cardoso wants slash dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion reals) budget deficit, and he's beginning paring perks more 2,000 workers presidential palace Brasilia, capital. Sure, it's not much when compared deficit some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent economic output. But Cardoso readies package spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants show Brazilians that economy starts home. So goodbye afternoon courtesy snack sandwiches, fruit and juice, palace tradition. Three barber shops palace were closed, and use cellular phones and copiers was restricted. The price buffet offered employees lunch was raised dlrs 6 dlrs 8.50 (7 reals 10 reals). Cardoso himself has promised travel less and more cheaply. On trip summit Portugal this month, he took delegation just eight, half usual number. The savings palace could come nearly dlrs 145,000 (170,000 reals) month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator president's office. Cardoso, pressure repair economy battered world financial turmoil, is expected unveil full scope his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed include spate new taxes fuel, income, personal fortunes and bank transactions. The plan is part deal International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence world's ninth-largest economy, now center financial crisis buffeting developing nations more year. Brazil already has agreed annual targets sharply reduce its deficit year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers published joint statement Brazil and IMF, although final agreement hasn't been reached yet. Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians were less impressed palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party said government was making big deal insignificant savings while it failed cut other dubious projects, such dlrs 800,000 (1 million reals) moat being built Congress keep protesters easily entering building. The Globo TV network also suggested there still was plenty fat cut, citing government expenses running shoes, Persian carpets and gold cufflinks, intended presents visiting dignitaries. Cardoso is counting help friendly state governors control spending. But governors, some facing runoff elections Sunday, are promising pay raises and public works projects that could sink austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion (1.2 billion reals). Roriz hasn't explained where money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, government will almost certainly have lay workers  state payroll consumes 78 percent budget. To rein free-spending habits provincial politicians, Cardoso reportedly wants hold local governments bimonthly limits spending. Federal money would automatically be cut if spending gets out hand. Latin American leaders flew Friday Portugal weekend summit figure out how they can shield their economies global financial crisis. Not early 1980s have so many countries been recession, and crisis now threatens cripple Latin America's developing economies. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described turmoil world financial markets most important issue facing world moment. I don't know if we are coming end world economic order. It will be interesting know, Cuban leader said hotel press conference shortly his arrival annual Ibero-American summit. Emphasizing scale threat, Castro said President Clinton was aware that if South America falls crisis, it will be extended inevitably also United States, which is heavily involved investments and loans region. Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash out Latin America devastating effects stock markets and currency reserves. The heads state and government Latin America, Spain and Portugal will explore measures ward financial turmoil that already has devastated Asia and Russia. Stock markets also fell Portugal and Spain, heavy investors Latin America. The Latin American leaders must gauge need unpopular reforms their public finances, including austerity packages which risk social unrest and political upheaval. A joint declaration will be signed Sunday this ancient port city Douro River northern Portugal. Diplomats said there was consensus form final statement. The declaration calls international community, and Group Seven countries particular, take necessary measures promote stability international financial markets, which is necessary condition sustained economic growth, said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin America's leaders favor creating some kind regulatory system global financial transactions that would place controls speculators, measures slow internatioal flow money. They also want reforms that allow international financial institutions head crises rather react them rescue packages. International institutions must be active tackling crises recent one ... and contribute stability, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said. Countries that have progressive policies should not be penalized, they should be given incentives, Gama added reference Latin American nations' efforts modernize their economies. Brazil, continent's largest economy and potential bulwark creeping recession, is waiting news dlrs 30 billion bailout package International Monetary Fund. The presidents World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank also were expected talks. The move U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates Thursday revived Latin America's financial markets, analysts expected reprieve be short-lived because deep concerns continent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stemmed part structural weaknesses Latin American economies. A strike being waged state employees Colombia government austerity package offers glimpse trouble that could arise if tough reforms are introduced. Brazil is drafting austerity package that will hit public spending, especially social security. Brazilian officials ended four days meetings representatives International Monetary Fund Tuesday living their public pledge announce concrete measures reduce government deficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only details Brazil's plans raising primary account surplus next three years. With only five days go gubernatorial runoffs Sunday, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brasilia, said how government planned achieve savings. Important allies Cardoso are lagging three key states, and government promises, market analysts not expect announcement elections. Instead, strategy Brasilia and Washington appeared focus reassuring markets that work cutting deficit was going forward, providing fodder opponents domestic elections. The discussions continue objective reaching agreement soon detailed program, said joint statement IMF and Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because Brazil's enormous deficits, collapse emerging markets has hit nation particularly hard, draining foreign currency reserves and pushing economy recession. Finance officials Washington and world fear that collapse Brazil, because its size and links other economies, would worsen financial instability throughout hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represents world's ninth-largest economy and is financial engine Latin America. Throughout day, government officials met Cardoso Brasilia and were expected fine-tune three-year austerity package that Cardoso was discuss congressional party leaders Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, officials said that measures being considered were tax increase financial transactions, three-tenths percent two-tenths percent, and extending Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which sets aside 20 percent all taxes collected presidential discretionary spending. The fund was have expired 1999. Speaking Washington, Parente said that Brazil would aim surplus 2.6 percent 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 and 3 percent 2001. It had already been announced, end IMF's annual meeting Washington two weeks ago that Brazil would have reach primary account surplus 2.5 percent 3 percent qualify IMF aid. The primary account covers government expenses, interest payments debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist Latin America Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said signs that Brazilian government and IMF were moving closer aid package were reassuring, and that he not expect much more reassurance next week. I call this `We have pope' scenario, Brown said. You're just going hear that we have pope, maybe see white smoke rising, he said, and not figure out who pope is elections. The United States is preparing commit U.S. taxpayer funds part lending program least $30 billion try insulate Brazil, and it rest Latin America, worst effects financial turmoil circling globe, according U.S. and foreign officials assembling program. Details U.S. contribution, which is expected total several billion dollars direct aid or loan guarantees, have be negotiated. But several congressional leaders have been alerted likelihood that administration would have act while Congress is recess. This early warning administration reflects memories how Congress erupted objections and hearings 1995 when President Clinton committed $20 billion U.S. funds bailout Mexico. But administration officials said last week that their early soundings indicate that members Congress are deeply concerned preventing economic collapse Latin America that would resound United States, and thus they expect few objections. The timing aid package Brazil  originally expected next few days  is complicated unexpected delays that have cropped dealing Brazilian government. The government President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces politically risky gubernatorial elections Sunday, which may well determine whether Brazil can execute austerity program that is key condition loans it is concurrently negotiating International Monetary Fund. The biggest role rescue program Brazil will be taken International Monetary Fund, which said last week that it would contribute least $15 billion  and appears be pressure United States do more. Another $9 billion or so will come World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, and remainder United States and other major industrial nations. Germany and Japan, though, have been reluctant take part, one U.S. official noted, suggesting that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. So far, U.S. officials working scenes organize aid package have said nothing public details plans direct contribution Brazil. Brazil is very important economic well-being region, United States and international community, and all us are very much focused seeing how we can be helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Friday. But wide-ranging interview global economic turmoil, Rubin declined say what strategy he would pursue dealing Brazil's problems and insisted that no decisions had been made how United States might contribute. But he discussed Brazil opportunity engage kind preventive financial diplomacy that President Clinton advocated speeches IMF and World Bank here three weeks ago. At time, Clinton argued that monetary fund should provide contingent finance help countries ward global financial contagion rather wait disaster strike. Direct U.S. aid Brazil would clearly send symbolic message: that year trying manage financial crisis monetary fund, United States is now ready put limited amount its capital risk prevent further havoc  not only Brazil stop chaos spreading Argentina, Mexico and other countries that are major U.S. trading partners. That would be change strategy. So far, United States has operated almost entirely international financial institutions, chiefly IMF But it would also be risky move President Clinton, economically and politically. Even though Congress objected $20 billion U.S. funds committed bailout Mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion was ultimately needed, and it has been paid back, interest. But Rubin noted Friday that it's very different environment now. Other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections Congress direct U.S. participation Brazil bailout. I think there are lot more people Congress who are now scared death what's been happening markets, and what could happen their districts, White House official said last week, and they won't say much long they don't have vote it. By acting soon stabilize Latin America, administration is hoping capitalize two weeks relative calm late-summer panic that engulfed Russia and, its height, led outflow billion dollars day Brazil, fear that it would be next country forced devalue its currency. Whether this calm marks beginning turnaround or just another pause wildfires that have erupted Thailand's currency crisis July 1997 is matter considerable debate. But many experts cite confluence several events that have reassured jittery investors world: two successive interest-rate cuts United States, Japan's long-delayed move prop its banking system $500 billion taxpayer funds, and steady strengthening currencies Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, first signs that investors may be preparing return. Always circumspect when it comes commenting publicly markets, Rubin acknowledged that last several weeks there have been number significant, positive developments. But former trader, burned 26-year career many false market rallies, warned that serious issues remain and that it will take some time world work its way out what he has repeatedly called most serious international financial disruption last 50 years. In fact, Rubin's aides are clearly nervous possibility another outbreak that could set new panic, which has made it virtually impossible many emerging-market countries borrow money world markets. Brazil and Japan are two obvious tinderboxes, said Jeffrey Garten, dean Yale School Management, who served undersecretary commerce international affairs Clinton's first term. In Brazil, issue is whether package that is coming together will really be big enough deal exploding debt problem. And Japan question is whether there is real reform that goes money. But spending 18 months negotiations Japanese, Rubin clearly senses that United States has little leverage Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted political gridlock, not lack resources. In Brazil, though, United States has better chance buying time and influencing economic reform program, long it does not appear be dictating terms publicly Cardoso and his team. But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping Exchange Stabilization Fund, created Roosevelt administration help stabilize dollar. The money is Rubin's control, presidential approval, and he reached it circumvent congressional objections aiding Mexico 1995. But reaction was so strong  time Congress restricted tapping fund international bailouts  that Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since. He committed $3 billion second line defense emergency aid programs Indonesia and South Korea last year, no money was ultimately dispersed either country. U.S. officials said that South Korea not need extra help, and that collapse Suharto government Indonesia so changed political scene there that it would be too risky offer direct U.S. aid. In bailout Russia  whose economy collapsed President Boris Yeltsin abandoned agreement reform economy and dismissed leading reformers  United States offered no direct help. Those events set panicked exit investors all emerging markets, and greatly worsened Brazil's troubles. So far, Brazilian officials have successfully calmed market constantly talking forthcoming aid program IMF, convincing speculators that it would be dangerous bet country. But same time, Brazilian officials have maintained pose that they do not really need cash  and are certainly no hurry get it. U.S. officials and top officials IMF are clearly nervous, worried that longer negotiations drag on, greater will be risk Brazil being caught another market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone think that it's all control, said investment banker involved talks. But fact is that there's still real risk that sometime next 18 months government is going be forced devalue its currency, which is pegged dollar, adjusts 7.5 percent year carefully controlled fall. To prevent sudden devaluation, Brazilian government has had raise interest rates more 50 percent, choking credit most companies. Meanwhile, country is slipping recession. The aid would buy time Brazilians, it is contingent Cardoso's success persuading legislature end huge deficits, chiefly unpopular cuts social spending. The first deputy managing director International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday Brazil review country's austerity plan, which is expected be announced Sunday's elections international package, avoid appearance that global lender is dictating conditions Brazil. Brazil has do lot, Fischer said last week leaving his trip. In return, I expect international community will make large contribution. Leaders 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing touches Saturday Ibero-American summit declaration warning global recession unless action is taken stabilize international financial system. The draft declaration said recent financial market turmoil shows that adjustments must be made quickly keep difficulties affecting few becoming crisis all. The declaration addresses world's seven richest nations. The Group Seven is composed United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. The final declaration will be approved Sunday's summit this port city northern Portugal. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that Brazil and China, two world's largest economies, had become dikes resistance global recession. Protecting their economies spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more countries any time early 1980s, is key world economic stability, he said. Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and eighth-largest world, and its economic collapse could take rest continent it. To halt Brazil's slide recession, Cardoso is preparing austerity measures including spending cuts, tax hikes and lower interest rates. The reforms would help Brazil qualify International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated dlrs 30 billion. The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling dlrs 137 billion financial crisis struck Thailand 15 months ago and then spread Asia Russia. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, aware impact that Latin American recession would have United States, has actively pushed IMF and World Bank support Brazil it was hit investor flight. There's no such thing free lunch any longer Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either. Eager bolster sagging economy, Cardoso wants slash dlrs 19 billion budget deficit, and he's beginning paring perks more 2,000 workers presidential palace Brasilia, capital. Sure, it's not much when compared deficit some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent economic output. But Cardoso readies package spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants show Brazilians that economy starts home. So goodbye afternoon courtesy snack sandwiches, fruit and juice, palace tradition. Three barber shops palace were closed, and use cellular phones and copiers was restricted. The price buffet offered employees lunch was raised dlrs 6 dlrs 8.50. Cardoso himself has promised travel less and more cheaply. On trip summit Portugal this month, he took delegation just eight, half usual number. The savings palace could come nearly dlrs 145,000 month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator president's office. Cardoso, pressure repair economy battered world financial turmoil, is expected unveil full scope his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed include spate new taxes fuel, income, personal fortunes and bank transactions. The plan is part deal International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence world's ninth-largest economy, now center financial crisis buffeting developing nations more year. Brazil already has agreed annual targets sharply reduce its deficit year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers published joint statement Brazil and IMF, although final agreement hasn't been reached yet. Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians were less impressed palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party said government was making big deal insignificant savings while it failed cut other dubious projects, such dlrs 800,000 moat being built Congress keep protesters easily entering building. The Globo TV network also suggested there still was plenty fat cut, citing government expenses running shoes, Persian carpets and gold cufflinks, intended presents visiting dignitaries. Cardoso is counting help friendly state governors control spending. But governors, some facing runoff elections Sunday, are promising pay raises and public works projects that could sink austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion. Roriz hasn't explained where money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, government will almost certainly have lay workers  state payroll consumes 78 percent budget. To rein free-spending habits provincial politicians, Cardoso reportedly wants hold local governments bimonthly limits spending. Federal money would automatically be cut if spending gets out hand. The Commerce Department Tuesday provided concrete measure effects global economic downturn American economy, reporting that nation's trade deficit widened $2.2 billion August $16.77 billion. That is widest gap government recalculated way it measures trade flows 1992. It resulted decline American exports and sharp increase what this country buys abroad. So far this year, trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent last year's levels and is projected $170 billion year, gap that is expected widen further. One senior administration official who deals economic issues, speaking condition anonymity, said Tuesday that internal projections suggest that trade deficit 1999 could reach $300 billion, figure that he said will certainly cut growth, and could well become major political problem. Trade deficits carry them good and troubling signals economy. The current flood imports is helping contain inflation some lowest levels decades. And while sales American aircraft, computer chips and other goods are suffering, weakening dollar world markets recent weeks may provide end-of-the-year boost American exporters. But this moment global upheaval, biggest problem facing American companies is inability many nations and some large companies Asia and Latin America simply borrow money make ordinary purchases. The result is such freeze economic activity that empty shipping containers are stacking American piers. And effects are hurting everyone Midwest farmers who can no longer send wheat impoverished Russia, East Coast fishermen who are discovering that Japan's appetite salmon and lobster has been ruined banking crisis. Among most surprising elements Tuesday's report is that more third August's deficit was one country that so far has managed ward worst effects global troubles: China. Despite continued growth Chinese economy, exports China have slowed dramatically and imports Chinese-made goods have exploded, country desperately seeks sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere Asia. That increased monthly deficit Beijing $5.9 billion, levels previously only seen trade Japan. The Chinese  besieged floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and incipient banking crisis  have signaled United States recent weeks that they have little interest any swift moves open their markets further return entry World Trade Organization. That amounts major setback President Clinton, who three years has been using negotiations China's entry world body centerpiece his effort open China economically and politically. Ostensible progress this area has been cited administration recently one successes administration's China policy, now officials say privately that progress is evaporating. The decline exports will trim growth American economy, and it was one factor Federal Reserve's decision lower interest rates two times recent weeks. So administration officials were going out their way Tuesday portray numbers another warning sign, not crisis. While United States remains strong and sound, troubled condition global marketplace continue strongly influence U.S. trade balance, Commerce Secretary Williams Daley said statement Tuesday. After China, biggest deterioration American trade balance August came Mexico, where peso has weakened markedly economic contagion has spread Latin America. Exports Mexico have remained unchanged. But imports Mexico have increased markedly  chiefly automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment  American manufacturers have taken advantage weakening currency. In contrast, America's trade surplus Brazil, latest focus concern administration and International Monetary Fund, barely budged same period year ago. Normally, that would be cited sign continued demand American products Latin America's largest economy, there is fear it might be imperiled. The news comes United States and IMF complete bailout package $30 billion or more Brazil, intended help it stave kind economic troubles that have swept Asia, Russia and several other nations. Tuesday IMF and Brazil reached agreement country's fiscal targets this year and next, sign that aid will likely be announced elections Brazil this weekend. But all these potential problems, rising trade deficit has barely caused ripple Capitol Hill. Because rising level imports does not appear be triggering any unemployment here, subject has barely come races House and Senate country. The only exception has been regions where steel industry is strong. The major steel companies have charged recent weeks that Asian nations are dumping products American market prices well their costs. The Commerce Department has begun inquiry. The Commerce Department's numbers showed that deficit rose 15.3 percent $16.77 billion August, revised figure $14.55 billion July. The department said that resumption production General Motors Corp. last summer's strike may have increased size deficit's rise August, GM brought parts abroad. The deficit was highest Commerce Department began new method tracking trade information 1992. Exports, department said, fell three tenths 1 percent, $74.8 billion.

49,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday confronting North Korea suspected nuclear site, and he warned North's communist leaders not squander historic chance make lasting peace peninsula. President Kim Dae-jung, appearing Clinton news conference, pledged that his government would spare no effort supporting U.S. endeavor resolve nuclear question. He called full access U.S. inspectors North Korean underground facility and said North must constrain its development and exports missiles. On first two days South Korea, Clinton also held roundtable discussion business leaders hear their prescriptions putting nation's economy back track. Economics and security are Clinton's twin themes five-day Asia trip that began Japan. Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not certain that suspicious underground construction project North Korea is nuclear related. But he said North risks closing door cooperation if it refuses U.S. inspection site. It raises strong suspicion, Clinton said joint news conference Kim Blue House, presidential mansion overlooking capital. We need access it. The foundation U.S. efforts ease North Korea's decades-long hostility South is 1994 agreed framework which North halted its nuclear weapons program exchange Western commitment build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would be shattered if suspect site turned out be clandestine nuclear project. And that, turn, would jeopardize preliminary North-South peace talks that could produce treaty replace shaky armistice that ended Korean War 1953. Kim, who has moved South Korea sunshine policy engaging North Korea cultural and economic fronts, firmly said his government supports Clinton nuclear issue. We must require full access and ways ascertain nature and purposes construction site, Kim said. If it is, fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should demand immediate close down. He also said North must limit its missile development, citing great shock Japan when North Koreans test-fired missile its way Aug. 31. In dinner toast, Kim said that tensions, North Korea is cautiously noticeably taking measures increase interaction and cooperation South and North. And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle Asia's economic woes. I believe Asia will emerge this present crisis more prosperous, more stable, more democratic  thanks no small measure Korea's example. After state dinner, Clinton made surprise late-night stop concert Sejong Culture Center where his younger brother, Roger, and his band were performing. The president listened songs stage his brother introduced president very special person. The audience 2,000 people stood and applauded. In meetings this week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, U.S. officials were rebuffed their request see suspicious underground site, which American intelligence officials fear could be secret effort revive North's nuclear weapons program. U.S. spy satellite photos show thousands workers digging massive complex. U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman said Thursday Pyongyang talks that there was compelling evidence underground nuclear facility. But statement distributed U.S. Embassy here Saturday, Kartman backtracked, saying instead that United States lacks conclusive evidence site is nuclear facility. There is strong information that makes us suspicious, we lack conclusive evidence that intended purpose underground site is nuclear related and, if so, what type nuclear facility it might be, Kartman said, offering clarification his earlier remarks. Kim said his government would spare no effort supporting U.S. endeavor resolve nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied underground construction site has any nuclear purpose, and it has demanded dlrs 300 million payment proving that. In remarks Tokyo Friday, Clinton rejected idea compensation. Directing his remarks North Korea, Clinton noted significance new tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans North cruise ships  arrangement touted Kim sign North may be opening its 1950s Korean War enemy. To risk that kind cooperation  and progress America other issues  stonewalling suspected nuclear site is contrary North's long-term interests, he said. Nothing could ever be put that hole ground, given our defense partnership here, nothing could ever be put that hole ground that would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness, more those ships going there full people here, Clinton said. To underscore U.S. military commitment South Korea, Clinton was scheduled venture out capital Sunday visit U.S. Army troops training range north Seoul. He also planned address American troops Osan Air Base U-2 spy plane hangar. North Korea has demanded that United States pay hundreds millions dollars right inspect huge underground center that U.S. intelligence analysts fear houses nuclear-weapons program, Clinton administration officials said Wednesday. The United States rejected request meetings this week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, North Korean officials and U.S. government delegation. As we expected, North Koreans brought issue compensation, and we flatly rejected it, said State Department Spokesman James Rubin. Asked how much money North Koreans had demanded, Rubin said payment fee was so not possibility that I don't care get figures. Other administration officials said fee would have been hundreds millions dollars; one put it $300 million. The North Koreans have denied that complex, which is being built mountainside 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended be used nuclear weapons program. They have repeatedly said U.S. inspectors could visit site long Washington agreed pay large fee compensation what North Koreans describe administration's slander. The North Korean representative United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that United States could inspect site condition that when it is confirmed not be nuclear facility, United States should pay compensation slandering and defaming my country. U.S. intelligence agencies fear that building complex, North Korea may have decided abandon four-year-old agreement United States which North Korea pledged give its nuclear weapons program exchange billions dollars aid. The U.S. delegation, led Charles Kartman, President Clinton's special envoy North Korean issues, left Pyongyang Wednesday 12 hours negotiations three days team North Korean Foreign Ministry. The talks ended Clinton began trip Asia that will include visit South Korea, where issue North Korean construction site is expected be major topics discussed President Kim Dae-jung. Rubin said U.S. delegation North Korea had pressed access site. We told them that access site is essential, he said. We've expected that this would be difficult, and we told North Koreans, we've said before, that verbal assurances, they are wont give, are simply unacceptable. U.S. officials have said construction underground site may not have technically violated accord, because there is no evidence that North Korea has begun pouring cement new reactor or reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. But if United States determines that North Korea has revived its nuclear program, Rubin said, it would go entire letter and spirit objectives agreement, and it would affect viability agreement. The administration has expressed growing concern North Korea's intentions several provocative acts, including underground construction Yongbyon and test firing last August missile Japan. Last week Clinton named former Defense Secretary William Perry review U.S. policy North Korea. Administration officials say Perry is being asked study ways salvage 1994 nuclear agreement North Korea, which had been administration's proudest achievements foreign policy. North Korean news media Thursday said communist nation's military is full alert war United States if dispute nuclear inspections comes blows. The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported that North Korean soldiers and people all walks life were full alert war. North Korea typically sends out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enters high-stake talks Washington. The United States and North Korea are set resume talks Friday inspections underground North Korean site suspected being used produce nuclear weapons. KCNA broadcasts brimmed anti-American saber-rattling. Our People's Army will blow U.S. territory whole if United States starts war divided Korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong Chang Ryol was quoted saying Thursday. The general staff North Korean military accused Washington Wednesday pushing situation Korea brink war demanding inspections and talks aimed preventing Pyongyang developing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Under prevailing touch-and-go situation, Korean People's Army is now bracing itself fight U.S. imperialist aggressors, KCNA quoted Jong saying. The agency also quoted various party officials, plant managers, museum curators pledging thousandfold revenge or vowing arm themselves spirit human bombs and suicidal attack. Washington demands unconditional inspections North's underground project. But North Korea asked Washington pay dlrs 300 million right inspect site. Concerns that North Korea was developing long-range missiles capable striking all Japan and parts United States escalated when North Korea fired rocket Aug. 31. Believed be test its Taepo Dong missile, rocket flew Japan and landed Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military is world's fifth largest. It forms backbone North Korean government, leader Kim Jong Il ruling country head military. A congressman who visited remote parts North Korea last week said Saturday that food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions North Koreans might have starved death last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who has had longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo his return United States and showed photographs he had taken North Korean children patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores and other signs severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag what officials called substitute food being distributed government food station: dried leaves and straw, so coarse that cattle would normally turn away. They grind it powder and make it noodles, Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomachs, he said. North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulties, there have been sharply diverging assessments how serious these are. Some visitors United Nations and other organizations have said that food situation seems be bit better now year or two ago. Hall said that divergence might have arisen because North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem be slightly better his three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas where foreigners are not allowed visit, he added, overall situation is worse ever. Based visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasized that public health care had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants were holding patient while surgeons conducted stomach operation electric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienated would-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations has repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal has raised less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced that it was pulling its staff 13 North Korea because it feared that its aid was going politically connected rather most needy. North Korea does not release mortality figures or health statistics, Hall said that United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent North Korean children age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent all children are physically stunted. Hall said he thought that overall least 1 million people had died and that total was probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness which professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently published estimates suggesting that North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million and has fallen 21.23 million this year. That would be decline 320,000 three years, period when North Korea's population would have been expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figures, says that there simply is not enough hard information him estimate death toll famine. But he notes one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly not expand previous ones did, rather had just 687 delegates, same previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, eight years which it had been expected add several million people, is now back 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States has been supplying grain North Korea, strains are growing secret underground complex North that some experts worry may be heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warned last week that agreed framework that is basis its relations North Korea will be jeopardy unless North lets American experts visit underground complex and resolve their doubts. North Korea has said that it will show complex only if Washington promises that if complex is not nuclear one, it will pay vilifying us and impairing our prestige. Washington refuses pay, and North Korea is warning that standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand is open infringement our sovereignty and wanton interference our internal affairs, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facilities already feared. Without naming his source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had information that two underground facilities captured U.S. spy satellite photos may be nuclear plants. He said Parliament session that one them is believed already be producing plutonium and other would be able produce enough 10 nuclear bombs starting 2004. If true, assertion paints worse picture suspected North Korean nuclear activity already made public. Kim said he asked government's Unification Ministry issue earlier this week and was suspicious its answer. It was not sufficient or sincere, so I came suspect that government is trying hide truth, Kim said seven-page press release. U.S. and South Korean officials said August they had detected huge underground construction site mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast Yongbyon, country's main nuclear complex. The United States has said it suspects construction is nuclear-related, though it has no evidence. North Korea has denied it. Kim, lawmaker main opposition Grand National Party, said there may actually be two underground facilities not far Yongbyon complex. It was activity Yongbyon that prompted United States negotiate 1994 accord promising development two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments if North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development. At time, North Korea was believed have made enough plutonium one or two atomic bombs. The Yongbyon complex, which houses 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, has been frozen 1994 accord. Kim said Friday that one new facility is already operating and other is construction and will be operational four six years. We estimate that reactor will go on-line 2002 or 2003, enabling production enough plutonium build one nuclear weapon six 12 months, Kim said. North Korea would be able make sufficient plutonium make eight 10 nuclear weapons every year that. North Korea has said underground construction is civilian use and not nuclear-related. It has offered open facility U.S. inspectors, says Washington must pay compensation if facility is been proven be civilian use. President Clinton made unusual, direct appeal North Korea Saturday set aside any nuclear ambitions favor strengthening ties South Korea and United States. The appeal came meeting reporters which he also counseled patience Iraq's refusal comply request weapons inspectors. I think it's important that we not overreact here first day, Clinton said response reports that Iraq had balked request U.N. inspectors documents its weapons program. But, speaking joint appearance South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton called requested documents quite important and said Iraq had some affirmative obligations help weapons inspectors. Aides Clinton denied that his comments represented any softening Iraq. They said that because situation was still developing and president was preparing meetings Kim he had not been briefed detail Iraq's resistance when he appeared reporters Saturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said administration was consulting other members U.N. Security Council matter. If Iraq fails meet its obligations U.N. resolutions, he said, We obviously are prepared act. Last weekend, Clinton called strike Iraq minutes it was begin, delayed his departure Asia monitor crisis and said that U.S. forces remained poised strike if Iraq reneged its agreement let U.N. weapons inspectors do their work. In his appearance Kim, president addressed handful questions that ranged North Korea Indonesia whether Congress should punish him Lewinsky scandal. Before leaving Washington this five-day trip Japan, Korea and Guam, he drew parallel governments Iraq and North Korea, saying, We must be no less concerned North Korea's weapons activities. The Clinton administration is urgently seeking inspect vast construction site North Korea that it believes may be beginnings nuclear weapons plant. Saturday, Clinton called that site, together North Korea's test firing August missile Japan, cause deep concern. But Clinton administration is trying very different approach North Korea Iraq, partly urging Kim, who is pursuing sunshine policy engagement North. As Clinton and Kim delivered prepared statements and answered questions Saturday, Clinton became most animated describing what he called very beautiful picture that he happened spot turning his hotel television arriving Seoul Friday night: film cruise ship recently permitted carry South Koreans tour North. I ask North Koreans think this, he said, arguing that Kim's policy engagement North presented them great opportunity. Nothing could ever be put that hole ground that would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness more those ships going there full people here. The Clinton administration fears that construction site may be evidence that North Korea has abandoned 1994 pledge United States give its nuclear weapons program exchange billions dollars aid. The North Koreans have denied that complex is intended help build nuclear weapons. But they have demanded that United States pay $300 million inspect it, request rejected this week U.S. delegation Pyongyang, North Korean capital. The new complex is being built mountainside 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, former North Korean nuclear research center. Kim continued Saturday emphasize his hopes new opening North Korea. But he said, We will not tolerate any possible attempt North Korea proliferate nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons mass destruction. The Clinton administration plans resume negotiating North Korea inspecting site December. In addition strategies easing Asian financial crisis, Clinton discussed North Korea visit Tokyo Thursday and Friday. The subject North Korea consumed most his two hours meetings Kim here Saturday Blue House, which contains Korean president's office and home. The administration has been criticized Congress and this region letting its policy North Korea drift, Clinton called that policy clear-eyed mix diplomacy and deterrence. He said that so far 1994 agreement had worked, because it North Korea already would have produced sizable amount weapons-grade plutonium. Under pressure congressional critics, Clinton last week appointed William Perry, his former defense secretary, review his policy North Korea. On other matters, Clinton declined criticize government Indonesia using force crack protesters there, saying that he not have enough facts this moment give you right answer. But he said he hoped there would be no backsliding Indonesia. Clinton followed his appearance Kim visit National Folk Museum here, where he conducted hourlong conversation six Korean academics, businessmen and union leaders troubled state Korea's economy and its impact society. He attended state dinner Saturday night, stopping concert where his brother, Roger, musician, happened be performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim his efforts economic reform, noting that interest rates had fallen here and currency had stabilized. But he also pressed Kim their private meetings restructure five huge conglomerates, or chaebols, that account some 40 percent Korean economy. In describing leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring chaebols perhaps most serious remaining problem South Korean economy. Clinton said economic forum Saturday afternoon that he felt impatient South Korea's failure act chaebols. It may be necessary proceed slowly restructuring, he said, they should begin. On Sunday, Clinton plans visit some 37,000 American troops stationed here. In green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troops stationed South Korea. He promoted private, sang birthday greetings sergeant major and described threats his hopes peaceful engagement North Korea. Lately, signs danger have intensified, Clinton said address airmen here, standing gunmetal gray F-16 and A-10 parked nose-to-nose. So we must remain vigilant. And thanks you, we are. For all his eagerness talk information-age economic dangers quicksilver currency flows, Clinton has returned again and again his five-day trip Japan and South Korea old-style regional military threat posed North Korea. The subject consumed most his meetings President Kim Dae-jung South Korea Saturday and formed backdrop his visits troops Sunday. It's kind tense here, said John Kelley, 26-year-old airman Wisconsin, describing life this base. You know you're only four minutes away missile. In his speech, Clinton pointed recent North Korean missile tests, incursions south and mysterious underground site that may be nuclear weapons installation signs potential threat. And he compared North Korea Iraq, saying that North Korea was also major concern because its chemical and biological weapons. Until North Korea fully commits itself constructive role this peninsula, he said, we must remain ready. Clinton restated his support Kim's policy engagement North Korea, though, saying that there were some hopeful signs justify it. He pointed talks that began summer American military command Korea and North Korean military prevent problems demilitarized zone south and north. Clinton planned leave South Korea early Monday and return Washington Monday night, paying visit Guam. On bright icy afternoon, Clinton was warmly received here soldiers camouflage and black boots, some whom waited almost three hours, shifting foot foot and rubbing their hands. The official crowd estimate was only 3,500, turnout seemed smaller. The base, 30 miles south Seoul, is one two major American airfields Korea, housing 7,500 airmen. Others who wanted see president were bused sites that are hours away. Before flying here helicopter, Clinton attended church Army base Seoul, then visited firing range just 12 miles demilitarized zone. In brief ceremony there, he promoted Matt Prickett West Liberty, Ohio, private first class specialist. And he led troops Happy Birthday Sgt. Maj. Charles Thomas Wilson, N.C., who turned 45 Sunday. It definitely caught me guard, Thomas said.

On darker note, he mentioned recent tensions Asian steel exports United States, which have skyrocketed this year great cost domestic U.S. steelmakers. Japanese steel is biggest problem, South Korean steel exports also are rise. Clinton said U.S. economy could tolerate increased imports  if they are not concentrated just few industries, and if result is that Asian economies begin recover. We have be sensitive if price doing that is basically erase entire sector U.S. economy, Clinton said. North Korea has agreed receive U.S. delegation next month discuss American concerns construction vast underground complex that is widely feared house nuclear weapons program, State Department said Wednesday. The delegation, led Charles Kartman, will press access site, which American intelligence agencies believe could be centerpiece effort revive frozen nuclear arms program. We've made clear North Koreans that any attempt North Korea pursue nuclear weapons development program would be unacceptable, State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. The talks Pyongyang, capital, he added, are aimed completely satisfying U.S. concerns suspect construction. American intelligence agencies fear that building complex could be effort break out four-year-old pact which North Korea pledged give its nuclear-weapons program exchange billions dollars aid United States, South Korea and Japan. American officials have said spy satellites have recently photographed thousands North Koreans huge site 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, nuclear center where North Korea was believed have stockpiled enough plutonium 1994 accords build six or more bombs. Although they have not explained exactly why government is building complex, North Korean officials have denied that it would be used develop nuclear weapons. The official North Korean press agency said last week that government was building civilian underground structures which any `doubt' cannot be cast and suggested that American officials would be allowed inspect complex if they pressed access. If U.S. side persists inspecting our underground structures, press agency said, we can show it them. Rubin said United States had received no formal assurances that Kartman, American special envoy Korean nuclear issues, and his delegation would be allowed inspect site trip, which is begin Nov. 16. We are beginning discussion them which we will demand access, Rubin said. The history U.S.-North Korea discussions involves lengthy discussion process there is agreement our requirements. So we are not expecting walk one day and be able have access next. The trip was announced signs grow relative warming relations United States and North Korea. Representatives United States, China and two Koreas met recently Geneva and agreed steps reduce tension Korean Peninsula. In September United States pledged provide additional 300,000 tons grain North Korea, which has years been crippled severe food shortages. In addition White House disclosed that United States would provide more heavy fuel oil promised North Korea 1994 agreement, concerns that North Korea may intend revive its nuclear program. American officials have said activity Yongbyon may not have technically violated accord, because there is no evidence that North Korea has begun pouring cement new reactor or reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. This city has always kept unwritten list foreign leaders  dictators, unfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoying allies  who it thinks can make enormous contribution peace, security or America's agenda taking early retirement, minimum. In 1950s, leftist leaders Iran and Guatamala made Top 10, '60s it was populated Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon and his advisers infamously agreed secret meeting '70s that best way deal government Salvador Allende Gossens Chile was make economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, has discouraged shouting America's enemies list White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy isn't personalities, right? But last week, driven frustration, or anxiety, or perhaps lure sounding tough cameras, Clinton administration piped up, twice. In very different situations, corners world, United States spoke loudly because it can't find stick. Sunday, hours he called attack Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered obvious, that focus U.S. policy Iraq is removal President Saddam Hussein  what Clinton called supporting forces change Iraq. No matter that covert efforts do just that have failed miserably. The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used his visit Malaysia Asian economic summit meeting throw U.S. support protesters calling reformasi, code word streets Kuala Lumpur dumping Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He has long been burr Washington's side, denouncing America, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently imprisoned his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who has suddenly become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir is no Saddam, not long shot. Gore's aides insist that his speech was call reform, not demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted that way. The New Zealanders called it megaphone diplomacy. The Malaysian government called it disgusting and interference internal affairs. Predictably, executives several U.S. companies that have flocked Kuala Lumpur told Malaysians that Gore was rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered words that needed be said. Whatever wisdom Gore's words, they raised question what it takes these days world's most powerful nation begin publicly suggesting that it's time nettlesome leader go. Because there is no official list, there are no real criteria getting it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, Kim Jong Il North Korea. President Clinton is spending weekend Korean Peninsula, staring demilitarized zone dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting break out its 1994 agreement freeze its nuclear weapons projects, return billions Western energy aid. Yet Washington has never called starving North Koreans revolt Kim's repressive regime. His government, taking page out Saddam playbook, suggested last week that if United States really wants look mountain tunnel that Pentagon believes is nuclear installation making, it should write check another $300 million. No one called Kim's removal when, few months ago, he lobbed three-stage missile Japan just show he knew how. The rules calling end regime are pretty murky, said Richard Feinberg, professor University California San Diego who served Clinton administration's first term. When they really want push someone out, it is because that country is part larger strategic concern time. But country itself doesn't have great strategic weight  it's another matter call change leadership Beijing or Moscow  and it helps if there is some kind domestic opposition that we can point to. Clinton's call Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely ripple because, all, he is proven murderer and avid stockpiler anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who was President George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week that Saddam nowadays is simply irritant, annoyance, pest and problem, not threat region moment). Mahathir, however, is far more complex case. He's prime example how opposing Washington's political and economic agenda interconnected world can move leader list authoritarians whom Washington tolerates list authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness. Like other Asian strongmen  Ferdinand Marcos Philippines and Suharto Indonesia come mind  he was useful when fear was that Malaysia would become communist domino. But he also seemed eminently tolerable long Cold War was over. He has never been accused enormous corruption. He turned his country model competitiveness, and Malaysia became exemplar big emerging markets that Clinton's Commerce Department touted things went sour last year. Sure, he was always prickly. But he is no terrorist or killer  U.S. companies have flocked his country, and say they want stay  and his iron control political discourse is no stronger neighboring Singapore. Just this summer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid him ostensibly friendly, if strained, visit and made no reference human rights. That all changed when Ibrahim was arrested and beaten jail. He has long been advocate Western-style solutions economic turmoil  more openness, more freedom  and protest movement Mahathir only surfaced once he was jail. Gore leapt that opportunity  particularly striking because, case Indonesia earlier this year, it took administration months come conclusion that President Suharto had go. He went.

50,"It was surprising scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera, one New York City's most left-leaning labor leaders, was singing praises Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president largest union New York City, praised D'Amato persuading Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, support legislation that financed health coverage hundreds thousands uninsured children. It looked if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato  or very minimum stay neutral this year's U.S. Senate race New York. But Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, National Health and Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement is risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because angering this powerful senator could make him far less responsive labor's needs when unions turn him help future if he is re-elected. Although it may seem illogical, two words go far explain why Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely result Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that Republicans will gain filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority Senate, where Republicans have 55 seats Democrats' 45. For labor leaders Rivera, notion strong Republican majority is nightmare. That fear has helped push other New York unions Schumer's column, though D'Amato had long courted them. Those unions include teamsters' joint council New York City and District Council 37, umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees. Labor leaders say they fear that filibuster-proof Republican majority, Senate would push anti-union legislation, recently defeated Republican proposals curb labor's political spending and cut financing National Labor Relations Board. We are worried legislation that will not allow labor movement survive next century, Rivera said. Alarmed that Democrats will lose Senate seats California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South Carolina, Rivera's union concluded that it was worth backing Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, was not personal was based national considerations. Unfortunately, leadership Republican Party national level person Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott are not necessarily same culture Republicans Northeast, he said. They're far more conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business. We fear that Democratic Party faces irrelevance United States Senate if we go 41 seats. Trying avoid rupture D'Amato, Rivera praised him effective senator. The endorsement could be boon Schumer. Rivera's union and teachers' union have labor's strongest political operations New York. In addition, Schumer will get thousands dollars local well use its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 political calls day. A spokesman D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud that he's been endorsed 100 union federations and locals, representing more that 400,000 working men and women, and he'll continue his efforts behalf working middle class families. His labor endorsements include New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. Besides backing 1199, Schumer also received endorsement 1199's parent union, Service Employees International Union, which has 350,000 members New York State. Rivera  who not support D'Amato last time he ran either  announced endorsements founding convention New York State Council service employees union. The convention packed Town Hall, and new group aims make service employees power be reckoned bringing together dozen union locals forge common political and legislative strategy. Earlier this year, 1199 merged service employees, and part that agreement, Rivera became head service employees New York State. Nearly 60 years times, House voted Friday condemn Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact 1939. The measure, nonbinding resolution, was brought floor Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He is Lithuanian descent, has pocket Lithuanians his hometown Collinsville and wants try highlight his support Baltic states' efforts Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure is example how members Congress are spending their time they stand idle and wait Republican leaders reach agreement spending bills White House, thus avoiding government shutdown and allowing them go home and campaign November elections. With time their hands, many Republicans are using House floor their personal stage elicit votes topics that they can boast folks back home. Most these matters have little chance finding their way law, members hope turn them their advantage Election Day. There are plenty other items whose sponsors hope will not attract attention. These tend be special-interest matters that members hope will escape scrutiny rush leave town. The sponsors these measures now have added advantage impeachment inquiry, which has been preoccupying Congress, news media and public and giving them cover move their pet causes quietly gigantic omnibus package that Congress will eventually present Clinton signing. These quieter measures include one proposed Mississippi's two senators, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, Republicans. They want agriculture export credits buy chickens Russia, which has bought chickens cannot pay them. The chickens are Mississippi. Democrats have little influence Republican-controlled Congress. But some Democrats are close enough Republican leaders, and Republican goals, that their measures are taken seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., ranking Democrat national security subcommittee Appropriations Committee, who is pushing measure increase military pensions. Perhaps best example attempt force vote political advantage is measure that would require minors notify their parents if they are seeking contraceptives federally funded family planning clinics. House leaders allowed measure be brought floor way appease more conservative members, who believe they have been shortchanged budget process. It passed House vote 224-200 has almost no chance becoming law. The Senate does not plan take it up, and Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said that votes these were important because they put their sponsors' ideological foes record opposing something that sounds reasonable, and that opposition can be used them Nov. 3 election. It was not voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, neurologist Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, it said, was calling discuss national leadership award. Dr. Rymer has won acclaim director prominent stroke-treatment center, this proposition seemed particularly grand. When she returned call, she said she was told she would also be named honorary chairman elite committee advise Gingrich legislation. Too good be true? Well, Dr. Rymer would have pay her way if committee should actually meet, and honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would be member committee composed entirely honorary chairmen. And oh, speaker wanted donation $500 $1,000 help our efforts, according transcript similar chat another doctor, elect bigger Republican majority House Representatives. With approach midterm elections next month, it turns out that National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports candidates House, has been sponsoring similar calls tens thousands small-business owners, including doctors. With this and other fund-raising programs, committee says it has amassed $62 million elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say solicitations mark new departure political fund raising, one they call akin practices marketing companies Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumers visions million-dollar windfalls induce them subscribe magazines. By citing speaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, calls are bait-and-switch scheme seize attention people who might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer says she was incensed. So was Dr. Stanley Turecki, child and family psychiatrist New York who votes independent and was also called. I was absolutely outraged, he said. Anybody else who would do that would fall category consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, Washington lawyer who specializes election law and represents Democratic and Republican clients, said, I have never heard that particular device. But it doesn't appear illegal, he said, adding, It's fund-raising gimmick get attention. Fred Wertheimer, president Democracy 21, nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate campaign finance reform, said, This is new version caveat emptor  buyer be damned instead buyer beware. When businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations. But this isn't going be investigated because it's members Congress who are doing it. Todd Harris, spokesman National Republican Congressional Committee, said that he had not heard any complaints and that there was no intent deceive. The national leadership award is part what we call donor and member fulfillment, Harris said. It's part bringing them process. It's important that they be recognized support they give party. There's no quid pro quo that people solicited could receive awards contributions, he added. What most peeves Drs. Rymer and Turecki is message left secretaries and answering machines invoking Gingrich's office and proposing award. They say they envisioned senior aide telephone speaker's chambers Capitol Dome. The calls, however, are not placed aides Gingrich, any his offices or anyone Washington. They are made people headsets and computers home InfoCision Management Corp., telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client Akron, Ohio. On its Web page, InfoCision says its 1,400 employees operate 1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers. Every word script is approved our clients, company says its Web site. Every conceivable objection is scripted powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing businesses, said Jamie Blair, supervisor center, we specialize helping Republican Party and conservative political groups. However far they are Gingrich, telemarketers are instructed answer return calls with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor Kansas City, Mo., who is registered Republican and who declined be named, dialed Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left answering machines and secretly recorded ensuing discussion, which is legal Missouri. We were asked contact you behalf speaker, says woman who picked call and identified herself Nancy. He is right now aggressively pushing legislation cut taxes much half, and he's also interested legislation cut capital gains single rate 15 percent. To assure passage legislation, speaker wants increase his Republican majority, she says, adding, To help us do that, speaker is pulling together group individuals such yourself and is inviting you be honorary chairman his advisory council. Nancy continues: There will be correspondence speaker, such conference calls. It's great way that he can get your input and thoughts legislation that does concern you. Or maybe surveys or questionnaires. Later, Nancy says: As member his committee, you would be receiving speaker our national leadership award, which is really quite honor. And be honest, he will be asking each our chairmen if they could help our efforts increase our majority one-time contribution $500 or $1,000. Now that would be used nationwide media campaign that Newt has undertaken target those seats we really need. And someone who I'm sure would also benefit this, could I tell speaker he could count your help? The doctor demurs. I am registered, you know, Republican Kansas, she tells Nancy. Probably if I were do something it would be go my representative. Then doctor tries ascertain where Nancy is located. Is this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talking to? doctor asks. The speaker's office, says Nancy. This is speaker's office. That I'm talking to, says doctor, double-checking. Uh-huh, Nancy replies. The law prohibits political fund-raising calls federal offices. Vice President Al Gore is Justice Department investigation fund-raising calls he allegedly made his office 1996 presidential campaign. But calls can be made just anywhere else, including campaign offices. Harris said calls are no way related speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What is more important is not where calls get routed. People are more interested award speaker's good name it whether call gets routed Washington or Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see it basic sleaze, he said. The last time George Voinovich ran office, he won re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning his most optimistic supporters and setting 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican who is barred seeking third term, is running again, this time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat who is retiring. And while there are few who expect Voinovich repeat his electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge that he is well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That has not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state what she describes grass-roots campaign that, while operating comparative shoestring, has nonetheless attracted her side nationally known Democrats  President Clinton foremost them  campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut who is preparing return space this month age 77, has not made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward who allowed state's schools decline. He promised be education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven and half years he has failed students this state. Her role campaign, she said, is remind people state Ohio that George Voinovich made promise and that he didn't deliver it. Specifically, she discusses decision last year Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparities quality state's schools and ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She has also attacked her Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under that plan, half additional funds would have been used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved be wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters opposing it. While topics taxes and education are hot ones this political season Ohio, it is not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis them has helped her campaign. Despite some narrowing opinion polls, she is still trailing Voinovich 15 percentage points some polls and much 20 points others. There is also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who is running her first statewide race and has widespread union support, has raised nearly $2 million so far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich has taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, has been statewide ballots five times last 20 years and thus is better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio are also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, its history industrial, unionized cities, has tradition voting largely Democratic candidates, while southern tier state is considered more conservative and typically leans Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share same home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage that accompanies Democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, has developed reputation moderate Republican who works well Democrats. Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping full schedule official duties, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I will probably know more domestic policy any member Senate, he said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony and fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I had my nose rubbed problems urban America and was fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I have dealt problems Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm only person United States who has been president National League Cities and chairman National Governors Association. To his opponent's charges his record education, Voinovich is dismissive. I'm probably only Republican United States who has been endorsed Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle was vice chairman Ways and Means Committee and member Democratic leadership those years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, they nothing technology and urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, who has not begun run campaign commercials television, said her status underdog had allowed me be more focused, more intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey here Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This has been marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. In cocoon loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said Friday that he must live consequences his mistakes, although he contended that Democrats should take pride achievements his presidency and take heart its possibilities. Clinton has stopped apologizing his conduct Monica Lewinsky, he has taken making glancing, times humble, references it, moving attack Republican Congress indifferent Americans' needs. He so Friday series fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit country's economic strength, making compact appeal sympathy and support appearance earlier day Cleveland. After thanking gathered donors very kind personal things they had said him, president declared, If I had do it all again, every day, I would do it heartbeat, see America where it is today compared six years ago. As applause died away, Clinton continued, I want you understand, too, that we all have live consequences our mistakes life. He added chuckle: Most us don't have live it quite such public way. But nobody gets out life free. To music saxophone and hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised $200,000 lunch private home Cleveland Democratic Senate candidate Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then he flew Philadelphia raise half million dollars Democratic Party. By midsummer, president's aides were delighted have persuaded him condense his fund-raising remarks just 10 minutes policy points and partisan jabbing. But his troubles have grown and mid-term elections have approached, his free-form remarks have become longer. In Cleveland Friday, he spoke 26 minutes and here Friday evening he spoke almost 20 minutes. These fund-raising visits have fallen pattern Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony Aug. 17. He is lauded, applauded and embraced his hosts and donors. Mr. President, these are your friends here today, said Tony George, host Cleveland event, offering refrain those who have played similar role. But Cleveland elsewhere, protesters who were scattered president's motorcade route were reminders calls his resignation and impeachment, and mockery some are heaping his presidency. At rally president city hall here Friday night group Teamsters chanted, two more years. Clinton's motorcade route was lined downtown hundreds people, some them carrying supportive or condemnatory signs. After impromptu shopping trip, which he was greeted shouts We love you, Clinton told some donors beginning impassioned reprise his Cleveland speech: I didn't mind protesters, that's American way. But, he added, he preferred it when they were minority, and that seemed be case. As he rode Cleveland, Clinton passed billboard local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', it read, words superimposed cartoon president his arm Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, Washington Monument them. The president left it his aides Friday respond directly latest gusher grand jury disclosures Washington. Instead, his remarks, Clinton spoke pride his record and urgency addressing international economic crisis and needs struggling farmers and schoolchildren. As he typically does now such partisan audiences, he also walked his political calculation mid-term elections. Clinton said Cleveland that Republicans had bragged privately him their prospects. They tell me, `Oh, we're going do very well, Mr. President, these mid-terms because we have so much more money you do,' and because Democrats who turned out re-elect Clinton would not return polls off-year. That argument, course, would also insulate Clinton any blame depressing Democratic vote. But he goes further that, saying that his predicament could actually help Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not bother vote typical election. The people that were good enough serve you here this event today, they've got lot hassles their life, he said. But, he said, adversity is our friend, because it can overcome apathy and focus us what is issue here. What should be issue, Clinton said, are his achievements and agenda and Republicans' record, which he described harshly. What have they done? he asked Cleveland. They killed minimum wage increase 12 million Americans. They killed campaign finance reform. They killed tobacco reform legislation. White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato re-election, are intensely lobbying group try shift its support Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, officials organization, Human Rights Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position closely watched race, considered tightest nation. They said they would probably make endorsement Friday. But privately, organization officials and gay activists parties who have been monitoring debate say group is most likely endorse D'Amato, Republican seeking his fourth term. They also raised possibility that group would endorse candidates, or remain neutral. If group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke condition anonymity, endorsement would be based three major factors: The group tends favor incumbents, has been searching allies Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record gay issues be quite strong. An endorsement group, which is held high regard many gay and lesbian voters, could prove important swinging voters D'Amato tight race. It would also be major symbolic victory senator, who has sought recast himself centrist recent years and could use endorsement build his standing moderate swing voters. A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts portray incumbent right-wing extremist and would signify many voters fraying traditional Democratic coalition that has included black and gay voters, women and labor unions. The intensity debate surrounding endorsement underscores importance New York Senate race Democrats nation, who see defeating D'Amato one their best opportunities prevent Republicans gaining 60 seats Senate  enough stop Democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold 55-to-45 majority. There is sentiment community that if Republicans get 60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be charge politically next two years, said David Mixner, close friend President Clinton's who is gay. He was referring Senate majority leader, who has called homosexuality sin and likened it kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer picked his endorsement New York's largest gay and lesbian political organization, Empire State Pride Agenda. Although Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been very close Clinton administration, has many Democrats its board and receives much its money Democratic contributors. Largely because group's strong Democratic ties, gay Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials are infuriated that it is endorsing D'Amato, who also runs Right Life and Conservative Party lines and receives high ratings Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation civil rights gay people. Although organization has been thought be inching D'Amato endorsement months, lobbying campaign Schumer has picked intensity last two weeks, driven partly growing sense that race is now closer ever. Democrats and advocates parties who support rights gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made personal appeals Human Rights Campaign officials urging them not endorse D'Amato. White House officials said they not know whether three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials declined comment. Schumer met privately group's top officials last week make one last pitch endorsement. Clinton administration officials have also been buttonholing group's board members every opportunity, cocktail parties fund-raisers, raising concerns D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocates civil rights gay people have flooded organization phone calls, e-mail messages and letters. Democratic officials have been encouraging group's major donors express their opposition D'Amato. People involved lobbying efforts said that best, they are hoping group will endorse candidates, or make no endorsement all. Chuck Schumer has been strong supporter issues that are important gay communities, said senior White House official who spoke condition anonymity. The last thing that they should want do is hurt candidacy someone who has been so supportive their agenda. The Human Rights Campaign is considered most influential gay and lesbian organization Washington, national membership 250,000 and annual budget more $13 million. The group was created early 1980s large part counter rise Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato was first elected Reagan landslide 1980 and remained strong supporter President Reagan. For D'Amato, who has aggressively courted gay voters, endorsement would represent crowning achievement his efforts reposition himself moderate. Since 1993, senator has backed right gay citizens serve military, sponsored legislation prevent job discrimination gay workers and opposed his leadership's attempts block nominations two openly gay men positions Clinton administration. To gay supporters D'Amato, endorsement Human Rights Campaign would signify political maturation gay electorate and help organization insulate itself accusations that it is too close Democratic Party. Those who support D'Amato endorsement, including top officials Human Rights Campaign, contend that current political climate, where Congress is almost certain remain Republican control November, gay people must build alliances moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy is support friendly incumbents, when their challengers have better voting records gay issues. That is case New York, where Schumer's rating Human Rights Campaign has been consistently better D'Amato's. Both men, however, have angered advocates rights gay people voting legislation that allows states not recognize gay marriages. In precedent widely cited D'Amato supporters, organization endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, Democrat, Republican challenger, William Weld, 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, though Weld's record gay rights was considered stronger. The move angered gay Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that group is biased Democrats. But there is clearly large number Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage group, particularly women. They fear that abortion rights supporters will quit group droves because D'Amato has never wavered his opposition abortion 18 years Congress. Many New York gay activists would also be deeply upset if group endorses D'Amato, whom they blame installing state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive director Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role architect state Republican Party major reason group endorsed Schumer. While he has criticized fellow Republicans Washington their intolerance, here home, his party's blatant discrimination is still order day, Foreman said. For that reason, some White House officials say they think Human Rights Campaign endorsement D'Amato will be almost meaningless gay voters. They contend that it might hurt senator his conservative base. I don't think anybody will vote Al D'Amato because HRC endorsement, said White House aide who spoke condition anonymity. But I think some people Right Life Party and some upstate people are going say, `Who is this guy and why should we vote him?' White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato re-election, are intensely lobbying group try shift its support Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, officials organization, Human Rights Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position closely watched race, considered tightest nation. They said they would probably make endorsement Friday. But privately, organization officials and gay activists parties who have been monitoring debate say group is most likely endorse D'Amato, Republican seeking his fourth term. They also raised possibility that group would endorse candidates, or remain neutral. If group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke condition anonymity, endorsement would be based three major factors: The group tends favor incumbents, has been searching allies Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record gay issues be quite strong. An endorsement group, which is held high regard many gay and lesbian voters, could prove important swinging voters D'Amato tight race. It would also be major symbolic victory senator, who has sought recast himself centrist recent years and could use endorsement build his standing moderate swing voters. A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts portray incumbent right-wing extremist and would signify many voters fraying traditional Democratic coalition that has included black and gay voters, women and labor unions. The intensity debate surrounding endorsement underscores importance New York Senate race Democrats nation, who see defeating D'Amato one their best opportunities prevent Republicans gaining 60 seats Senate  enough stop Democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold 55-to-45 majority. There is sentiment community that if Republicans get 60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be charge politically next two years, said David Mixner, close friend President Clinton's who is gay. He was referring Senate majority leader, who has called homosexuality sin and likened it kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer picked his endorsement New York's largest gay and lesbian political organization, Empire State Pride Agenda. Although Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been very close Clinton administration, has many Democrats its board and receives much its money Democratic contributors. Largely because group's strong Democratic ties, gay Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials are infuriated that it is endorsing D'Amato, who also runs Right Life and Conservative Party lines and receives high ratings Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation civil rights gay people. Although organization has been thought be inching D'Amato endorsement months, lobbying campaign Schumer has picked intensity last two weeks, driven partly growing sense that race is now closer ever. Democrats and advocates parties who support rights gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made personal appeals Human Rights Campaign officials urging them not endorse D'Amato. White House officials said they not know whether three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials declined comment. Schumer met privately group's top officials last week make one last pitch endorsement. Clinton administration officials have also been buttonholing group's board members every opportunity, cocktail parties fund-raisers, raising concerns D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocates civil rights gay people have flooded organization phone calls, e-mail messages and letters. Democratic officials have been encouraging group's major donors express their opposition D'Amato. People involved lobbying efforts said that best, they are hoping group will endorse candidates, or make no endorsement all. Chuck Schumer has been strong supporter issues that are important gay communities, said senior White House official who spoke condition anonymity. The last thing that they should want do is hurt candidacy someone who has been so supportive their agenda. The Human Rights Campaign is considered most influential gay and lesbian organization Washington, national membership 250,000 and annual budget more $13 million. The group was created early 1980s large part counter rise Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato was first elected Reagan landslide 1980 and remained strong supporter President Reagan. For D'Amato, who has aggressively courted gay voters, endorsement would represent crowning achievement his efforts reposition himself moderate. Since 1993, senator has backed right gay citizens serve military, sponsored legislation prevent job discrimination gay workers and opposed his leadership's attempts block nominations two openly gay men positions Clinton administration. To gay supporters D'Amato, endorsement Human Rights Campaign would signify political maturation gay electorate and help organization insulate itself accusations that it is too close Democratic Party. Those who support D'Amato endorsement, including top officials Human Rights Campaign, contend that current political climate, where Congress is almost certain remain Republican control November, gay people must build alliances moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy is support friendly incumbents, when their challengers have better voting records gay issues. That is case New York, where Schumer's rating Human Rights Campaign has been consistently better D'Amato's. Both men, however, have angered advocates rights gay people voting legislation that allows states not recognize gay marriages. In precedent widely cited D'Amato supporters, organization endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, Democrat, Republican challenger, William Weld, 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, though Weld's record gay rights was considered stronger. The move angered gay Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that group is biased Democrats. But there is clearly large number Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage group, particularly women. They fear that abortion rights supporters will quit group droves because D'Amato has never wavered his opposition abortion 18 years Congress. Many New York gay activists would also be deeply upset if group endorses D'Amato, whom they blame installing state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive director Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role architect state Republican Party major reason group endorsed Schumer. While he has criticized fellow Republicans Washington their intolerance, here home, his party's blatant discrimination is still order day, Foreman said. For that reason, some White House officials say they think Human Rights Campaign endorsement D'Amato will be almost meaningless gay voters. They contend that it might hurt senator his conservative base. I don't think anybody will vote Al D'Amato because HRC endorsement, said White House aide who spoke condition anonymity. But I think some people Right Life Party and some upstate people are going say, `Who is this guy and why should we vote him?' In other election years, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would have had little common other that they were Democrats relatively safe seats. Price is centrist who has represented this high-tech district North Carolina all 2 last 12 years, political scientist who has taught Duke and Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, is House freshman who worked her way politics grass roots, having been reared poverty. But party officials who opened this election year high hopes recapturing House are beginning worry that Democratic incumbents Price and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril Election Day. As many congressional races, biggest variable is White House scandal, which has injected fear and uncertainty campaigns country. Other Democratic incumbents who Republican officials cite locked contests that are more competitive expected include Reps. Corrine Brown Florida, Vic Snyder Arkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher California, Martin Frost Texas, Melvin Watt North Carolina, John LaFalce New York and Sander Levin Michigan. Here North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledging that his polls showed him tight race, said: This is swing district that is sensitive any tide or trend. It's something you think lot connection president's troubles. The efforts Price and Mrs. Carson contain Lewinsky debacle  and their opponents' attempts capitalize it  offer important clues suggesting how Clinton's problems are influencing conduct races country. Many Democrats are straddling line that seems shift bit every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want appear close president whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing possibility public backlash Republicans, they are weighing their words carefully and are wary hopping any impeachment bandwagon. And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that scandal will have little impact them, their campaigns are preparing worst placing greater emphasis ever behind-the-efforts prod their core constituencies vote. In reflection uncertainty that Clinton scandal has cast Republicans, challengers Price and Carson districts  are political novices seeking office first time  have differing strategies: Tom Roberg, computer executive Raleigh who is taking Price, has broadcast television commercial exploiting scandal. Tom Roberg has called Bill Clinton's resignation, narrator says. This is not time be silent, Price. Where do you stand? But Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking more subtle approach: rather mention scandal directly, he notes he can that Julia votes Clinton almost 100 percent time. Asked why he was not much raising scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody when they're process committing suicide. There would be danger if we went overboard. The best evidence discomfort Price and Mrs. Carson is that when asked separate interviews whether they would want Clinton campaign their districts, said it would be impossible this late date White House schedule visit. What if there was sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed bit and mustered answers that were hardly affirmative. Given president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I don't think that would be such good idea, he said. I've never had president campaign here, and I wouldn't want start this time although he is eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff and popular native son North Carolina, stump him here this Sunday.) Making strategy stump is further complicated anecdotal evidence that runs counter Democratic fears and Republican hopes. In three days campaign stops here North Carolina and Indianapolis, scandal was rarely raised any voter being courted candidates either party. When reporter asked it, many voters said that appalled they were Clinton's behavior, they had hard time relating it their decision which way vote congressional elections five weeks. As Hofmeister walked parking lot gun and knife show Indiana National Guard Armory Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, 57-year-old machinist who is retired disability, called him express outrage millions dollars that had been spent investigate Clinton. It's pathetic spend all our money, said Derringer, who identified himself independent. It shouldn't have gotten this far. Hofmeister tried his best make Republicans' case. There has be rule law, he said. Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing voters alike would become so fed Lewinsky inquiry that issue might help her. To that end, she proudly informs audiences that she voted making public report delivered House Kenneth Starr, Whitewater independent counsel. I was one 63 members Congress who voted putting all that filth Internet, she said, adding that Starr's inquiry had been cruel hoax terms fiscal responsibility and accountability. The Carson campaign is counting voters Timothy Daly, 38-year-old real estate executive who voted Republican two years ago now favors Mrs. Carson. I'm pulling Democratic ticket because I'm tired it: right side Republican Party is playing politics, Daly said. We'd see them go people's business. Back here 4th District, Price has some reasons be worried. He was first elected House 1986 but, four-term incumbent, was ousted Republican sweep 1994 (only win his seat back two years later). In addition, district was redrawn last year include large Durham section where voters do not know him well. Determined not be midterm casualty Clinton once again, Price says he is waging most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign his career. Rather engage Roberg Clinton scandal, Price has begun broadcasting television commercial that emphasizes his central issue: education. The congressman's advisers say they intentionally produced advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical  it features school children play  effort break television clutter scandal. But Price campaign also has weapon it is holding reserve, event Roberg appears be riding Clinton scandal advantage: incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid running commercials underscoring that he earned divinity degree getting his doctorate political science. At coffee voters wealthy enclave Raleigh other night, Roberg opened his remarks asserting that Clinton had lost moral authority lead. Yet none those assembled asked him scandal; they were more concerned state's plans build highway their neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich ran office, he won re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning his most optimistic supporters and setting 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican who is barred seeking third term, is running again, this time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat who is retiring. And while there are few who expect Voinovich repeat his electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge that he is well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That has not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state what she describes grass-roots campaign that, while operating comparative shoestring, has nonetheless attracted her side nationally known Democrats  President Clinton foremost them  campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut who is preparing return space this month age 77, has not made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward who allowed state's schools decline. He promised be education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven and half years he has failed students this state. Her role campaign, she said, is remind people state Ohio that George Voinovich made promise and that he didn't deliver it. Specifically, she discusses decision last year Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparities quality state's schools and ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She has also attacked her Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under that plan, half additional funds would have been used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved be wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters opposing it. While topics taxes and education are hot ones this political season Ohio, it is not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis them has helped her campaign. Despite some narrowing opinion polls, she is still trailing Voinovich 10 percentage points some polls and much 18 points others. There is also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who is running her first statewide race and has widespread union support, has raised nearly $2 million so far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich has taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, has been statewide ballots five times last 20 years and thus is better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio are also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, its history industrial, unionized cities, has tradition voting largely Democratic candidates, while southern tier state is considered more conservative and typically leans Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share same home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage that accompanies Democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, has developed reputation moderate Republican who works well Democrats. Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping full schedule official duties, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I will probably know more domestic policy any member Senate, he said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony and fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I had my nose rubbed problems urban America and was fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I have dealt problems Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm only person United States who has been president National League Cities and chairman National Governors Association. To his opponent's charges his record education, Voinovich is dismissive. I'm probably only Republican United States who has been endorsed Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle was vice chairman Ways and Means Committee and member Democratic leadership those years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, they nothing technology and urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, who has not begun run campaign commercials television, said her status underdog had allowed me be more focused, more intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey here Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This has been marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republican who is running re-election, went Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal other morning accept award mass-transit advocates. But reporters who had gathered there showed little interest shiny train car senator's back. Instead, they repeatedly asked him how he would vote impeachment President Clinton. Look, I'm not going make any comment respect that subject matter, D'Amato responded. I am not just citizen. I am citizen-senator who may be called make decision. But D'Amato is something else well: candidate what may be tightest Senate race nation. And variations his elliptical response can be heard Senate races country, where Republicans and Democrats are encountering similar questions. All which suggests that House voted Thursday authorize impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 races U.S. Senate have become, what they already were, electoral equivalent jury selection. If House votes impeach Clinton, matter goes Senate, which must decide two-thirds majority whether convict him and, thus, remove him office. As result, Monica Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected new disruptive force Senate contests. Voters, those who support Clinton, expect their political leaders, Republican or Democratic, renounce Clinton's behavior, and candidates have been doing that. But impeachment is another matter; most polls show nation is it. The danger Senate candidates is that impeachment now real possibility, debate may move president's behavior  which there is little disagreement  more problematic issue whether he should be removed office. For most strategists involved races, there is little guidance how handle impeachment issue. Advisers candidates parties said interviews last week that they were perplexed and worried, unsure what they can or should do issue gain advantage  or guard harm. I can't tell how this one is going go, said Mike Russell, spokesman Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This is very surreal environment. Of 34 Senate seats play, 18 are held Democrats and 16 Republicans, who now hold 55 seats all. Republicans would have win 28 34 races produce 67 votes necessary conviction, assuming such vote were go party lines. Only electoral catastrophe Democrats, which seems almost unthinkable, could produce such huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate races Cook Political Report, nonpartisan newsletter, said that so far, least, none Senate candidates has made explicit appeal votes based how they would vote presidential jury. But she and are wondering if this may be change. This is difficult ground measure. One central questions this political year has been how Clinton's dealings Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For long time, politicians assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home rebuke Clinton, just many Republicans November 1974, three months President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But now some analysts wonder if partisan fight Congress last week might have effect some Democrats. That's problem, said Stuart Rothenberg, editor independent political newsletter Washington. It's not that we don't know, and that politicians don't know, where general public stands impeachment. The problem is that we don't know where electorate stands impeachment. And asking voters think ahead impeachment proceeding they cast their ballots Senate race is, words Stuart Stevens, Republican consultant, double bank-shot. Such strategies, he said, tend work only small number single-minded or sophisticated voters. Against that complicated backdrop, prevailing thinking is that use impeachment issue will vary race race, state state and week week, depending circumstances candidates and composition electorate. If Democrats try turn image Clinton dock their advantage, it would be states Democratic edge or sizable numbers black voters, who overwhelmingly support president. In contests those, it might well prove be interest Democratic candidate to, one consultant put it, sit front camera and tape advertisement which candidate denounces president's behavior solemnly pledges vote impeachment. Strategists parties believe that kind approach could prove effective. This is issue where there is huge disconnect elites and public, said Fred Yang, Democratic consultant clients Wisconsin and Carolinas. That kind Democratic strategy might emerge California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats South Carolina, Georgia and Nevada would be less likely oppose Clinton's impeachment. On other side, Republican consultants are telling their candidates stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away talk impeachment. The last thing party wants is turn Senate elections referendum whether Clinton should be forced office. The White House might think overall public numbers that maybe they would make this referendum election, said Ed Goeas, Republican pollster who is working Senate races this year. Republicans certainly aren't going let that happen. D'Amato responded questions Clinton language that Republican consultants have been suggesting their candidates. When and if that matter comes Senate, I will decide facts that are presented me that time, D'Amato said. It would be very premature me suggest any course action it being referred. Because, indeed, we may be called act jury some kind. But Schumer, member House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting impeachment investigation, virtually embraced issue. In live telecast hearings, he said president deserved lesser punishment, such censure or reprimand. And Schumer plans campaign New York Monday Clinton his side. Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seemed suggest last week that impeachment will grow issue. Senator D'Amato claims he does not want share his opinion people New York, Morris said. And if he doesn't have opinion, he's only New Yorker who doesn't have opinion. Asked if Schumer would raise issue television commercial, Morris responded: We don't talk what we're going do. I wouldn't rule it and I wouldn't rule it out.

Yugoslavia must cooperate U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating alleged atrocities wars Croatia and Bosnia, international legal experts meeting Belgrade said Sunday. The meeting was first international debate Yugoslavia U.N. tribunal's work and government's cooperation it. The tribunal, established U.N. Security Council 1993, sits The Hague, Netherlands. Despite objections tribunal, Yugoslav authorities allowed two-day discussions  organized Belgrade-based, non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center  take place any problems. State-run media largely ignored event. Though there were some disagreements, participants discussions generally agreed that crimes humanity cannot go unpunished. The indicted who are not The Hague are at-large because refusal Croatian and Yugoslav authorities arrest and extradite them, said Mark Ellis, lawyer and representative American Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting Serbia and Montenegro, cooperates tribunal cases where Serbs were victims Bosnia and Croatia, two former republics that fought wars their secession. But Yugoslavia has questioned tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses indict three army officers wanted alleged war crimes Croatia. Last week, it also refused allow U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities Serbia's southern Kosovo province where ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting government forces. The tribunal was founded satanize Serbs, said Miodrag Mitic, former legal adviser Yugoslavia's foreign ministry. He said U.N. court was influenced powerful countries that dominate international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, U.S. State Department's ambassador at-large war crimes, demanded Yugoslavia's full cooperation. Some closest combat half year Kosovo conflict, point fighting room room and floor floor, occurred this village six weeks ago, days 21 women, children and elderly members Delijaj clan were massacred Serbian forces, their mutilated bodies left strewn forest floor. Piecing together what happened, surviving family members, ethnic Albanian separatist forces and official Serbian information, story emerges fierce guerrilla resistance onslaught Serbian tanks, artillery and infantry. The Serbian forces fighting here appear have suffered unusually heavy losses and, guerrillas finally fled, took revenge civilians, shooting women and children close range they tried run away their pursuers. According relatives who found bodies, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, was decapitated, his brain left display ground. Hava Delijaj, 65, was shot and one her feet cut knife so that it hung thread skin. Young women and children who had run few hundred yards rocky path were mowed down. Miraculously, 6-week-old baby, Diturie, was found her father alive clasp her dead mother, Lumnije, 30, more 24 hours killings. Blood was her mouth and her mother's hand baby, said Imer Delijaj, father, avowed member Kosovo Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, who returned uniform discover bodies. I moved her hand and that moment she opened her eyes. I realized she was alive. I tried clean blood her mouth and she put her tongue out. Several members Delijaj clan survived. Zejnije Delijaj, 39, who had cooked guerrillas family compound when they returned fighting days massacre, recalled how she fled, crawling, falling, running and hiding woods Serbs shot her. I could feel dirt hitting me impact bullets, she said interview, her nose still bloodied what she said was heavy fall her flight. First it was machine guns, then grenades, then cannon, she said. Every time I moved and they heard leaves rustling, they shot. The massacre Delijajs, whose forebears settled Drenica Valley 150 years ago, was not first conflict that ravaged Serbian province March and October and has now lulled uneasy truce. Indeed, conflict Serbian forces bent keeping Kosovo Serbia and guerrillas fighting independence its heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew international attention massacre Jasari clan early March Serbian units Prekaz, central Kosovo. But killing Delijajs, ranging paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94, who was burned his bed, slaughter Valmir, 18 months, who was found shot, is most thoroughly documented so far. Human Rights Watch, New York-based group, believes knowledge gathered so far increases possibility prosecutions U.N. war crimes tribunal The Hague, Netherlands. The Hague's prosecutors could also draw observations diplomats, human rights monitors and reporters who saw bodies scattered ravine where victims were killed they were buried shallow graves clan's nearby compound. In other Kosovo massacres, bodies had been moved sites they were seen independent observers. Further, family members who survived assault have described what they saw and circumstances hills and valleys Obrinje Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, their headquarters Likovac, north here. By then, Albanian guerrillas had fled area Delijaj compound, dispersing what senior commander Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim Maloku, termed particularly fierce combat Serbs. In days Sept. 26, he said, guerrillas  caught Serbian pincer movement  had decided fight rather surrender. The fighting  sometimes house house, room room  took unusually heavy toll Serbs, said Maloku, former officer Yugoslav army. He said he believed that it was those deaths Serbs avenged massacre Delijajs. In other major attacks conflict, guerrillas generally found escape hatch. In Obrinje, led another former officer Yugoslav army whom Maloku declined name, guerrillas fought, using land mines and rocket-propelled grenades. Maloku said he knew report made rebel headquarters that least 47 Serbian soldiers and police officers were killed fighting here and Bajince, three miles east. We took weapons 47 Serbs, he said. The state-controlled Serbian media center Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officers were killed fighting, including five reservists who died when their vehicle hit antitank mine Sept. 25. The announcement 10 Serbs killed one action is unusually high. The practice taking violent revenge is time-honored tradition Balkans. From 1991 1995, wars Croatia and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, far lesser extent, main victims, Muslims, avenged World War II massacres and new blood feuds, driven killing leaders who exploited old conflicts carve new fiefs themselves old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed. In this case, it appears, Serbian vengeance was visited Delijajs. Survivors clan said they had feared assault their collection mud and brick homes lining rocky dirt track directly village Likovac, Serbs' base just mile away. The Serbs had pushed rebels out Likovac August and guerrillas had established new headquarters Bajince, six miles east Obrinje. As Serbs swept nearby Cicavica Mountains, and road that runs Pristina Klina, it was clear that Obrinje would be target. Most women and children area had moved Apple Valley, where more 10,000 refugees had gathered outdoors, seeking safety numbers. But Imer Delijaj, 38, said he decided that ravine his family compound would be better hiding place. He said he believed women, children and elderly would be spared if Serbs found them. As Serbs approached foot Saturday morning massacre, last person flee compound itself was Bashkim Delijaj, 21, youngest son 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj said he had stayed look his bedridden father. The shelling started again 7 a.m. Saturday and I saw tank convoy approaching, infantry tanks, Bashkim Delijaj recalled interview. I was smoking cigarette when grenade fell roof and hole gate I saw soldiers coming 30 meters away. They were brown army uniforms, had huge knives or small axes. Many had beards. Bashkim Delijaj said he was unable carry his father safety, and not have courage tell him what was happening. I told him I was getting animals out barn, he said. He said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventually received shelter farmer, all time hearing shooting and shelling. When firing had died Monday morning, he returned compound and ran Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform. They went one houses and found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 33, shot dead, his body sprawled ground rain, and burned torso Fazli. I looked window our house and saw only bones my father, which looked what we learned biology class, he said. Together, two men went find out what had happened ravine. There they found bodies. First, Ali, 65, who, Imer Delijaj said, had been cut neck his tobacco cutting knife. Then Pajazit, who had been decapitated makeshift tent, his brain placed two foam mattresses. Then Hava, 65, who was sprawled tent. They moved find Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who was seven months pregnant, had been mutilated, he said. A little further ravine, Imer said he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30. He opened his wife's coat and found his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 months old and recovering relative's home Likovac. He said he tried clean baby and then put her his jacket and walked few feet further find bodies his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young children, Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7. The corpses other family members were found woods and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, were found next morning, Imer said. On Oct. 3, bodies two missing teen-age girls, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, were found bushes side road abandoned Serbian police compound. Later month, body Hajriz was found pushed well, close ravine. One uncle, Sharif, who was ravine, is still missing, presumed dead. Human Rights Watch, which has been documenting Delijaj massacre, has described it most vicious pattern attacks civilians Serbs Kosovo conflict. (To lesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians, forcing them their homes, and allegedly carried out least two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicates that Gornje Obrinje killings were followed conscious mutilations carried out victims were killed, coming report Human Rights Watch says. Delijaj family members have told Human Rights Watch monitors and that they saw ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying Serbian police officers fighting. They believe that police officer, who is posted nearby Glogovac police station, was used Serbian special police officers guide Obrinje area. This police officer, who is apparently one small group ethnic Albanians officers who have remained loyal Serbs, could be important witness criminal investigators war-crimes tribunal The Hague, according human rights experts. The ethnic Albanian policeman could be important witness identifying police and army units responsible atrocities, said Peter Boueckhart, researcher Human Rights Watch. It is vital that those who carried out these atrocities are prosecuted Hague tribunal. At burned Delijaj compound last week, Imer Delijaj has been acting host wake which, Albanian tradition, will last several weeks and began family members returned their hiding places woods. Color photographs youngest members family, and Imer's mother and grandmother, have been mounted glass table gate. A 30-year-old faded black and white picture Fazli double-breasted suit stands apart, sign ultimate respect. An outsized Albanian flag black double-headed eagle red field is draped table. Imer Delijaj's face seemed tense and his words were spare he described his family's death. He not express direct remorse allowing his family use hiding place so close family compound, which all practical purposes was informal base fighters. His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, who said he was eager be helpful investigators Hague tribunal, said Pristina that he believed Imer Delijaj felt guilty faulty decision. Whether tribunal will closely examine case remains unclear. Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslav president, has issued only handful visas investigators tribunal. Two investigators who were Kosovo time massacre left six days later visiting site or contacting Krasniqi killings. Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As he sat floor his living room group male visitors, he replied: It's easy answer. If I can see eye eye men I will fight them. But only men uniform and fair fight. If I see children them, I will treat them children all world. Children are children. American and allied forces Bosnia Wednesday arrested Bosnian Serb general who was charged genocide international war crimes tribunal recent secret indictment. Maj. Gen. Radislav Krstic, arrested incident American sector northeast Bosnia, is highest-ranking official be seized so far, and first serving military officer. He is accused directing attack Srebrenica 1995, one most chilling and influential events Bosnian war, when some 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men were marched off, presumably their deaths, U.N. peacekeepers stood by. The indictment Krstic accuses him having committed genocide and fall Srebrenica July 11 and Nov. 1, 1995. He is indicted connection direct personal involvement commission these crimes well his command responsibility. He is also accused murder and other crimes humanity. Krstic was colonel 1995, and deputy commander Drina battalion, was promoted general days fall Srebrenica. He is considered close associate Bosnian Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, whom are wanted tribunal. And he is considered capable, if he is willing testify, implicating Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who has not been indicted. Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor International Criminal Tribunal former Yugoslavia, called Krstic very significant military leader and said she was delighted arrest. The general was only indicted Oct. 30, tribunal officials said, indictment was kept secret so there would be better chance successful arrest. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana warned that other war crimes suspects still large should realize that they, too, will be brought justice. James Rubin, State Department spokesman, said that arrest serves standing warning those indicted war crimes, who remain large, that they will be held individually accountable their actions. The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily arrest, hardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, saying that his government would now reduce contacts NATO-led peacekeeping forces necessary minimum. Poplasen, who defeated more moderate candidate backed Washington September elections, said arrest Krstic had embittered and upset Bosnian Serbs and would harm implementation Dayton agreement that ended 1992-1995 Bosnian war. He said he would protest arrest, and his remarks were later endorsed parliament majority vote. A senior official NATO country called arrest very good news and said it was warning Milosevic himself and who have not been publicly indicted that murders committed have not been forgotten. A Pentagon official said arrest, most important made American sector, was sign that this is continuing process. NATO-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine people wanted war crimes former Yugoslavia, four whom were subject sealed indictments. There have been numerous calls arrest Mladic and Karadzic, two most infamous men indicted, they normally are accompanied armed guards. NATO forces have never tried arrest them, apparently fearing casualties and angry public reaction Bosnian Serbs. Officials say that Mladic and Karadzic are believed have left Bosnian Serb Republic live Serbia, which is part Yugoslavia and controlled Milosvevic. Krstic, who was transferred The Hague trial, is 35th suspect who has been taken there and 26th person currently being held there. He is commander Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and was arrested while traveling road Bijelina. At outset war 1992, he was officer Yugoslav Army, and all senior Bosnian Serb officers, was transferred new Bosnian Serb force. In 1994, he lost leg mine explosion. One Bosnian Serb official said telephone interview that, time, Krstic had responsibility anti-terrorist units who were given some most difficult tasks. Srebrenica is dark part our history and people don't talk it, official said. But everyone believes it was anti-terrorist units that were sent do killing. In Banja Luka Wednesday, some members Bosnian Serb parliament protested arrest, saying that Krstic was simply doing his job soldier. Ivo Daalder, former Bosnia expert National Security Council, now Brookings Institution, said arrest showed new and promising coordination Tribunal and NATO troops, given rapid arrest Oct. 30 indictment. He also said that arrest serving officer important war crime would send important message. Srebrenica was key town Bosnian conflict. It was where United Nations first made stand March 1993, when commander U.N. troops personally led convoy trucks surrounded town and promised Bosnian Muslims there that Srebrenica would be safe area and United Nations would protect them. But July 1995, United Nations not protect Srebrenica air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watched Serbs marched in, separated Muslim men and women and marched men off. Srebrenica signaled massive failure West, said Daalder. It galvanized United States and NATO act. At London conference later July, NATO agreed defend Gorazde and remaining safe areas massive air strikes if necessary. After mortar attack Sarajevo marketplace late August, NATO air strikes began, signaling last chapter war and leading American-brokered Dayton Accords. In Sarajevo Wednesday, aide Bosnian Muslim member collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, praised arrest. We welcome this action, hoping very soon that time will come Karadzic and Mladic be brought justice, said aide, Mirza Jajric. The arrest took place foreign ministers member countries Organization Security and Cooperation Europe met Oslo, Norway, discuss international effort keep peace Kosovo, southern Serbian province. Under deal pressed Milosevic October, organization will provide 2,000 civilians monitor cease-fire Kosovo and promote political settlement there give Kosovo enhanced autonomy. Macedonia's government Wednesday formally approved basing 1,700 NATO troops its border Kosovo. Those troops will be prepared rush aid civilian monitors if necessary. The president Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized Belgrade authorities anew refusing let U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities Kosovo. In letter United Nations Security Council released Wednesday tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald United States said failure Yugoslav officials grant visas investigators is affront. The intentional and continuous refusal Federal Republic Yugoslavia comply its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations tribunal is affront Security Council and all law-abiding nations, she said. The Texas judge fired letter last Friday refusal Belgrade authorities allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour Canada and team investigators visit Kosovo. McDonald asked Security Council impose measures which are sufficiently compelling bring Federal Republic Yugoslavia fold law-abiding nations. Hundreds people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and many 300,000 driven their homes February, when Serb forces began crackdown ethnic Albanian separatists Kosovo. The tribunal wants look allegations war crimes sides conflict. In its first case deal atrocities Serbs Bosnia's civil war, U.N. war crimes tribunal Monday convicted three prison officials and guards, acquitted top military commander who oversaw facility. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Cmndr. Zejnil Delalic, Bosnian Muslim Army, responsibility war crimes committed government-run prison camp his overall command. Prosecutor Grant Niemann Australia said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal. Judges freed Delalic pending outcome appeal. Let me thank you just and fair judgment, Delalic told court. The judgment has increased my trust this institution. The tribunal convicted camp warden Zdravko Mucic, Croat, 11 war crimes and grave breaches Geneva Conventions because he oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic, wearing dark sunglasses and cross, smiled he heard his sentence seven years prison. Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt Australia said he was appealing Mucic's inadequate sentence. Mucic's conviction was first international court basis command responsibility post-World War II tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors crimes their subordinates. Mr. Mucic was clearly derelict his duty and allowed those his authority commit most heinous offenses, taking any disciplinary action, said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte Nigeria. Monday's verdicts ended marathon 20-month trial that focused brutal mistreatment Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed vast majority war crimes committed 3 1/2-year Bosnian conflict. During trial  tribunal's longest date involving 122 witnesses  survivors described campaign terror unleashed Serbs area. Inmates Celebici prison camp were beaten death guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts, according testimony. Others were set fire, raped and forced commit sexual acts members their family. The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities Celebici asserts that least 14 prisoners were killed 1992. One prisoner was beaten death and had Muslim party badge nailed his head, witness claimed. Yet few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic, humanitarian gestures, such getting food and clothing some prisoners and releasing others. Hazim Delic, Muslim who served deputy warden camp, was found guilty two murders and raping two women well torturing other inmates. He was sentenced 20 years Karibi-Whyte, who denounced rape despicable act which strikes very core human dignity and physical integrity. Delic's defense attorney said he would likely appeal. Esad Landzo, Muslim guard, was convicted killing three prisoners and torturing least three and was sentenced 15 years. His attorneys also are likely appeal conviction. All four defendants had faced life imprisonment, maximum punishment tribunal, which has no death penalty. A charge Delic and Mucic plundering property was dismissed three-judge panel. Mucic also was cleared responsibility four murders and three cases mistreatment or torture prisoners. Delic was cleared two murders, and command responsibility other killings Celebici. He was also acquitted three cases torture. Landzo was cleared one murder charge and one torture count. The tribunal, set Security Council 1993, has convicted only one other person trial  Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced May 1997 20 years killing and torturing Muslims 1992. Two other men have confessed killing Muslims, handing tribunal two more convictions conduction trials. To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was face genocide who once bragged that he had kill 20 or 30 Muslims his morning coffee. Opening genocide trial Monday Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said 30-year-old mechanic used nickname Adolf perverse pride genocidal symbolism it represented. Jelisic pleaded guilty October murdering 12 Muslims and Croats and Serb-run Luka camp set Brcko, northern Bosnia, May 1992. By trying him genocide, prosecutors will be able call evidence background Jelisic's murders, including involvement more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors his killing spree chance tell their story court. Bowers told three-judge tribunal panel that Jelisic admitted interviews investigators far more killings dozen which he has pleaded guilty. Jelisic will be convicted those murders and sentenced end his trial, which is expected last well 1999. He faces maximum sentence life imprisonment. We will never be able fix exact number victims, Bowers said. But if we are believe small percentage totals which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victims certainly number well 100. As trial began, judges were read excerpts psychological report which stated that Jelisic was mentally fit stand trial suffered borderline personality disorder. Wearing striped sweater and black jeans, Jelisic brought laptop computer court and took notes. When he wasn't writing, Jelisic sat slightly slumped his chair, his head still, looking impassively courtroom. Jelisic's campaign murder stands out  tribunal set deal exclusively atrocities  its cold-bloodedness. Once Goran Jelisic declined assistance guard, noting that he was still `good form' though he had killed 60 people, Bowers told judges, citing statements made witnesses due testify later trial. To victims Brcko, face genocide was face Goran Jelisic, he said. Bowers told judges that Jelisic, who held no official rank, was released Bosnian Serb authorities jail, where he was serving three years fraud, and sent Brcko murder Muslims. He told investigators that his arrival town, which was strategic importance Bosnian Serbs, he was given list Muslim targets and ordered kill many possible. Jelisic, Bowers said, seemed relish task. Witness testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic was not reluctant tool genocide who was being compelled Serb authorities act his will, U.S. prosecutor said. Quite contrary, testimony will firmly establish that Goran Jelisic was efficient and enthusiastic participant genocide. Set 1993, U.N. court has convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serb war crimes including murder, rape and torture, it has register genocide conviction.

53,"The radical Islamic group Hamas Monday denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit Gaza Strip carefully avoided making any threats him. Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs On street newly littered debris battle  stones, spent tear gas canisters, charred remnants half-burned tires  sodden Palestinian flag flaps fitful rain-laden wind house mourning. Inside, tinny recorded wail Koranic verses, neighbors and relatives dead man  21-year-old university student felled roof his home Israeli soldier's rubber-coated bullet  sipped tiny cups coffee left unsweetened symbolize bitter occasion. Some smoked, few spoke quietly themselves, most simply sat reflective silence. Among those attendance this day, first traditional three days family mourning, was Saeb Erekat, chief peace negotiator Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, was cousin his. Erekat stayed time, sitting clan elders Arab headdresses and teen-age nephews American-style athletic shoes, then slipped away meeting connection President Clinton's visit beginning this weekend. It's been very difficult, he said later, asked carrying his negotiating duties such time. I have great sense sorrow and sadness, feeling such loss. I hope God will enable me use my grief strengthen my determination peace. The scene Erekat home, Arab village Abu Dis Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drives home central truth Israeli-Palestinian conflict: sides divide, political is also deeply personal. And that inescapability goes heart quarrel's intractability. In glare world attention, it is easy forget that there are fewer people living Israel and Palestinian lands combined there are New York City. In small and jostling confines what few here choose call Holy Land, conflict touches all. Everyone has stake it. Israelis fret daily soldier sons dangerous patrol West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pass sidewalk cafe once ripped Islamic militant's suicide bomb. Palestinian families struggle keep alive memories fathers and brothers languishing Israeli prisons, and chafe checkpoints and gunsights Israeli troops. On sides, youngest soak fear and anger their ABCs. And elders' memories half century still rise trouble collective sleep: shadow Holocaust Israelis, trauma exile and dispossession Palestinians. Against this backdrop, landscape little changed biblical times, terrible Old Testament themes  lamentation and retribution, smiting enemies and sharpening swords  spring life once again any day's headlines. Now comes Clinton, this most American presidents, one who has made Middle East peacemaking kind personal crusade, hopes halting what has become one century's most protracted blood feuds. Clinton is no stranger these particular hatreds. Three years ago, another winter season, he came here bury Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, gunned nationalist Jew who could not abide terms Mideast agreement that called  just this latest accord does  Israel cede West Bank land exchange peace Palestinians. On occasion this visit  first intended celebrate Wye River accords signed seven weeks ago Washington, now meant salvage them  all three principals are embattled. Clinton is impeachment cloud; Arafat is buffeted furious Palestinian street protests and his failing health, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government is hanging thread. The days leading Clinton's visit have been divisive ones, contriving somehow simultaneously tap sides' greatest fears. In West Bank's worst spasm violence months, Israelis watched windows Israeli-plated cars shatter stones thrown angry youths, saw TV footage cringing Israeli soldier  now facing court martial  being beaten bloody Palestinian mob, heard Palestinian officials' exhortations new intefadeh, or uprising. Palestinians, their part, listened anger Netanyahu announced suspension upcoming Israeli troop pullback West Bank and tried vainly halt Israeli bulldozers expanding Jewish settlements land they claim their own. Both sides  Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay  came see visit implicit acknowledgement Palestinian statehood aspirations, increasingly desperate American efforts avoid casting it that light. Clinton's foray Gaza Strip, which is already Palestinian rule, will be first sitting American president. Palestinians intend play that symbolism all it is worth, greeting him strains their once-banned national anthem. In mourning house Abu Dis, though, friends and relatives Nasr Erekat had little say politics and statehood. They talked Nasr instead. Amr Erekat, 27, recalled his disbelief he cradled his dying cousin his arms. His 14-year-old brother Taher spoke haltingly big brother he had looked to. His childhood friend, Samir Abdel Salam, remembered wishing he had stuck his studies diligently Nasr had. Saeb Erekat, peace negotiator, could find neither lesson nor logic his young cousin's death. It's senseless, this rhythm bloodshed, he said. At these difficult times, you pray one thing, sides: no more it. Armored personnel carriers were deployed Tuesday convention center where U.S. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian delegates next week. U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived Gaza work their Palestinian counterparts how protect Clinton his first visit Palestinian areas. There is cooperation American security people. We have our plan. The Americans have their procedures well, said Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali.

The hotel boasts stunning views Jerusalem's walled Old City and slopes Judean Desert. Israel affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troops West Bank unless top Palestinian decision-making body holds vote annul clauses PLO charter calling Israel's destruction. Just day U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also rejected U.S. compromise release Palestinian prisoners, issue that has sparked riots West Bank. The Palestinians have said they would revoke clauses only acclamation, not vote, when Palestine National Council meets Monday Clinton's presence. With its demand, Israel may be setting itself showdown Clinton whose visit Israel and Palestinian is ushering next stage Wye River land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate. Under accord, annulment offending provisions PNC is clear way Israeli troop pullback. Clinton is unlikely declare PNC has not completed its task because that would mean his high-profile visit has been failure. However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand vote. They have vote PNC, said Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will not turn additional West Bank territory Palestinians because transfer territory is irreversible. In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley was evasive whether United States expected vote PNC. The procedures need be clear enough that nullification has taken place, he said. A senior Palestinian official, speaking condition anonymity, said United States has not asked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat consider holding vote. On Thursday, Palestinians took interim step when smaller leadership body, 124-member Palestinian Central Council, declared charter clauses revoked. The 95 members present were asked whether they approved letter which Arafat informed Clinton that charter clauses calling Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 81 voted favor, seven and seven abstained. Asked decision, Arafat would only say that it was very important and constructive meeting. The Palestinian leader also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure Israel keep its obligations Wye agreement. The Palestine Liberation Organization charter was drawn three decades ago, long Israel and Palestinians started their peace process 1993. The Palestinians say they took all required steps revoke pertinent clauses PNC session Gaza 1996. However, Netanyahu has said PNC never completed job. During Wye River talks, Palestinians agreed compromise invite PNC members and delegates other groups Gaza hear Clinton and Arafat speak. The Wye accord says delegates should reaffirm Arafat letter Clinton, does not specifically refer vote. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided Palestinians Friday. They it once, they it twice, they don't have do it again, said Peres, who was prime minister PNC vote 1996. Israel and Palestinians have also accused each other violating other elements Wye agreement. A key point contention has been Israel's pledge release 750 Palestinian prisoners three stages end January. The Palestinians have said Israel broke promise release prisoners held anti-Israeli activities. Israel said it never made such pledge, and accused Palestinian Authority incitement prisoner issue. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said United States offered compromise, trilateral committee go list prisoners one one and determine who will be released. But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such proposal was unacceptable. Israel has not been offered such compromise and there will not be such compromise, Naveh said. On Friday, 2,000 supporters Islamic militant Hamas movement marched West Bank town Nablus press release or prisoners. We want prisoners, not Clinton, crowd chanted. At Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, prayer leader, Yousef Abu Sneineh, spoke out sharply U.S.-brokered peace agreement. America supports peace agreement that further reinforces Israeli occupation Palestinian lands, he said. Less week U.S. President Bill Clinton is arrive visit meant bolster new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, two sides exchanged angry accusations Sunday Jewish settlements and street clashes. Ahmed Qureia, speaker Palestinian parliament, warned possible violence if Israel continues expand settlements West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians hope establish state. If settlement activity continues, then all means resistance are open, Qureia, who is also known Abu Ala, told reporters West Bank town Ramallah. Since signing land-for-security accord, Jewish settlers have accelerated establishment makeshift communities West Bank hilltops, explicit bid keep land being turned Palestinians. Meanwhile, meeting Israeli Cabinet, ministers expressed dismay outbreak street clashes Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops West Bank. The Palestinians have been asked immediately stop violence and incitement violence, Cabinet said statement. At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday confrontation Jewish settlement Ariel northern West Bank. Demonstrators threw stones Israeli troops, who responded rubber bullets and tear gas. A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were injured similar clashes throughout West Bank. And three days that, Israelis were horrified television footage Israeli soldier being dragged car and beaten chunks concrete Palestinian mob. Israel says Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is orchestrating street fighting. The Palestinians deny that. The week's protests grew out increasingly bitter dispute Palestinian prisoners held Israel. Israel last month freed 250 750 prisoners it is release Wye accords, most were criminals. The Palestinians are demanding that so-called security prisoners  those being held anti-Israel activity  be released instead. Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing scheduled meeting Palestinian National Council, Palestinian parliament-in-exile, Gaza Strip Clinton's visit. At gathering, PNC and other Palestinians attendance are reaffirm nullification clauses their national charter that call Israel's destruction. Israel has demanded that Palestinians hold actual vote meeting rather simply proclaiming charter changed, Palestinians Sunday repeated their objections that. They haven't right give us instructions, Arafat said Sunday he returned Gaza trip Europe. Clinton's visit Israel and Palestinian lands, which is begin Saturday, is meant provide impetus U.S.-brokered peace accords and encourage sides stick timetable compliance. But some commentators suggested visit was proving polarizing force instead. He is coming promote peace process... his visit's only actual result is sharpening differences, Yosef Lapid wrote Sunday's editions Maariv newspaper. In Israel, increasing concern is being voiced Clinton's planned visit Gaza, first ever sitting U.S. president. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, shouting match broke out issue, according Israel radio. Who invited President Clinton Gaza Strip? Silvan Shalom, science minister, reportedly yelled Netanyahu. Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his. The United States has repeatedly said visit is not intended endorsement Palestinian statehood, Palestinians see it powerful boost their sovereignty hopes. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said Israeli television that invitation Clinton visit came Israel and was warmly welcomed Palestinians. Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal move peace process forward, which has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered Palestinians, may not be enough his government collapse next week. Netanyahu Wednesday briefed his Cabinet Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told president day earlier  that he would not withdraw troops West Bank Friday, stipulated Wye River peace accord. Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs President Clinton will travel Gaza next month address Palestinian leaders, White House said Friday. He is speak what Palestinians are describing historic meeting formally revoke anti-Israel clauses 1964 Palestinian charter. Israel demanded revocation clauses U.S.-brokered negotiations last month that led latest land-for-peace deal Israel and Palestinians. As part that settlement, reached Wye, Md., Clinton agreed travel territory controlled Palestinian Authority speak meeting Palestinian National Council, de facto parliament. According schedule released Friday White House, Clinton will visit Gaza, West Bank and Israel four-day trip that will begin Dec. 12. He is meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Israel and Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader, returning Washington Dec. 15. Clinton administration officials said White House had not decided whether Clinton would fly newly opened Gaza International Airport Air Force One, given symbolism president's jet landing Palestinian soil trappings state visit. Officials said White House was fearful upsetting Israeli leaders who are worried that president's planned visit Gaza appears be step American recognition Palestinian state. The White House said president would speak Israeli and Palestinian people importance Wye agreement and need continue support Middle East peace process. The meeting Gaza Dec. 14 is bound be contentious, given that many prominent Palestinians have charged that Wye agreement allows Israeli government backtrack promises made Palestinians their 1994 peace settlement. The Palestinians have insisted that they have already revoked clauses 1964 charter that called Israel's destruction. In January, Arafat wrote White House, listing anti-Israel provisions that he said had been annulled. But letter not satisfy Israelis. And talks Maryland last month, Arafat agreed call meeting national council reaffirm decision revoke clauses. In order guarantee passage motion annul provisions, Arafat is being allowed agreement Israelis and United States pack council meeting Gaza his loyalists, and conduct vote show hands instead ballot. During recent interview Israeli television, Clinton brushed aside concerns that his visit Gaza might be seen step U.S. recognition Palestinian state. That is not what I'm doing going there, he said. I have tried strictly adhere position United States that we would not take position any final status issue. He said he was traveling Gaza recommendation of, others, Netanyahu. The prime minister wanted me go there and wanted us all make this pitch, he said, adding that he would ask Palestinian National Council support peace and renounce idea animosity and opposition existence state Israel, and instead embrace path not only peace cooperation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday accused Yasser Arafat making farce Wye River accords and said he would not agree further troop withdrawals halt anti-Israel violence. Netanyahu, interview The Associated Press, said Palestinians were emboldened foment street riots and threaten declare statehood because they believed they had Clinton administration their back pocket. The Palestinians are making farce out Wye River accord. They think they have United States their back pocket, said Israeli leader. As long that is case, they will not change their behavior. Netanyahu said he not believe United States was siding Palestinians, his sharply worded remarks sent strong signal that he would President Bill Clinton intervene and lower Palestinian expectations prior his Dec. 12-15 trip. Palestinians claim it is Israel that has violated summit agreement reached October not freeing jailed political activists, confiscating West Bank land roads and allowing Jewish settlers seize hilltops expansion. Ahmed Qureia, speaker Palestinian Legislative Council and head peace team that negotiated Oslo accords, told reporters Sunday all means resistance was justified opposing settler activity. Netanyahu, who rejected claims settlement expansion bunk, was interviewed Cabinet room meeting his unruly coalition government, which rallied Netanyahu his tough stance. But officials said Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him being too generous Palestinians agreeing Clinton visit next week Gaza and West Bank. We are not going give territory when there are violations agreement and attempts get things that weren't achieved Wye using violence, Netanyahu said. Israel has threatened scrap next Israeli troop pullback, which is scheduled Dec. 18, three days Clinton's departure. The United States has said it should go ahead scheduled. Palestinians see Clinton trip implicit recognition their struggle statehood, though Clinton has specifically said interview aired Israel's Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Netanyahu made clear that he would be annoyed if Air Force One landed newly opened Palestinian airport Gaza, which aides said would be viewed strong symbol support Palestinian demands sovereignty. We will be very disappointed if that is case. We've said United States that we don't think that is necessary, Netanyahu said reports that Clinton's plane would land Gaza. He said traveling motorcade would be quicker and more politically considerate. Unless somebody wants put thumb our eye, I think there are better ways travel, Netanyahu said. In interview, Netanyahu stressed that he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat stop threatening declare independence May 4, 1999, when Palestinians maintain Oslo accords expire. What must be is that Yasser Arafat retracts this open and incipient violation Oslo and Wye River accords and recommits himself negotiating we get white smoke, we get solution. That's only way we'll get real peace Israel and Palestinians, Netanyahu said. In conciliatory speech Sweden weekend, Arafat stressed that he sought negotiated settlement and not mention May 4 deadline. He also said any Palestinian state would not make alliances states hostile Israel  one Netanyahu's key concerns. The Israeli leader is also demanding that Arafat drop claims that Netanyahu promised Wye release 750 Palestinians jailed anti-Israel attacks that resulted bloodshed, rather freeing car thieves and petty criminals. Each side has different interpretation understanding prisoners. Netanyahu maintains he never agreed free those blood their hands. It's high time that Yasser Arafat admits this was agreed and that he's not going make demands Israel, including incitement violence,...on trumped-up charge,  he said. Israel never promised release murders Wye, and it won't release them. The issue has been focal point new wave violent protests and demonstrations West Bank and hunger strike that began Saturday 1,700 Palestinian inmates. Israel is also upset statements that nearly 600-member Palestinian National Council will not reaffirm vote that anti-Israel clauses Palestinian charter have been deleted. Netanyahu maintained that only 25 members out hundreds who live abroad had been invited so far. Netanyahu quoted Clinton telling him that purpose his visit was personally make sure that they actually rescind this charter that calls Israel's destruction. Keeping promise Israel and United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Thursday convened senior officials and legislators revoke clauses PLO founding charter calling Israel's destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he has ordered Israeli army deal Palestinian riots firm hand. He added that he would not go ahead West Bank troop pullback, promised Wye River peace agreement, unless Arafat met list demands. The West Bank has been swept stone-throwing protests recent days, and thousands Palestinians marched Thursday funeral procession 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who was killed Israeli army gunfire day earlier. The violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit region, which is start late Saturday, is fomenting more unrest rather calming already tense situation. Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status Palestinian areas. On Thursday, signs reading Clinton go home were strung Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and walls Jerusalem. The most problematic moment Clinton visit will be his address Monday Palestine National Council, Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, Gaza City. Under Wye agreement, PNC is reaffirm this session Arafat letter Clinton which declares clauses PLO founding charter calling Israel's destruction revoked. Israel insists vote be taken show hands, while Palestinians say only approval acclamation is required. Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle anything less vote, if Clinton declares PNC session success it. It is Israel which determines issues connected its future, Netanyahu said when asked Israel radio whether he would be ready enter showdown Clinton issue. It is unlikely U.S. president would side Israel such dispute because it would mean that main purpose his visit, usher next stage Wye agreement, had failed. Immediately PNC session, Israel is transfer five percent West Bank its sole control joint jurisdiction. Netanyahu said last week he was freezing pullback what he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations peace accord. He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his decision unless Arafat publicly dropped plans unilaterally declare Palestinian state May. The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing excuse excuse walk away agreement because he faces very real threat hard-liners his coalition bring government event another troop withdrawal. The Palestinians, meanwhile, pressed ahead implementing accord. On Thursday, 98 members 124-member Palestinian Central Council met Arafat's seaside headquarters hold vote whether approve Arafat letter PLO charter. The meeting is interim step, ahead Monday's PNC session, and is stipulated Wye agreement. A simple majority 63 members is required, and vote was expected Thursday evening. The council has not met years and was revived specifically Thursday's vote. It consists PNC delegates, members Palestinian legislative council and PLO Executive Committee, others. In atmosphere political tension, U.S. President Clinton met Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu bid put troubled Wye River peace accord back track. After getting together breakfast Clinton's hotel suite, two leaders met Netanyahu's office and planned talk reporters later. The president was sure be asked impeachment drama unfolding Washington. At late-night arrival ceremony Clinton Saturday, Netanyahu said he hoped president's visit would contribute true peace. Again, Israeli leader accused Palestinians ignoring commitments peace accords. Clinton is meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday Gaza Strip. Thousands police were deployed throughout Israel Clinton visit. At hotel where Clinton is staying, 500 policemen were posted guard president and his 600-member delegation. Clinton's wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, set out their schedule. Mrs. Clinton toured school cooperative village Jews and Palestinians, while Chelsea visited Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporters picture-taking session Secretary State Madeleine Albright that Israel has not left Wye River agreement. We will not give land-for-security accord, Sharon said. But, he added, it should be based mutual reciprocity. About two hours Air Force One landed Saturday night, House Judiciary Committee approved fourth article impeachment Clinton. The full House will vote impeachment articles next week. Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel was asked Sunday if success Clinton's visit would turn question revoking Palestinian Liberation Organization's founding charter. President Clinton played very important role Wye Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's going be very, very important that this visit show us least readiness part Palestinian Authority move forward peace, Fogel said. There was no letup violence Sunday. Palestinian stone throwers clashed Israeli troops and Israeli high school student was stabbed and wounded Palestinian teen-ager. In his remarks Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night, Netanyahu said peace process is danger. Mr. President, Netanyahu said, speaking Hebrew, The truth has be told. In recent weeks Palestinians again constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared forgo fulfillment those commitments. Netanyahu, who is facing political turmoil his hard-line coalition government, said he could not accept phony peace paper which is not honored practice. Since Clinton presided its signing Washington October, land-for-security agreement has hit one snag another. Israel froze implementation accord altogether, accusing Arafat violating deal and inciting violent street protests. Clinton said United States shares Israel's concerns security. Peace is not simply option many only choice that can avert still more years bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow, he said. That is why I'm here. He said sides now must face challenge implementing Wye. Both Clinton and Netanyahu have shaky political future. The Israeli leader is fighting his political survival parliament prepares no-confidence vote two weeks. His coalition began weaken he and Arafat signed Wye River Memorandum Oct. 23 agreeing turn 13 percent West Bank territory be met Palestinian security measures. Netanyahu has said there would be no further troop withdrawals West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and Palestinians are also bitter disagreement procedures revoking passages Palestinian charter calling Israel's destruction and release Palestinian prisoners held Israeli jails militant or political acts Jewish state. On Monday, president is fly Palestinian-run Gaza Strip be welcomed Arafat trappings state visit. Clinton's visit Gaza and his address Palestinian National Council is seen some boost dreams Palestinian statehood. It implies de facto recognition Palestinian state, Ziyad Abu Ziyad, member Palestinian legislative council, said interview Sunday. ","Security high for Clinton's visit to Gaza, part of the Wye Accord, as Palestinian leaders revoke a 1964 Israeli destruction clause.Israel claims Air Force One landing in Palestinian is sovereign recognition.It won't withdraw West Bank troops unless Palestinians formally vote to revoke the clause and violence stops.Palestine says Israel violated the Accord by improper prisoner releases, roadbuilding and settlement expansion.It warns of violence and there have been stone-throwing protests.Radical Islam group Hamas denounces the visit and the Accord.Clinton has made ending the long feud a crusade.Both Clinton and Netanyahu's leadership threatened.","Clinton traveled to the mid-East in December in an effort to energize the Wye agreement signed by Israel and Palestine.Problems immediately faced this accord, intended to trade Israeli territory for security.Questions remained on which prisoners should be released and what constituted a vote to revoke a 1964 call to destroy Israel.Jewish settlers continued to take more lands.Violence and demonstrations went on.The Israeli far right was angry.Clinton was facing impeachment hearings.History and hatred were too strong for him to succeed.Netanyahu finally refused to move the peace process forward, but probably still will be voted out of office.","Clinton will visit Israel, Gaza and the West bank Dec. 12-15 as agreed in the Wye River accord.The days preceding his trip are filled with violence, unrest and divisiveness.Hamas denounces Clinton's trip, but makes no threats against him.Netanyahu says Arafat is ""making a farce"" of the Wye accord.The two sides disagree over its terms.The Israelis and Palestinians are troubled by violence, fear and loss.Clinton has impeachment troubles.Extra security is in place wherever Clinton will go.He hopes to salvage the Wye accord.However, Netanyahu continues to withdraw troops from the West Bank as stipulated in the agreement.","Despite concerns it might cause more unrest, President Clinton met in Israel separately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat to negotiate Wye Accord agreement terms.Israel is demanding revocation of anti-Israeli clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter.Palestine is demanding Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners.Both sides are exchanging accusations over Israeli West Bank settlements and anti-Israeli violence.Hamas denounced Clinton's visit but avoided threats.US and Palestinian agents kept the Gaza area secure.In the end, Netanyahu, facing political turmoil, told President Clinton he would not remove his troops from the West Bank."
55,"Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday any votes freed split far-left party, said he will resign if he loses confidence vote expected later this week. We must respect will voters. If we win confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pass baton, Prodi told news conference closing two-day French-Italian summit Florence. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest World War II, was threatened collapse defection its Communist ally. The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, followed perhaps Friday vote confidence that will determine whether 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls. The Communist Refoundation Party provoked crisis withdrawing its support weekend and saying it would not vote his deficit-cutting 1999 budget. But break Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resigned party president Monday, saying party's hardline stance was wrong and dangerous. Prodi was hoping profit break. Politicians have said Prodi is now four votes short 316 votes needed majority Chamber Deputies, lower house. The government has majority Senate Refoundation's support. After his meetings French leaders, Prodi warned that political difficulties threaten progress country is making cleaning its public finances. Prodi's government has held together this long large part because widely shared desire see Italy qualify 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. It qualified earlier this year  leaving disparate allies so clear reason stay together. As it is, Prodi has outlasted all Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years two back-to-back stints 1983 1987. Prodi's is Italy's 55th government World War II. Three days collapse Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling political leaders Monday try reach consensus new government. Following talks, which are expected last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi try again new majority. He could also name new premier, or appoint government technocrats. If Scalfaro feels no candidate is capable mustering majority, he could call early elections. Because president cannot dissolve Parliament last six weeks his term, elections would have be scheduled December. Scalfaro has named Prodi caretaker premier interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked crisis when it withdrew support government 1999 deficit-cutting budget, which it said not do enough stimulate job creation. Despite help breakaway faction Communists, who Sunday formed new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote confidence single vote. Prodi has said he won't take job back unless his new government could stick policies its old one, unlikely scenario given divided Parliament. An alternative Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader Democrats Left, largest party Prodi's coalition. In case so-called technical government, names Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A government technicians would get Italy volatile period approving 1999 budget and launch common European currency, euro, January 1999. Prodi presided cost cuts that got Italy debut European Monetary Union, outlasting all one other post-World War II Italian government process. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost confidence vote Chamber Deputies Friday, and he went presidential palace resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether call early elections or ask Prodi or someone else try forge new majority. The vote lower chamber Parliament 313 confidence motion brought government 312 favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi said immediately his government went down. The swing vote came Prodi's coalition, defecting deputy Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv By one vote, defector its ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government World War II, lost confidence vote Friday Chamber Deputies. Prodi immediately offered his resignation President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him stay caretaker premier while head state decides whether call early elections or ask someone else be premier. The vote, 3rd graf prv Italy's Communists Sunday voted withdraw support Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, move expected trigger collapse one country's longest-lived postwar governments. Prodi had said he would call confidence vote if Communists yanked support. The coalition has majority Communists Senate, has depended them passage key legislation Chamber. MORE Italian politics have long been enlivened baroque feuds and shifting alliances. And that time-honored tradition may have won embattled government Prime Minister Romano Prodi momentary reprieve. A leader Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday protest his party's decision reject government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender majority Parliament. Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists, said Armando Cossuta, chairman Communist Refounding Party, fringe group that broke mainstream Communists they overhauled party collapse Soviet Union 1991. Nevertheless we should do everything possible, last minute, this government and avoid this crisis. Cossuta was clearly unwilling join most hard-line wing his party withdrawing support Prodi and risk being branded having torpedoed first leftist Italian government 50 years. But leader Communist Refounding Party Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seems have no such compunctions. On Friday, he told journalists that he was not worried forcing new elections that could return right power. Sometimes you have take one step back order take two steps forward, he said shrug. Until now, however, communist rank and file have disagreed that view. When Bertinotti forced Prodi offer his resignation last year proposed budget cuts, rank and file protested, and he was forced backpedal. Prodi met Monday President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and coalition leaders devise strategy. He is expected go Parliament Wednesday open debate crisis and seek enough votes budget. Without it, Italian central bank is unlikely cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do get line Germany and other bigger European neighbors introduction Jan. 1 single European currency, euro. But if he gathers enough votes pass budget, Prodi could still be left majority. After two and half years office, his government is second-longest postwar era. But fragile center-left coalition has held together mostly because Italians were united last two years effort reduce spending, inflation and government borrowing meet requirements membership euro plan. Once that goal was achieved last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backers are hoping that enough members Communist Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta coalition. If not, Prodi is faced two unappetizing choices. He can resign and seek new elections, which carry risk bringing opposition power. Or he could seek form new majority Communists seeking alliance small center-right party Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came Prodi's rescue June, when hard-line leftists refused back Prodi NATO expansion. But Prodi has repeatedly said he will govern only center-left majority that elected him 1996. Cossiga also suggested reporters Monday that he would not welcome any invitations join coalition led Prodi. We wouldn't want this majority get stained Monica Lewinsky's dress, he said. By only one vote, center-left prime minister Italy, Romano Prodi, lost confidence vote Parliament Friday and was toppled power. The collapse his government two and half years, second-longest tenure World War II, suggested that chronic political instability that marked Italy decades had sprung back life. Though obliged tender his resignation, Prodi will remain charge caretaker prime minister new government is formed. He may get second chance form new majority, if he does, negotiations that end could take days and weeks, clouding decisions such urgent issues crisis Kosovo. NATO military planners preparing possible air strikes Yugoslavia had expected use key air bases Italy. In his weakened position, Prodi will have difficulty persuading Parliament approve NATO strikes. He will have similar problems passing 1999 budget, which is necessary Italy can cut its lending rates, requirement joining single European monetary unit, euro, Jan. 1. Immediately Friday's vote 313-312, tense and times raucous session, Prodi met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro submit his resignation and discuss his options. In coming days Scalfaro will consult dozens other leaders ascertain whether Prodi has enough lingering support try form new government. If not, president is expected turn another political leader. If no compromise is found, Italy could be plunged early elections. But parties all political stripes may be reluctant push things that far, opinion polls suggest that voters are no more enamored center-right opposition parties they are governing majority. Prodi, economist, is admired his Western allies down-to-earth leader who vowed tame Italy's bloated economy and reckless government borrowing and actually lived his pledge. By raising taxes, lowering interest rates and reducing deficit, Italy met requirements membership euro last spring, feat that only year was considered impossible German and French economists. Prodi was helped healthy global economy and rare consensus industrialists, labor unions and taxpayers, who feared that exclusion euro would condemn Italy Third World status. But his fiscal discipline was not followed reform political system that is inherently fragile. There are more 40 parties Italy, and government's efforts amend constitution introduce two-party system failed. Unless Italian political system changes, Italy is condemned political instability, said Sergio Romano, former diplomat and political science professor. The country needs stability and credibility, and that will never happen long government is hanging thread. In 1996 Prodi won patchwork quilt center-left factions mostly made Catholic moderates and leftists. He relied fringe Marxist group, Communist Refounding Party, majority lower house. And that alliance, fragile beginning, finally frayed breaking point this week. The hard-line leader Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said his party would vote 1999 budget and would also end its 28-month-old pact center-left coalition. That position drove moderate wing Communist Refounding, worried that vote Prodi would open doors center-right government, split away. But 20-odd deputies who defied Bertinotti were not enough squeeze Prodi through. I am not bitter, Prodi said moments his defeat. Even today I received lot support. In end coup de grace was delivered one his own, member coalition. They have won treachery one single person, Sergio Mattarella, deputy Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporters, referring Silvio Liotta, member Italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who heads that party, said Liotta would be expelled. Prodi has said he would not govern any other majority center-left one that elected him 1996. But throughout his tenure, he was forced seek temporary alliances push major policy decisions. He struggled last try keep his original majority intact. On Thursday, effort woo more moderate Communists his side, prime minister, staunch ally United States, warned that he would oppose NATO strike aimed stopping Serbian violence Kosovo unless U.N. Security Council approved attack. Washington maintains that NATO does not need new U.N. resolution order strike. Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly Parliament Italy's second-longest government World War II, threatened collapse defection its Communist ally. The address Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed perhaps Friday vote confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation Party, provoked crisis withdrawing its support weekend and saying it would not vote his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is key Italy's participation European common currency. Prodi has said he would call confidence vote if he lost Communists' support. I've always acted coherence, Prodi said morning meeting President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro crisis. I've never changed strategy and I don't want do political gymnastics. The break Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resigned party president Monday. He said party's desertion Prodi was wrong and dangerous, same time promised follow party line. We are very complicated political crisis which could lead early elections, Cossutta told reporters Monday. And divisions left, this would mean victory right. If crisis comes confidence vote and Prodi loses, he would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is Scalfaro decide what do. He could ask Prodi or someone else form new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something most analysts think unlikely. Working Prodi's favor is fact that few parties think they would stand gain early elections, including Communist Refoundation. There was speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations that would win back communists' grudging support, he has managed do past. Prodi's government has held together this long large part because widely shared desire see Italy qualify participation 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. That happened earlier this year  leaving disparate allies so clear reason stay together. Prodi leads Italy's 55th government World War II. He has outlasted all Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years two back-to-back stints 1983 1987. Refoundation is not part Prodi's center-left coalition, government needs its 34 votes muster majority lower house. It has been difficult ally outset. It broke Prodi NATO expansion earlier this year and sending troops Albania last year. Prodi was forced resign year ago bitter battle spending cuts linked euro. The crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned work, he made steep concessions and promised 35-hour work week. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost confidence vote Chamber Deputies Friday, and he went presidential palace resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether call early elections or ask Prodi or someone else try forge new majority. The vote lower chamber Parliament 313 confidence motion brought government 312 favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi said immediately his government went down. The swing vote came Prodi's coalition, defecting deputy Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv It is autumn Italy, birds are going south, and so it seems could Italian government, bonds compromise and political opportunism that bind small leftist party government came undone Sunday. The latest threat government Prime Minister Romano Prodi came delegates two-day conference Communist Refounding Party voted reject government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling future center-left coalition. Officials prime minister's office said Sunday night that Prodi would meet Monday President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro discuss political turbulence, though not offer his resignation. If Communist Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide resolution, which passed vote 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government time when outcome recent election Germany has already injected note uncertainty future European economic and fiscal policy. Mauro Zani, spokesman Democratic Party Left, main party Prodi's coalition, called decision Communist Refounding misfortune entire country. Passage budget, he said, is essential avoid disaster. Prodi's coalition is loose alliance former Communists, known Democratic Party Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented followers. It is supported Communist Refounding, fringe group hard-line leftists who broke mainstream Communists they overhauled party collapse Communism Eastern Europe. Despite frequent shocks, alliance has held 1996, glued together mainly desire meet fiscal requirements allow Italy adopt single European currency. As Jan. 1 date approaches introduction new money, euro, Italy must cut its key lending rates bring them line those bigger European neighbors, Germany. A rate cut Italian central bank is generally thought hinge passage budget bill. If bill is not passed, negative signals would be sent global financial markets that are already upset because financial crises Asia, Russia and Latin America. On Sunday, Prodi's backers were still hoping that sufficient number Communist Refounding deputies would break ranks and back budget when it comes vote Parliament later this week. If that fails, centrist group that rescued Prodi June similar circumstances and that is led former President Francesco Cossiga announced it would support budget, thus least assuring parliamentary passage. Communist Refounding and its mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have pushed Prodi brink twice before. The party forced him offer his resignation last year proposed budget cuts, then backpeddled party's rank and file protested. In June, hard-line leftists again refused follow prime minister, that time Parliament vote NATO expansion, government muddled help Cossiga's party. But one leaders that centrist group, Clemente Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support government generally, leaving future Prodi's coalition highly uncertain.

1001,"The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue report that finds African National Congress shares blame human rights violations it struggled overcome white rule. The 3,500-page report Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more two years nationwide hearings. South African media released preliminary findings Monday, three days its official release Thursday Pretoria, capital. The release document is milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. The commission, which has power grant amnesty, was tasked promoting reconciliation laying bare what and why apartheid-era atrocities. With ANC now power and facing election mid-1999, condemnation commission could prove damaging its electoral chances and moral standing. There has been no doubt that report's overwhelming blame would be laid white governments and their security forces years scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news reports Monday said Truth Commission would declare apartheid crime humanity and acknowledge that ANC and more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting legitimate struggle former apartheid state. But preliminary findings sent parties last month, commission also said two movements were morally and politically accountable gross rights violations, South African Press Association and South African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding said that ANC policy killing civilians, line military and civilian targets had been blurred, SAPA said. It condemned planting landmines rural areas, execution enemy agents, torture and mistreatment ANC members its exile camps and killing political opponents. It said party must accept responsibility activities ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, accused killings, torture and kidnappings. The commission also said PAC was guilty deaths civilians its strategy 1993 drive white farmers their land so it could be reclaimed blacks. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists Pretoria, would not comment news reports condemnation ANC. I do expect various responses (to report). I do not expect everyone agree. It will lead healthy debate, he said. He said that if commissioners recommends prosecutions anyone abuses, it will be national director prosecutions decide whether proceed. The director is appointed government. The commission's work is designed help us establish rule law South Africa, and establish principle accountability, Omar said. The ANC already has prepared ground negative finding, saying weeks ago that commission had warned that harsh judgments were offing. The ANC was nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, avoid appearing biased. On Monday, it rejected contempt suggestions ANC officials themselves had leaked findings. Constand Viljoen, leader tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said ANC had done so give commission credibility making it more even-handed. Publicly, party has long defended its actions those committed just war. F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid-era president, meanwhile, planned ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating him covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply ruling court, Omar said, added he would regret any court-ordered delay. Facing court challenge, Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, least temporarily, parts its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. de Klerk, illegal acts. De Klerk, 62, who helped negotiate end South Africa's white supremacist government and shared 1993 Nobel Peace Prize President Nelson Mandela that work, had objected finding commission that he was accessory fact bombings headquarters church group and labor federation 1980s. The chairman 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said that although he took such action great reluctance, commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge. He said it would take de Klerk's name out 3,500-page report avoid delaying its release Thursday. It upsets me deeply, he said statement. We have been scrupulously fair de Klerk, and we reject contention that we have been engaged vendetta him. De Klerk's challenge was only part storm criticism prompted leaks report last few days. Within hours commission decision withdraw its findings de Klerk, it was facing possibility new suit  this time ruling African National Congress. The ANC also wants block commission findings its conduct liberation struggle. A spokesman party, Thabo Masebe, said party would seek injunction morning report is officially handed Mandela. While commission's report is expected lay overwhelming blame former white government atrocities, it has also found ANC responsible human-rights violations, including torture and killing spying suspects, bombings civilian areas and killing political enemies, including members rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision de Klerk seems certain damage commission's credibility. The panel, created way putting South Africa's brutal rest expense and political divisiveness trials, has caused controversy start. It has held more 160 hearings throughout country, listening victims and perpetrators seeking amnesty. But many whites say commission is witch hunt aiming humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners general. De Klerk has once forced commission officials court and won apology them calling him liar. Some political analysts said Wednesday's events would only further belief that panel lacks impartiality. The withdrawal findings can't help be seen lack certainty their side, said Sampie Terreblanche, economist and political analyst University Stellenbosch, who has supported commission. Whether we it or not, whole report gets knock this. De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said former president was very confident that he would win when case goes trial March. He is very happy be courts now rather dealing Truth Commission, Steward said. The fact that they agreed withdraw creates definite impression that they specifically concocted case involve Mr. de Klerk negative finding. The ANC has accused commission trying criminalize liberation struggle. Whatever efforts besmirch our struggle denouncing it gross violation human rights, congress said statement. The ANC and millions people who were part this struggle will always be proud what they insure that, process destruction vile system, they not themselves resort vile methods struggle basis that means justified end. There are probably few subjects that get South Africans more excited issue Truth Commission and whether it is worthy cause or waste money. The events last few days have only added debate. For some, Pal Martins, 34, former member ANC's armed wing, fact all sides political spectrum are uproar is good thing. The mere fact that everyone is complaining means that Truth Commission has done its work, he said. But say that too many questions are being raised panel's competence. The whole affair is pale, mockery justice, said Roboy Vonholdt, 56-year-old sheep and ostrich farmer who believes that commission has been theatrical act. We should all turn our backs and move forward. We need them and they need us. Let's all make money and let good economic conditions prevail. The commission's report is supposed be broad and detailed summary South Africa's human rights history, 1960 1994, when elections open all races ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. While de Klerk was alone court Wednesday challenging commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal challenges had led fewer individuals being named rights violators originally planned. Tutu said that more 400 people had been notified that they would be implicated give them chance respond. Some 15 successfully argued themselves out report or could not be reached and were therefore deleted report, he said. The commission is required law give advance notification anyone it intends implicate its report. The commission had been expected say that although de Klerk not order bombings, he subsequently came know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe had been involved, failed report his knowledge police. This could open him criminal prosecution. De Klerk has not applied amnesty this matter or any other. de Klerk has said that when he learned bombings, Vlok and Van der Merwe were already process applying amnesty, and he not think it was necessary report matter. A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will not implicate last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, human rights abuses he threatened court challenge. De Klerk said he would sue block long-awaited final report Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due release Thursday. The man who helped negotiate end apartheid objected finding commission that he was accessory fact bombings 1980s headquarters church group and labor federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, truth panel's chairman, said commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge, and would excise de Klerk's name report avoid delaying its release. It upsets me deeply, Tutu said. We have been scrupulously fair Mr. de Klerk and we reject contention that we have been engaged vendetta him. But we must and will respect courts and his rights constitution. We fought hard those rights and we can be proud South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares them, he said statement. All we are doing is postponing dealing matter, Tutu later told The Associated Press. The name will eventually appear all hoo-ha has died down. De Klerk, reached London, said he could not comment speaking his lawyers because matter was courts. The commission was charged promoting reconciliation laying bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings country more two years, listening victims and perpetrators seeking amnesty. The release 3,500-page report represents milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. De Klerk's challenge was only part storm criticism prompted leaks report. The African National Congress, liberation movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs country, Tuesday angrily rejected finding that it too was guilty human rights violations its armed struggle. The report will be broad and detailed summary South Africa's human rights history, 1960 1994, when all-race elections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. Other threatened legal challenges have led fewer individuals being named rights violators planned, The Star Johannesburg reported Wednesday. In commenting newspaper report, Tutu said that more 400 people had been notified they would be implicated give them chance respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out report, he said. Criminal prosecutions atrocities committed war white rule could drag least six years, top prosecutor said Monday. Key figures implicated human rights abuses Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are investigation, official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters. They include two unnamed generals apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials African National Congress, he said. The remarks d'Oliveira, who recently was appointed deputy national director prosecutions, were clearest signal that criminal cases would be brought figures accused commission gross human rights violations. The commission released its report Oct. 30. It chronicles human rights abuses committed apartheid governments and their operatives well African National Congress and fighting racist system. The issue continuing prosecutions is significant. Many feel that dragging criminal reckonings horrors apartheid era will only prolong bitterness and delay reconciliation. But supporters prosecution feel that denying justice victims is worse evil. On practical level, highly public prosecutions ANC figures could have impact national elections next year, when party will seek consolidate its hold power. The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has called two-year time limit prosecutions; d'Oliveira called period wholly impractical. The prosecutor not name other targets. We have always worked principle that we will prosecute highest rank, he said. The commission has ability grant amnesty those who admit their misdeeds and are found have acted political motives. The report said individuals who have not sought amnesty should be prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela has not sought amnesty. The commission found her accountable human rights violations committed her bodyguards, who report said killed and tortured suspected opponents. Madikizela-Mandela was convicted 1991 kidnapping and being accessory assault four young men. She was sentenced six years jail, paid dlrs 3,200 fine appeal. The ANC official was most prominent anti-apartheid activists. The two generals were implicated Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors are ready move forward pending amnesty application one. Torturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting apartheid need counseling ensure they do not repeat their crimes, expert South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring psychological needs those who carried out human rights abuses could alienate potentially dangerous sector society. We must give attention healing perpetrators, not just sake perpetrators, sake nation whole, he said. The conference, organized Medical Research Council, is examining mental health issues raised Truth Commission, which is charged probing crimes committed all sides anti-apartheid struggle. As commission prepares hand its final report end month, South Africans are examining its painful and traumatic exploration their bloody past. With power grant amnesty many who tortured, bombed or maimed innocent civilians, process has some stage angered people nearly all walks life. Many whites see panel favoring black liberation movements, while many blacks accuse it being too soft former state officials, especially top ranking ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed tolerance dealing all those who have committed crimes, saying that potential wrongdoing existed everyone. We all, entire human race, carry us capacity evil, he said. Many Thursday's speakers touched figure police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail terms totaling more 200 years killing spree that costs dozens lives. De Kock has applied amnesty his crimes. Dan Stein, specialist neurobiology and stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers all sides conflict his sheer banality evil. Many people have found him interviews be ordinary, likeable person, he said man whom subordinates dubbed Prime Evil. Ginn Fourie, physiotherapist whose student daughter was gunned black activists 1993 attack Cape Town bar, said it was necessary help those whose circumstances compelled them do wrong. Struggling control her tears, Fourie told delegates she had attended amnesty hearings her daughter's killers and supported their successful bid be freed long jail sentences. After describing how she hugged three members black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress and urged them seek counseling together their victims, Fourie earned standing ovation 50-strong audience. We must take initiative understanding and start process reconciliation and healing our broken land, she said, her voice shaking emotion. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released Thursday, is most comprehensive and unsparing examination nation's ugly that any such commission has produced. Drawing commission's investigations and testimony hundreds applicants amnesty and 20,000 victims, report is detailed look crimes apartheid era, and blames successive white governments vast majority. It has fulfilled its mandate telling fullest truth possible, which is one reason that every political party South Africa has denounced it. Besides accusing government assassinations and bombings, report criticizes Inkatha Freedom Party its massacres and collaboration security forces, and blames African National Congress murder civilians and other crimes. It singles out former President P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, and Winnie Mandela, others, detailed treatment their roles political crimes. One major flaw report is absence section accusing F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid president, knowing several bombings fact and keeping silent. It was excised because de Klerk is suing commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, stop publication. The lawsuits are disappointing sign that South Africa's political parties are not interested honest look their past, nor free flow information. The controversy has added widespread complaints that commission has not helped process reconciliation. This is wrong. True reconciliation  which occurs when society is no longer paralyzed and people can work and live together  cannot be based silence. No society can be restored health papering much pain South Africans have suffered. A noisy and informed debate complicity crimes apartheid era is necessary, if uncomfortable. The report is only part Truth Commission's contribution healing process. The hearings themselves, which allowed victims human rights violations tell their stories public, helped country heal and opened eyes many whites unpleasant truth apartheid. The amnesty process, while permitting many important criminals escape justice, is allowing families know exactly what happened their loved ones dozens cases that would likely have never gone trial South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process helping victims scholarships and other necessary aid goes on, although it will not be enough. No commission can transform society twisted South Africa's was. But Truth Commission is best effort world has seen, and South Africa is better it. The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply amnesty and you will go free. If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. After more two years hearings apartheid-era atrocities, commission last week unveiled 3,500-page report naming dozens people it believes were their elbows gore never applied amnesty. So prosecutions should begin soon, right? Not so fast. The study was barely hands President Nelson Mandela talk new amnesty deals had begun. It seems that nearly all South Africa's political parties  including ruling African National Congress  have key officials who could end dock because report. Suddenly, there is lots talk how country can't withstand politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here are betting that agreement mutual benefit is offing. Already, three major political parties are calling some kind new amnesty, and ANC isn't closing door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was premature talk general amnesty, he acknowledged that party was discussing amnesty specifically tailored violence black South Africans other blacks that littered KwaZulu/Natal province bodies late '80s and '90s. In choosing truth commission rather Nuremberg-style trial which close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean and receive true forgiveness. Society would then be able move on, its wounds cleansed and healed. It was model watched closely world other societies wondering how disentangle themselves grudges brutal past. But given chance, hundreds South Africa's perpetrators not come forward. Commission officials themselves say they were frustrated lack cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. It is perhaps too late, however, press more. Today's South Africa has urgent new problems deal  unemployment, crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind settling more pragmatic reconciliation  one that gives amnesty unrepentant simply because it's more practical all concerned move on. In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South Africa's  biggest and most powerful, able grant amnesty and subpoena witnesses  was supposed be real test. Certainly commission forced nation see gruesome details its past, sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers told smashed genitals and suffocations. And commission's work added much knowledge what happened South Africa 1960 and 1994. But it will be years effect commission can truly be judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist? No one can answer. One thing seems clear, however: Four years South Africa held its first non-racial elections, growing number South Africans want be done past. Raymond Louw, publisher respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, says new amnesty proposal could come February session Parliament, time remove issue next year's election campaigns. You simply can't have this country torn apart prosecutions, he says. Everybody is going be howling amnesty. They already are. Even Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commission's chairman, delivered report, he seemed be anticipating push new amnesty and arguing it. He said such move would be highly unfair those who came forward. He suggested instead that there be two-year time limit, which anyone not indicted would effect get amnesty. To be sure, there will be opposition any proposals limit prosecutions. More dozen human rights and victims advocacy groups have already banded together condemn such proposals unconscionable. The idea Truth Commission emerged compromise long negotiations that brought South Africa's peaceful transition white supremacist state non-racial democracy. During talks, white National Party government pushed blanket amnesty, and ANC refused. In end, only 250 former police officers came forward, most them foot soldiers. And only two high National Party officials, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed  roles ordering bombings. In its report, commission called apartheid state primary perpetrator gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former officials former President P.W. Botha, his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, and lower rank, have not applied amnesty For ANC, most embarrassing prospect is possible prosecution Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who is accused report taking part number assaults and abductions. Lesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC is held responsible least 76 deaths KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems are further complicated its efforts make peace largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually no one that party came forward ask amnesty. Yet report found that Inkatha, working white government, was responsible widespread slaughter KwaZulu/Natal and townships Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand accused fomenting wide range abuses. But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead new warfare KwaZulu. Part reluctance go forward prosecutions may be result still another factor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed rising crime and evidence apartheid era is old. So why spend time and money? At moment, only one political party is opposed any form new amnesty  tiny influential Democratic Party, liberal group that was not involved violence. Its head, Tony Leon, says new amnesty would only prove that more thuglike your behavior, more you get away with. But he concedes that his is lonely voice. At this point, he says, there is little enthusiasm anything closing book past. A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused African National Congress human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, which led struggle white rule and now is power, previously has acknowledged it was told expect implication right violations. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report 2 1-2 years investigation Thursday. The report was expected place overwhelming blame era's abuses white governments and their brutal security services. President Nelson Mandela's office received advance copy Monday ahead handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who chaired comission, will present Mandela report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked preliminary document which condemns ANC politically and morally responsible gross human rights violations and fall apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed news report referred commission letter sent advance informing us its intention implicate ANC gross human rights violations. Commission officials could not immediately be reached comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists Pretoria he had heard news report, would not comment. Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating him covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply ruling court, Omar said, added he would regret any court-ordered delay. The ANC was nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, avoid appearing embarrassed. The party says accusations it likely would center planting land mines border farms, abuses its military camps Angola and bombings. Omar said he expected report's conclusions set debate added it would lay basis reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday African National Congress violated human rights apartheid, setting him odds his deputy president report that has divided much South Africa. The disagreement stems Thursday's release report Truth and Reconciliation Commission horrors committed apartheid. Rather act salve and aid reconciliation, report has caused divisiveness, former comrades-in-arms who fought apartheid. As expected, report called apartheid crime humanity. But it also blamed ANC gross human rights violations its anti-apartheid struggle, saying group tortured suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent civilians land mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors were killed ANC's camps abroad. Mbeki  who became ANC president last year and will likely be elected South Africa's next president 1999 when Mandela retires  took hard line Saturday report, and indicated all ANC members must do same. No member, 5th graf, 1st Ld-Writethru Following are excerpts final report issued South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On basis evidence available it, primary finding Commission is that: The predominant portion gross violations human rights was committed former state its security and law-enforcement agencies. Moreover, South African state period late 1970's early 1990's became involved activities criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly planned, undertook, condoned and covered commission unlawful acts, including extrajudicial killing political opponents and others, and South Africa. In pursuit these unlawful activities, state acted collusion certain other political groupings, most notably Inkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.). . . . Certain members State Security Council (the state President, Minister Defense, Minister Law and Order, and heads security forces) foresee that use words such take out, wipe out, eradicate, and eliminate would result killing political opponents. They are therefore responsible deliberate planning which caused gross violations human rights. P.W. BOTHA During period that he presided head state (1978-1989) according submissions made and findings made Commission, gross violations human rights and other unlawful acts were perpetrated wide scale members South African Defense Force, including: The deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing persons opposed policies Government, and South Africa. The widespread use torture and other forms severe ill treatment such persons. The forcible abduction such persons where were resident neighboring countries. Covert logistical and financial assistance organizations opposed ideology A.N.C. and other liberation movements. . . . INKATHA The Commission finds that 1986, South African Defense Forces (S.A.D.F.) conspired Inkatha provide latter covert, offensive paramilitary unit (or hit squad) be deployed illegally persons and organizations perceived be opposed South African Government and Inkatha. The S.A.D.F. provided training, financial and logistical management and scenes supervision trainees, who were trained Special Forces unit S.A.D.F. Caprivi Strip. The Commission finds furthermore that deployment paramilitary unit KwaZulu led gross violations human rights, including killing, attempted killing and severe ill treatment. The Commission finds people, others, accountable such violations: Mr. P. W. Botha, Gen. Magnus Malan, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. . . . The A.N.C. While it was A.N.C. policy that loss civilian life should be avoided, there were instances where members its security forces perpetrated gross violations human rights that distinction military and civilian targets was blurred certain armed actions, such 1983 Church Street bombing South African Air Force headquarters. . . . In course armed struggle, A.N.C., its security forces, undertook military operations which, though intended military or security force targets, sometimes went awry variety reasons, including poor intelligence and reconnaissance. The consequences these cases, such Magoo's Bar and Durban Esplanade bombings, were gross violations human rights respect injuries and loss lives civilians. Individuals who defected state and became informers and/or members who became state witnesses political trials . . . were labeled A.N.C. collaborators and regarded legitimate targets be killed. The commission does not condone legitimization such individuals military targets and finds that extrajudicial killings such individuals constituted gross violations human rights. The commission finds that, 1980's particular, number gross violations were perpetrated not direct members A.N.C. or those operating its formal command, civilians who saw themselves A.N.C. supporters. In this regard, Commission finds that A.N.C. is morally and politically accountable creating climate which such supporters believed their actions be legitimate and carried out broad parameters people's war enunciated A.N.C. A.N.C. CAMPS The Commission finds that suspected agents were routinely subjected torture and other forms severe ill treatment and that there were cases such individuals being charged and convicted tribunals proper regard due process, sentenced death and executed. WINNIE MADIKIZELA-MANDELA The Commission finds that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was central establishment and formation Mandela United Football Club, which later developed private vigilante unit. It is Commission's view that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was aware criminal activity and disquiet it caused community, chose deliberately not address problems emanating football club. The Commission finds that those who opposed Ms. Madikizela-Mandela and Mandela United Football Club, or dissented them, were branded informers and killed. The Commission finds that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela . . . is accountable, politically and morally gross violations human rights committed Mandela United Football Club. The Commission finds further that Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela herself was responsible committing such gross violations human rights. . . . BUSINESS Business was central economy that sustained South African state apartheid years. Certain businesses, especially mining industry, were involved helping design and implement apartheid policies. The white agriculture industry benefited its privileged access land. ","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed to reconcile the sides involved in the crimes of the apartheid era, is releasing its final 2.5- year report.Its purpose is to identify those who committed gross violations of human rights.The report is to lay most of the blame for the violations on the State, but the ANC also shares blame.The program offers amnesty to the accused if they confess but execution if they refuse.The process has angered many people of all walks of life.De Klerk, Apartheid's last president, is not being implicated but he is suing to stop publication.Criminal cases are nonetheless expected to go on for six years.","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Desmond Tutu proposes amnesty to heal the wounds of the apartheid era.If those accused of atrocities confess, they will be given amnesty, if not, they will be prosecuted.The Commission's report said most human rights violations were by the former state through security and law enforcement agencies.The African National Congress, Inkatha Freedom Party, and Winnie Mandela's United Football Club also shared guilt.Former president de Klerk, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, was not named as an accessory after the fact, since his threatened lawsuit would delay the report.","South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 3,500-page report on apartheid-era atrocities was issued on Oct 30.This report was intended to clear the air, grant amnesty to those who confessed, and begin the healing process.Those named for prosecution were warned before the release.Ex-prime minister de Klerk's name was removed.The ruling African National Congress remained.While the white government bore the brunt of the blame, several black movements were included.After the release many talked of a new amnesty period or a limited time to prosecute.Prosecutions could take 6 years; diverting judges, threatening elections, and slowing recovery.","The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established to look into the human rights violations committed during the long struggle against white rule, released its final report.In what has been described as one of the most complete reports of its kind, the commission blames most of the atrocities on the former South African government.The ANC also came under fire for committing some atrocities during the struggle.Nelson Mandella's ex-wife, Winnie could be prosecuted for the part she played in such violations.Missing from the report was De Klerk, who threatened to sue if he was mentioned in connection with the atrocities."

The fraternity chapter immediately suspended seven members and said they had acted independently.

In response killing, 50 candelight vigils were scheduled this week, Texas Vermont, Wayne, Neb., New York City. At Poudre Valley Hospital Fort Collins where Shepard was intensive care five days, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, received 6,000 electronic messages condolences.

Friends University Wyoming Laramie, Wyo., have set The Matthew Shepard Memorial Fund raise money pressure state legislature pass anti-hate crime legislation. I see his name going gay history catalyst renewed activism, said Matt Foreman, former Wyomingite who directs Empire State Pride Agenda, gay political organization New York. From nation Tuesday, gay leaders stressed that campus homophobia is not restricted college towns Rocky Mountain West. Last year, survey almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school students, 22 percent gay respondents said they skipped school month because they felt unsafe school, and 31 percent said they had been threatened or injured school year. These percentages were five times greater percentages heterosexual respondents. The survey was conducted 58 high schools Massachusetts Department Education. In separate study nearly 500 community college students San Francisco area, 32 percent male respondents said they had verbally threatened gay people and 18 percent said they had physically threatened or assaulted gay people. The study was conducted this year Karen Franklin, forensic psychologist who is researcher University Washington. Surveys gay college students conducted late 1980s Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and Penn State found that 16 percent 26 percent had been threatened violence, and that 40 percent 76 percent had been verbally harassed, said National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, lobbying group based Washington. Last year, student group Des Moines, Iowa, called Concerned Students, recorded hallway and classroom conversations five high schools 10 homophobia recording day. They estimated that average Des Moines high school student hears 25 anti-gay remarks every day. Nine out 10 `teaching tolerance' courses weed out gays, Foreman said. There are lot people preaching anti-racism and anti-semitism. But it is still very much OK make anti-gay jokes, express anti-gay sentiments. In survey nation's 42 largest school districts, 76 percent do not train teachers issues facing gay students, and 42 percent do not have policies protect students discrimination based sexual orientation, said Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, which conducted survey last month. In Fort Collins, while hospital officials struggled electronic avalanche condolences, city police detectives were investigating different kind e-mail. On Monday, hours Shepard's death, two gay organizations, Rainbow Chorus and Lambda Community Center, received identical messages applauding Shepard's murder. The messages closed words: I hope it happens more often. Matthew Shepard, gay college student who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days he was found unconscious Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied fence 18 hours near-freezing temperatures. His death, announced Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned outrage that followed word last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing call federal hate-crimes legislation President Clinton and fueling debates such laws host Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted them. From Denver University Maryland, people turned out honor The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, freshman University Wyoming, who became overnight symbol anti-gay violence he was found dangling fence passerby. Two men and two women have been charged case. The men were charged attempted murder and are expected face first-degree murder charges that could bring death penalty. There is incredible symbolism being tied fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political director National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Washington. People have likened it scarecrow. But it sounded more crucifixion. Gay leaders hope  and Christian conservatives fear  that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights another. In last two decades, 21 states and District Columbia have passed laws that increase penalties crimes that are committed because person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual orientation their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws all. In Washington, Clinton responded news Shepard's death urging Congress pass federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses crimes based sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming has been one nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills 1994, most recently February. But Monday, Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed lawmakers reconsider their opposition. I ask collective suggestion anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be presented Wyoming Legislature their consideration January, Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning Dennis Shepard, slain student's father, and said that elder Shepard not want his son's death become media circus and that we should not use Matt further agenda. Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: Don't rush just passing all kinds new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful any changes and be sure you're not taking away rights process race this. Leaders gay rights groups interviewed Monday said they would respect family's privacy not attending burial Casper, Wyo., Saturday. But they added that they hoped death would have impact legislators nation. Matthew's death, I hope, will bring better and deeper understanding hate crime laws, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director Human Rights Campaign, lesbian and gay rights group that has 250,000 members. Matthew's death may lead awakening Wyoming and United States Congress need this legislation. In 1996, 21 men and women were killed United States because their sexual orientation, according Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama group that tracks violence minorities. According FBI, sexual orientation was factor 11.6 percent 8,759 hate crimes recorded 1996. But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want use Shepard's death expand hate rights laws and curtail freedom speech. Hate crimes laws have nothing do perpetrators violent crime and everything do silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, analyst Family Research Council, Washington group dedicated defending faith, family and freedom. It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said. This basically sends message that you can't disagree political message homosexual activists. Agreement came John Paulk, who was featured this summer series advertisements how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality religious conversion. We have every right speak out agenda that is contrary Biblical norms, said Paulk, who describes himself homosexuality specialist Focus Family, Christian group Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we are standing and opposing homosexual agenda, we are being looked advocating violence homosexuals, when we categorically reject violence homosexuals. Last Thursday, Family Research Council unveiled series television advertisements that preach healing homosexuality religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements help create hostile climate homosexuals, climate that can lead violence. Hate crime laws that are books 40 states have not impinged freedom speech, said Brian Levin, criminal justice professor who directs Center Hate and Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send clear message that society does not tolerate attacks minorities. We want deter broken windows and simple assaults they escalate, he said. Referring murders homosexuals, he added: These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if they are not punished first time. Levin said that his research indicated that homosexuals suffered higher rates violent crime population large. He also said that roughly half people who attack homosexuals are male, aged 22 or younger. The two men charged killing Shephard are white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22. With other crimes, violence is means end. With hate crimes, violence becomes unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered dozen cuts head, face and neck, well massive blow back his skull. Because their social stature society, gays are viewed appropriate targets, Levin added. Citing need hate crime laws send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leaves many these people believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable. While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery Shepard's death, saw different symbolism: Old West practice nailing dead coyote ranch fence warning future intruders. This University Wyoming student was beaten and left die, tied fence animal because he was honest and open being gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply fault deranged, isolated individuals. His attackers are millions Americans who constantly hear message that gay people are not worthy most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. On same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung animal and left die fence Laramie, Wyo., Family Research Council was co-hosting press conference Washington. It was latest salvo six-month campaign religious right, tacit, explicit, approval Republican leaders, demonize gay people political gain this election year. This particular press conference was announce new barrage ads  TV follow-up summer print campaign  which alleged former homosexuals who have changed implore do likewise power Jesus Christ. The commercials, gooey style, end slogan: It's not hate ... It's hope. But it's really stirring fear that produces hate. If these ads were truly aimed gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast extravagant cost wide general audience reached TV, and they wouldn't be trumpeted Washington, insuring free national exposure, three weeks Election Day. The ads themselves, sugar-coating hope, ooze malice. In one them, homosexuality is linked drug addiction and certain death AIDS; all them implicitly posit that homosexuality is itself disease need cure. Matthew Shepard has now been cured, that's sure. As his uncle, R.W. Eaton, told The Denver Post, 21-year-old Matt, who aspired career diplomacy and human rights, was small person big heart, mind and soul that someone tried beat out him. Of his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, It's something you might see war. And war it is. Go Family Research Council's Web site and you will find proud description its readiness wage war homosexual agenda and fight maintain traditional meaning `family.' The head Family Research Council is Gary Bauer, GOP power broker and putative presidential candidate, who disingenuously goes talk shows say that his organization hates no one and deplores violence. But if you wage well-financed media air war which people innate difference sexual orientation are ceaselessly branded sinful and diseased and un-American seekers special rights, ground war will follow. It's story old history. Once any group is successfully scapegoated subhuman threat normal values propaganda machine, emboldened thugs take over. Two weeks James Byrd was savagely dragged his death pickup truck Texas June, I wrote column ugly incident GOP state convention Fort Worth, where mob threatened group gay Log Cabin Republicans who were protesting discriminatory treatment their party. The gay-bashers had been directly preceded steady saber-rattling Republican politicians: Sen. James Inhofe Oklahoma had likened James Hormel, gay nominee ambassadorship, David Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered TV if God might wreak havoc Disney World its Gay Days; Texas GOP spokesman had likened Log Cabin Ku Klux Klan. Just two days this near-brush violence Fort Worth, Trent Lott was TV seconding religious right's condemnation gay people sinful and sick. A frightened gay Texas Republican who had been convention melee asked when I interviewed him then: Do you have have someone hurt and beat and dragged truck stop this? Months later not murder Laramie has moved Lott apologize his words, and still no major GOP leader dares take its religious wing and its crusade people Matthew Shepard. In one new ads that supposedly hate-free crusade, ostensibly loving mother condemns her son bad choice being gay. Is it that mother who speaks American values, or is it Matthew's? Go home, give your kids hug, Judy Shepard said message read tearful hospital spokesman who announced her child's death early Monday morning, and don't let day go telling them you love them. At first, passing bicyclist thought crumpled form lashed ranch fence was scarecrow. But when he stopped, he found burned, battered and nearly lifeless body Matthew Shepard, openly gay college student who had been tied fence 18 hours earlier. On Friday, 22-year-old University Wyoming student was coma critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned charges kidnapping, aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. Two women described friends men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have been charged accessories fact attempted first-degree murder. Shepard's friends said that he not know his alleged tormentors. Laramie police say primary motive was robbery, although court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality may also have been factor. Shepard's friends call attack hate crime. He was very open his sexuality, Tina LaBrie, anthropology student here, said her friend. I admired him that because it is very courageous be yourself when disagree. A few hours he was beaten, Shepard, slight 5-foot, 2-inch man who wore braces his teeth, had attended meeting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, friend Shepard's. He was sitting bar, having beer, when two men came and talked him, Boulden, 46-year-old university lecturer social work here, said today tears. He indicated he was gay, and they said they were gay, too. Now, he is coma, continued Boulden, who visited his friend hospital Fort Collins, Colo., Thursday. I don't think anybody expects him pull through. Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied boarding school Switzerland moving back United States attend University Wyoming, alma mater his father, oil rig safety inspector Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard was born Casper, capital Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much his youth there. But six weeks returning Wyoming and enrolling freshman here, Shepard fell depression, said Ms. Labrie and her husband, Phillip.

Set treeless landscape defined barbed wire fences, grazing cattle and busy freight railroad line, Laramie is town where pickup trucks outnumber sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolves this Saturday's homecoming football game and start hunting season nearby Medicine Bow mountains. Although Wyoming bills itself equality state, reference its being first state give women vote, state legislature has repeatedly voted hate crime legislation grounds that it would give homosexuals special rights. Wyoming is not really gay friendly, Marv Johnson, executive director Wyoming chapter American Civil Liberties Union, said Cheyenne. The best way characterize that is comment legislator made few years back, when he likened homosexuals gay bulls worthless and should be sent packing plant. Shepard joined campus gay association university days. One his favorite haunts was Fireside Bar, which drew mixed crowd college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and straights. He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in, recalled bartender, Matt Galloway. He wasn't drunk when he went out.

Shepard, some said, may have felt false sense confidence because local Gay Association completed plans Tuesday night Gay Awareness Week 1998. The weeklong series events starts here Sunday local observance National Coming Out Day and lecture Monday Leslea Newman, author Heather Has Two Mommies, book lesbian families. If I were homosexual Laramie, I would hang low, very low, said Carla Brown, manager Fireside. Openly gay behavior is not only discouraged, it's dangerous.

Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard bar saying they too were gay and one their girlfriends said Shepard had embarassed one men making pass him. Monday, police said that leaving Shepard tied fence, men returned Laramie and picked fight street corner two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy Herrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries brawl; McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment same hospital where Shepard died. Gay leaders hope  and Christian conservatives fear  that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights another. In last two decades, 21 states and District Columbia have passed laws that increase penalties crimes that are committed because person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual orientation their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws all. In Washington, Clinton responded news Shepard's death urging Congress pass federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses crimes based sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming has been one nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills 1994, most recently February. But Monday, Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed lawmakers reconsider their opposition. I ask collective suggestion anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be presented Wyoming Legislature their consideration January, Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning Dennis Shepard, slain student's father, and said that elder Shepard not want his son's death become media circus and that we should not use Matt further agenda. Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: Don't rush just passing all kinds new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful any changes and be sure you're not taking away rights process race this. Leaders gay rights groups interviewed Monday said they would respect family's privacy not attending burial Casper, Wyo., Saturday. But they added that they hoped death would have impact legislators nation. Matthew's death, I hope, will bring better and deeper understanding hate crime laws, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director Human Rights Campaign, lesbian and gay rights group that has 250,000 members. Matthew's death may lead awakening Wyoming and United States Congress need this legislation. In 1996, 21 men and women were killed United States because their sexual orientation, according Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama group that tracks violence minorities. According FBI, sexual orientation was factor 11.6 percent 8,759 hate crimes recorded 1996. But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want use Shepard's death expand hate rights laws and curtail freedom speech. Hate crimes laws have nothing do perpetrators violent crime and everything do silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, analyst Family Research Council, Washington group dedicated defending faith, family and freedom. It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said. This basically sends message that you can't disagree political message homosexual activists. Agreement came John Paulk, who was featured this summer series advertisements how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality religious conversion. We have every right speak out agenda that is contrary Biblical norms, said Paulk, who describes himself homosexuality specialist Focus Family, Christian group Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we are standing and opposing homosexual agenda, we are being looked advocating violence homosexuals, when we categorically reject violence homosexuals. Last Thursday, Family Research Council unveiled series television advertisements that preach healing homosexuality religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements help create hostile climate homosexuals, climate that can lead violence. Hate crime laws that are books 40 states have not impinged freedom speech, said Brian Levin, criminal justice professor who directs Center Hate and Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send clear message that society does not tolerate attacks minorities. We want deter broken windows and simple assaults they escalate, he said. Referring murders homosexuals, he added: These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if they are not punished first time. Levin said that his research indicated that homosexuals suffered higher rates violent crime population large. He also said that roughly half people who attack homosexuals are male, aged 22 or younger. With other crimes, violence is means end. With hate crimes, violence becomes unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered dozen cuts head, face and neck, well massive blow back his skull. Because their social stature society, gays are viewed appropriate targets, Levin added. Citing need hate crime laws send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leaves many these people believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable.

This University Wyoming student was beaten and left die, tied fence animal because he was honest and open being gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply fault deranged, isolated individuals. His attackers are millions Americans who constantly hear message that gay people are not worthy most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. Matthew Wayne Shepard, gay student who was beaten dead night, tied fence and left die alone, was mourned his funeral Friday 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded, his cousin, Rev.

Judging world's response, she said, Matt will have made difference lives thousands. As first snowstorm fall blanketed Casper, fresh flowers filled red brick church here where Shepard had been baptized teen-ager and where he once wore white robes Episcopal acolyte. There is image that comes mind when I reflect Matt that wooden cross rail fence, said Rev. Royce Brown, pastor St. Mark's, eulogy. I replace that image that another man hung cross. When I concentrate that man, I can release bitterness inside. Shepard, 21-year-old freshman University Wyoming, had dreamed working one day human rights. In death, he has become national catalyst new drive guarantee gay people right physical safety. His death hit nerve nation this week, eliciting dozens candlelight vigils and rallies tolerance, several statements sadness President Clinton, and congressional resolution.

Thursday's vote put motion agenda will be indication government's chances survival, which are said be extremely slim. If approved, legislature will debate motions Monday and hold no-confidence vote Wednesday. The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz having ties organized crime and tampering privatization state bank. He denies charges. Ousting government power will open way struggle gangs, said Lutfu Esengun, deputy Islamic Virtue Party, which presented one three no-confidence motions Parliament. On Wednesday, 6th graf pvs After failing bring together political rivals coalition, Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he was returning his mandate Turkish president. In statement reported Anatolia news agency, Ecevit said he would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday morning. Ecevit, veteran leftist, was called form cabinet two weeks ago Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed no-confidence vote Parliament. Deputies accused Yilmaz, who has been serving acting premier, entertaining ties mob and tampering sale state bank. Refusing any alliance pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party Parliament, Ecevit was unable create political alliance strong enough survive confidence vote deeply divided legislature. Ecevit tried vain form coalition government two rival center-right wing parties -- one led Yilmaz, other former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate efforts make minority coalition backing his Democratic Left Party Parliament also failed. Demirel will now have either ask someone else try form government or wait Jan. 10, when constitution allows him appoint caretaker cabinet lead country parliamentary elections, now scheduled April. Such cabinet would not have face confidence vote. Or Demirel could choose leave current caretaker government, headed Yilmaz, power elections. Bulent Ecevit, who was asked form new government Wednesday, is former prime minister best remembered ordering invasion Cyprus 1974 that made him overnight hero home. The invasion, short-lived coup supporters union Greece, has led division island. Throughout years, Ecevit, 73, has remained strong defender cause Turkish Cypriots As long Turkey lives, we won't allow oppression and subordination Turkish Cypriots hands Greek Cypriots, he said July 1997 23rd anniversary celebrations invasion. Ecevit, who was prime minister three times 1974, has years shed some socialist idealism he was known 70s. During his tenure deputy prime minister 17-month government that was toppled last week corruption scandal, he gave his backing liberal policies center-right-led coalition. He said he was carrying out duty bring stable government and spare Turkey crisis - reference tensions previous Islamic-led government and secular military. Though never Marxist, Ecevit was his early years viewed suspicion big business espousing socialism based heavy government social benefits and strong role state sector economy. Recently, however, he has helped government keep good terms IMF, which ordered strict curb public spending, and approved number state sell-offs. Under his leadership 70's, ties United States were tense. He has also expressed concern U.S.-led multinational force based Turkey that monitors no-fly zone Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. He argues it it is helping create Kurdish state. His frequent visits Iraq meet President Saddam Hussein have turn raised suspicion Washington. Despite short alliance Islamic party 1974, he is staunch defender Turkey's secular traditions and pushed crackdown Islamic radicalism. Ecevit was born Istanbul 1925, intellectual family and studied literature prestigious American-run high school. He has taken some courses Harvard University. A former journalist, he entered politics 1957, rising leadership Republican People's Party 1972, becoming prime minister 1974, briefly 1977 and again 1978-79.

He was imprisoned three times carrying political activities ban, mainly his wife 51 years, Rahsan, who formed Democratic Left Party 1985 and led it democratic reform 1987 allowed Ecevit back politics. In corruption-tainted Turkish politics, he remains known leader cleanest slate. Not his alliance Yilmaz who was ousted alleged ties mob and rigging privatization bank, tarnished his image. The chances new, strictly secular government Turkey faded Wednesday when potential coalition partner insisted giving Islamic party share power. The military, self-appointed guardians Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed inclusion Islamic Virtue, largest party parliament. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties hammer together secular coalition, Tansu Ciller, ex-premier who commands 99 votes parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday. Ecevit already has support her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head other center-right party. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she would not join forces Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 25 mafia scandal. Instead, she reiterated her demand government that would include Virtue. We do not oppose Mr. Ecevit's premiership. We will support him, only if all parties represented Parliament are included, Mrs. Ciller said. It was not clear what Ecevit's next move would be. He might try form fragile minority coalition. He might also admit defeat and return task forming government President Suleyman Demirel. Demirel could then choose any member parliament head government elections April. ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz Wednesday faced intense pressure step allegations that he interfered privatization contract and helped businessman linked mobster secure loans. Deniz Baykal, leader center-left Republican party whose backing parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said he would withdraw his support unless premier resigned immediately. Two opposition parties threatened press motion censure government. The allegations were made businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, economy minister, had encouraged him buy state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans other state banks ensure that his offer was highest bid. Yigit's allegations were carried Tuesday night two his TV channels which showed videotape he had made explain his version story his detention Monday evening questioning bidding. Yigit bought bank public auction August dlrs 600 million. The government suspended privatization last month lawmaker released audio tape conversation supposedly Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici. On that earlier tape, Cakici was heard assuring Yigit that he will fend rival bidders. It was not clear who made tape, which got hands opposition deputy. Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware Cakici's involvement bidding bank urged him nevertheless go ahead bidding. Yilmaz has said that intelligence report revealing Yigit's ties Cakici only reached him Yigit won tender. Yigit said premier had also encouraged him buy mass-circulation national newspaper Milliyet, apparently ensure paper's backing his center-right Motherland party elections next year. Milliyet's sale Yigit was canceled scandal. Cakici was arrested France August. Turkey has requested his extradition. Last month State Minister Eyup Asik resigned allegations he had been close contact Cakici. Turkey's latest premier-designate got backing two key secular parties Monday his efforts form broad-based, coalition government, condition that his government stick Turkey's secular principles. The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support Yalim Erez. News reports said Virtue was holding out number Cabinet seats that reflected its standing largest party parliament. We are neither saying `yes' nor saying `no' this point, Virtue leader Recai Kutan said. Erez denied that two had discussed Cabinet posts. Erez, independent lawmaker, is trying form coalition government that would include Cabinet members several parties, including Virtue. The coalition would run country only parliamentary elections set April. Erez took efforts form government last week veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable convince Turkey's bickering center-left and center-right parties join him coalition that excluded Islamic-oriented party. Erez opened talks various party leaders Monday. He got support center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said his party supported Erez long he had Ecevit's backing. As long our sensitivity secular, democratic regime is taken account, we will do our best help form new government and ensure it gets vote confidence, Ecevit said his talks Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military is opposed any deal that would bring Virtue power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, Welfare Party, out power last year. Erez is supposed talk Tuesday center-right Tansu Ciller and Deniz Baykal, who leads center-left party. I am more and more optimistic every meeting, Erez told reporters meeting party leaders. Turkey has been trying form new government coalition government led Yilmaz collapsed last month allegations that he rigged sale bank. Yilmaz is now acting premier. A week Turkish government fell corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel Wednesday asked veteran left-wing politician known his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, form new government. Ecevit, who served prime minister three times 1970s, said he would immediately begin working fashion government that could command majority faction-ridden Parliament. He also suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 date new election, he might seek remain power longer period. It is wrong see this government simply election government, he said. There are problems that will not wait election. Military commanders, who hold ultimate power Turkey, have quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that they do not want quick election. They fear it will produce Parliament just divided present one, perhaps Islamic-oriented Virtue Party largest bloc. The commanders are also hoping exclude two country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither whom they trust, posts new government. Ecevit must now try build government that includes their center-right parties not them individuals. In meeting this week country's senior policy-making body, National Security Council, which military officers have strong say, set three priorities coming months. It said that government emerges forthcoming negotiations should dedicate itself fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish nationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrated state apparatus. Among Ecevit's immediate challenges will be resolve political crisis Italy that broke out last month when Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested Rome and then asked political asylum there. Turkey wants Ocalan sent here trial, Italy says it cannot extradite him long Turkey retains death penalty. Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) is few senior Turkish politicians who favors abolition capital punishment. Together Demirel, Ecevit is cited Turks who complain continued dominance geriatric political elite here. He is 73 and has been politics most his adult life. Early his career Ecevit emerged spokesman Turkey's downtrodden masses. Perhaps more any other figure, he legitimized social democratic ideology climate where leftist sympathies were considered subversive. At same time, however, he has shown himself be fierce nationalist. He was prime minister when Turkey sent troops occupy northern Cyprus 1974 and is still considered hard-liner Cyprus. He is also uncompromising his opposition Kurdish nationalism. During his terms prime minister 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined efforts move Turkey membership European Union, then called European Economic Community. He considered it instrument capitalist exploitation. Ecevit has also disturbed United States flirting anti-Western ideologies. In early 1990s, interval when he worked journalist, he traveled Iraq and wrote series articles favorable Saddam Hussein. He recently called better relations Turkey and Iraq, and maintains some anti-imperialist positions and suspicion capitalism that he developed 1960s. The Democratic Socialist Party, which Ecevit heads, is closely held family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully screen applicants membership and veto those whose personal loyalty Ecevit is suspect. During his terms prime minister '70s, Ecevit not appear be consensus builder, said Ilter Turan, professor political science Bilgi University Istanbul. It seems that nowadays he is more accommodating, so that perspective he may not be bad choice. On many issues that Turkish society is encountering now, he represents orientation which does not seem be totally tune times, Turan said. That would include his position issues privatization, integrating Turkey more fully international system, and devolution central authority. He has failed grasp where world is heading. He looks and analyzes world categories that are no longer useful or appropriate. Almost alone Turkish politicians, Ecevit lives modestly and has avoided any hint personal or financial scandal. He speaks fluent English, and his reading tastes run poetry and intellectual journals such The New York Review Books. He has translated works T.S. Eliot Turkish and published several volumes his poems. Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz allegations he interfered privatization bank and helped businessman linked mobster. Yilmaz' minority government could go if the small, center-left Republican Party, which gives him majority he needs parliament, votes him. The leader Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz resign. But premier vowed Wednesday stay on, saying he was victim conspiracy. This is plot and it can't be reason resignation, Yilmaz said, adding that he intended continue struggle organized crime. Afterward, Baykal said Republicans would support no-confidence motion. The leader Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, said his party might withdraw governing coalition. He said party would announce its decision Thursday. The political turmoil sent Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist difficult task convincing key party leader join forces secular coalition. Ecevit, who was asked form new government Wednesday, desperately needs support 99 deputies ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, veteran leftist, already has support another center-right party led Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapsed last week weight mafia scandal. Mrs. Ciller has not said if she would back Ecevit-led government and her long-standing rivalry Yilmaz makes Ecevit's job coalition-building difficult. I don't give that easily, neither do I lose hope that easily, Ecevit told his parliamentary group Thursday. Mrs. Ciller could lose grassroot support if she stands way new government, political columnist Ertugrul Ozkok wrote Thursday daily Hurriyet. This could put her odds her classic support base. Ecevit was expected meet Yilmaz Thursday, and other party leaders Friday. Turkey's secular parties are pressure join forces keep Islamic Virtue Party out power. Virtue is largest party Parliament, all-powerful military is fiercely opposed Islamic-led government. President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely turn some widely trusted lawmaker form Turkey's next government, veteran politician abandoned efforts Monday persuade bickering political leaders support him pro-secular coalition. Bulent Ecevit Democratic Left Party failed 3-week-old attempt form government that could command majority votes Parliament. It is now clear that no party leader can form government that can win vote confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said talks Demirel. We have told president that we will not hamper appointment deputy Parliament. With party leaders unable overcome differences, new premier-designate would most probably be affiliated party be trusted enough other parties follow independent line. Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin has been suggested likely candidate. The new appointment would be made days, Yilmaz told reporters. Demirel consulted Turkey's party leaders immediately Ecevit gave up. Most declared themselves favor government led lawmaker. Only center-right leader Tansu Ciller said she wanted government led party leader, and made clear she was willing take task. Turkey's parliament is split longstanding animosity its center-left and center-right parties. Yilmaz led last government, which collapsed November allegations he had ties organized crime and interfered sale state bank. By tradition, Demirel should then have asked leader Parliament's largest party form new government. But Demirel broke custom keep Islamic-oriented Virtue Party power.

Federal authorities investigating murder Buffalo-area obstetrician who performed abortions have identified Vermont man material witness sniper attack last month and issued warrant his arrest Wednesday bring him questioning. The man was identified James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address was St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are not known, investigators said. Investigators said Kopp's car was seen Amherst, N.Y., home Dr. Barnett Slepian weeks doctor, whose work abortion clinic had long made him target harassment, was killed. Kopp, according police records and abortion rights groups, has moved country series protests abortion clinics, and has been linked underground manual that describes methods killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions. Denise O'Donnell, U.S. attorney western district New York, said Kopp was not considered suspect this time was believed have information material case. She declined give details what evidence was being sought Kopp, describing it only information that is contained sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise ongoing investigation. Ms. O'Donnell said that federal law allowed arrest warrant material witness when person has information that is important case. If Kopp is found, he would be arrested, brought Buffalo and ordered provide required evidence, Ms. O'Donnell said. Then, most likely, individual would be released. Slepian, 52, was shot sniper firing his home Oct. 23, shortly returning evening service his synagogue. He was standing his kitchen his wife and one his four sons when bullet crashed back window. He died two hours later. Law enforcement officials said Wednesday's announcement material witness warrant was part attempt underscore potential danger anti-abortion violence advance Remembrance Day, Canadian holiday that falls Nov. 11 and that authorities have associated some anti-abortion crimes. At same time, Justice Department and FBI were trying find ways step federal response violence abortion clinics aftermath Slepian killing. The officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno would soon announce that Justice Department, aiming heighten visibility federal role cases that cross state and local jurisdictional boundaries, would revive national investigative effort focused abortion clinic violence. Ms. Reno and senior FBI officials, including Robert Bryant, deputy FBI director, have met physician and abortion rights groups recent days discuss ways enhance federal investigative efforts and coordination local agencies. Federal authorities first organized abortion clinic task force 1995 killing Florida doctor. The unit, which was charged investigating whether national conspiracy existed, spent nearly two years studying abortion clinic violence. The unit disbanded uncovering national conspiracy. Law enforcement officials said that unit's operation help reduce violence abortion clinics and that, part, decision re-establish it was prompted Ms. Reno's desire send renewed message anti-abortion extremists that government would aggressively investigate these crimes. Slepian's murder fit pattern four earlier sniper attacks abortion doctors Canada and western New York, dating 1994. None attacks have been solved. Bernard Tolbert, special agent charge FBI Buffalo, said news conference here Wednesday that investigators had not determined whether there is link five killings. There's possibility they could be linked, certainly no information, he said. Tolbert gave little information subject material-witness warrant, say that Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier, Vermont license plate BPE216, was seen Slepian's home beginning several weeks murder. We don't have any idea where he is, Tolbert said Kopp. We are looking him every place we can, every place he might be. A photograph Kopp taken January 1997 has been distributed law enforcement agencies United States and Canada. The National Abortion Federation has sent out advisory clinics country search Kopp, said Melinda DuBois, assistant director Womenservices, clinic where Slepian worked. She said naming Kopp material witness case had not brought relief nurses and other workers clinic. I don't think it makes me or anyone else clinic feel differently, she said. I don't want anybody relax and say, `Oh God, they got guy.' That's easy happen. I still want people be very vigilant. The clinic is last Buffalo area that is performing abortions. Slepian was one only handful doctors Buffalo who were still willing perform procedure face pickets, protesters and threats. Since his death, doctors Buffalo have come clinic continue providing abortion services. Rosina Lotempio was standing abortion clinics here Operation Rescue stormed town 1992 rowdy Spring Life rallies, which hundreds were arrested. She was there Lambs Christ demonstrators came town 1993. She was sidewalk Buffalo GYN Womenservices morning Oct. 23, 12 hours Barnett Slepian, clinic doctor, was fatally shot his home. And she was there Friday, brown rosary beads her hands, small gold cross chain her neck, quietly praying abortions stop. I'm heartbroken when I have come here, Mrs. Lotempio, 58, said she stood cold, wearing small black earmuffs and white turtleneck adorned tiny silver pin baby feet. It's very difficult out here; I depend God, she said, praying several moments decide whether talk reporter. The bombings, fiery rhetoric abortion opponents and posters bloody fetuses may capture attention news media, people Mrs. Lotempio are foot soldiers abortion battle. They call themselves street counselors and come clinic whenever they believe abortions are being performed. They pray and they talk women, hoping change their minds. Some scream profanities. Others, Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only violence doctors and clinics, also blocking doors and shouting ugly epithets clinic workers and patients. For approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest is more job political activity. There is schedule. People count them show up. Mrs. Lotempio, mother three and grandmother six, connects her involvement conversation 1970s which she helped friend decide abort unwanted pregnancy. Two decades later, she was haunted her question: whether fetus was male or female. I just felt horrible and I felt guilty, she said, tears her eyes. I thought that if I was clinic doing something, I could make that baby's life. During Mrs. Lotempio's 8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift Friday, dozen people circled area front Buffalo clinic, saying Hail Mary. Others take her spot Tuesdays and Wednesdays. She returns Saturdays, when 40 people crowd sidewalk. Similar bands protesters march front abortion clinics throughout United States, and local protesters are joined bands people who roam country. At clinic Main Street, north downtown Buffalo, there is odd sense community. Local protesters greet Dick, security guard, name. They sometimes see enemy  abortion-rights volunteers who escort patients and out clinic  supermarket or soccer field. Robert Behn, one protest leaders, spent two hours talking abortion breakfast last year Slepian. And several said they cried when they heard Slepian's death. Most protesters, including Mrs. Lotempio, were thousands people arrested here 1992, height anti-abortion activity Buffalo. But if Operation Rescue returns, planned, Spring Life reunion April, Mrs. Lotempio said, she will not be there. Instead, she plans stay church and pray, avoid militancy she says she finds uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, lawyer Womenservices clinic, said: When people out town show up, that is when we feel most danger. The local people are known quantity. We know most local people name. Buffalo has been handful hot spots abortion protesters last decade. It is heavily Catholic city where thousands protesters country demonstrated two weeks 1992. They failed close abortion clinics, 500 people were arrested rallies that snarled traffic and drew national headlines. Those rallies, well earlier protests and continuing sidewalk vigils, have had impact, people sides abortion issue say. The number clinics performing abortions Buffalo area has dropped one three. And Slepian's death and retirement this week another doctor, there are only two doctors area whom abortions form significant part their practices. The daily demonstrators count this progress. But their perch clinic means they witness far more what they believe are murders what they call rescues. About 30 women day might go clinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio can count eight women who changed their minds and not get abortions while she was clinic. Inside clinic, protests just make hard job harder, many clinic workers say. While some demonstrators simply repeat rosary, other protesters call out patients they drive parking lot building, or walk fortresslike front. They ask questions Do you know what your baby looks like? or Is it boy or girl? Sometimes they accuse people murder and torture and sin, or threaten them damnation. Federal law bars protesters coming 15 feet clinic entrances, and leaning signs its walls. Some push limits, frustrating clinic workers and guards. The rules protect people physical harassment, because distance, they turn what could be quiet conversations catcalls and taunts. When patient goes clinic, protesters take different persona, said Melinda DuBois, director Buffalo clinic. They scream and yell and call us names. They lie. Some days we're immune it, other days it's just too much. Linda Palm, 51, marching clinic Friday, said she identified clinic patients. When she was 23, she said, she struggled difficulties being unmarried and pregnant herself, decided have her child, and married father. She began protesting 1990, attending abortion protest march Albany. While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day has become chilling vigil Canadians front lines abortion-rights movement. There is immediate fear, because anti-abortion gunman is believed be large. And there is long-term anxiety, because this country where abortions are legal and publicly funded, women may find access diminishing. There is speculation sniper's timing is linked Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use day commemorate aborted fetuses. Three times 1994, sniper has used this time year fire home Canadian doctor who performs abortion, each time wounding target. The attacks were spread Canada  Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. U.S. and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked two shootings abortion-providing doctors upstate New York, including Oct. 23 slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian his home Buffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted questioning shootings. Police say they don't know which side border he is on, fueling uneasiness clinics and hospitals throughout Canada. You must realize Canada has largest undefended border world, said Keith McCaskill, police inspector Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman investigation. Many women's clinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions have been urged take precautions. I would suggest they be extremely aware their day-to-day goings on, whether their business day or hours, said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, there have been reports obstetrician-gynecologists modifying their practices or deciding stop performing abortions. Some wear bulletproof vests and hang sheets windows their homes. Abortion-rights groups say most doctors are not backing down. There's great deal sadness, said Susan Fox, director clinic Edmonton, Alberta, that provides abortions. But there's also feeling determination that we won't be deterred or scared these actions. Marilyn Wilson, executive director Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, sees long-term threat because fear violence may intimidate young doctors entering field. There are almost no doctors who have stopped performing these procedures, current reign terror, she said. But young doctors families wouldn't necessarily want do this. They may not be willing put their lives risk. The abortion debate is only one several factors contributing shortage obstetrician-gynecologists Canada. The national society that oversees speciality says there are 1,400 doctors field, shortfall 600, and most are their 50s or 60s. The society says long hours and limits fees paid public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical school graduates they choose specialty. Another problem is that few Canadian medical schools offer training abortion. Women Canada's big cities generally have adequate access abortions. Those rural areas face long journeys, and province Prince Edward Island prohibits abortions its six hospitals, forcing women there travel New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups say situation would improve if RU-486 abortion pill were available Canada. No drug company has applied permission market pill, either fearing boycotts or doubting its profitability. The government has been urged make public appeal drug companies, health department says this can't be done. It would be conflict interest, said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, department spokeswoman. As regulator we have stay arm's length, so we can judge application impartially. Abortion was illegal Canada 1988. Now there is no abortion law any sort, 100,000 abortions are performed annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support doesn't spare doctors fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led efforts overturn old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic was bombed 1993, says he and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom they reluctantly increase security measures. Unfortunately, doctors who are committed providing these services will have accept certain diminishment their enjoyment life, he said. In aftermath last month's deadly sniper attack obstetrician upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week that she was setting new investigative unit examine possibility that doctor was victim broader anti-abortion plot. The unit, National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include dozen Justice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies. But main work looking shooting Dr. Barnett Slepian his suburban Buffalo home and how it fits larger pattern organized violence will be done FBI, which has jurisdiction domestic terrorism. For many FBI, that's problem. In contrast old image gung-ho FBI agents turning their surveillance machinery political groups, number senior FBI agents privately expressed misgivings attorney general's latest task force, second she has ordered begin broad investigation conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear that expanding investigation could drive agency ill-defined boundary that separates inquiries criminal activity those political causes and unpopular ideas. Today's agents are eager disassociate themselves old J. Edgar Hoover days trampling civil rights political dissidents guise serious investigations. They do not want agency drawn middle bitter ideological war anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who have long asserted existence organized campaign clinics and doctors. Many those calling government help were once themselves subjects FBI interest anti-war and civil rights activists. Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, were starting their careers early 1970s and watched dismay FBI was shaken revelations Cointelpro, counterintelligence program that allowed agents spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil rights groups Students Democratic Society and Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials are dubious that conspiracy exists kill doctors who perform abortions. They came empty handed when Reno ordered first federal inquiry 1994 killing Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursued some anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. But investigators never found specific plot abortion clinics and staff members. Violence abortion clinics is only part problem. The FBI has recent years found itself thrown minefield politically tinged cases involving volatile worlds anti-government militias, environmental and Christian extremists, white separatists, animal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists. The FBI is very quick jump investigating crime investigating political association, said David Cole, law professor Georgetown University. When you move investigating crimes investigating groups, that all-important nexus criminal conduct gets lost, focus gets broader and broader and you start sweeping all kinds lawful political activity. In response terrorist attacks bombings World Trade Center 1993, Oklahoma City federal building 1995 and Olympic park Atlanta 1996, agency has increased efforts deter such incidents major prevention program. In such cases, Justice Department, FBI and other law enforcement agencies said they operate domestic security guidelines that require investigators find reasonable indication that group is planning break law they can open inquiry organization. Before authorities can use such intrusive tactics wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence. Yet FBI agents throughout country have quietly evaluated threat posed variety extremist groups its links local authorities and informal interviews leaders some groups. Their conclusion is that most these groups pose little real danger. Much more difficult investigate are lone terrorists inflamed oratory extremist ideology who belong no group, drifting society's frayed margins, grid, some agents describe it, usual ties family, friends or work. The profile fits Eric Robert Rudolph, fugitive wanted bombings Atlanta Olympics, gay nightclub and two abortion clinics. He has kept his beliefs mostly himself, although acquaintances hint that he was familiar religious extremism and hate groups. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who is being sought material witness killing Slepian, left trail clues his motives. He was early follower Randall Terry, leader Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp was associated Lambs Christ, another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said that government should do what it does best. We should investigate violations, he said. We shouldn't investigate groups. Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that slight, graying physician endured measure stress that would exhaust, break, most people. There were strangers who pawed garbage cans his home and growled murderer they passed him grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients they arrived his office their checkups, calling him baby killer. Outside clinic where he performed abortions two days week, pickets shouted epithets pig his face. Slepian, obstetrician and gynecologist training and abortion doctor principle, rarely acknowledged strain. He might crack occasional joke expense protesters who shadowed him work and weekends. Then he would do something unexpected, invite anti-abortion leader breakfast or stop and chat familiar demonstrator clinic. So when he was killed Oct. 23 sniper's bullet fired kitchen window his home Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, furtive execution that fit pattern four earlier attacks abortion providers western New York state and Canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. He had predicted much himself. Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted that work, long other Buffalo doctors had surrendered pressure abortion opponents. He was incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is nothing you can do it, said H. Amanda Robb, doctor's 32-year-old niece. And he was incredibly stubborn. He said that women had right comprehensive health care and he was women's doctor, he was going provide it them. Slepian is third doctor be killed last five years bombings and shootings that have killed 7 people and wounded 17 abortion clinics nation. To his tormentors, he was simply abortion doctor. To members abortion rights movement, he was martyr their cause. But Slepian was far either. In interviews friends and family members, he emerges more one-dimensional abstract  conservative who advocated old-fashioned values self-reliance, shy man who had rare flashes anger, doctor who performed abortions had no more patience women who had multiple abortions women who had multiple children they not want or could not support. He was killed because he performed medical procedure that has become emotional and politicized. Yet there is nothing his life suggest he was crusader either politics or medicine. Rather, he was obstinate, unassuming man who remarkable thing. Out contrariness and out conscience, say those who knew him, he refused allow anyone dictate what kind doctor he should be, and that, he paid his life. The clues Slepian's flinty brand commitment lie, part, his upbringing. His was family that took success granted it teetered edge poverty. To earn money medical school, he shoveled muck ranch and drove taxi. He made few friends, those he had were friends life. When their wives were sick, he called repeatedly. When they were lonely, he flew their side. Slepian, who was known Bart, used tell people that he chose obstetrics because it is specialty that exposes doctor least suffering, and that he performed abortions because it was legal and alternatives were so much worse. Slepian expressed exasperation women who came him abortion abortion. Don't they get it? his clinic staff recall him saying more once. He had same impatience women those he remembered his residency inner-city Buffalo, who had child child and no means support. He had contempt that somebody who had pulled himself his bootstraps and made it world, Ms. Robb said. He believed that ban abortions or, just shameful his view, stop teaching young doctors how perform them, would not correct human imperfections that he found so irritating. There are 1.5 million abortions performed this country, his niece said, and he just felt we're not equipped handle 1.5 million unwanted children. When he was killed, age 52, Bart Slepian owned imposing red brick home quiet suburb Amherst, complete swimming pool piped-in music and assortment time-saving gadgets he adored. Slepian's trajectory that comfortable doctor's life had been unconventional. His grandfather, Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling shoelaces pushcart Boston, propelled all five his sons Harvard time when few Jews met university's blue-blood standards. His father, turn, decreed that his three sons would be doctors or earn Ph.D's. We grew home where there was tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect education, said Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, who is four years older him. If you got A, it was OK If you got B, you got yelled at. The family's means not match its expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, had joined his father's business manufacturing leather soles shoes. Soon Bart was born 1946 Boston, company failed, so money, father moved his family six his in-laws' apartment McKeesport, Pa., and then Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, Slepian's father set himself freelance writer, crisscrossing country his old Studebaker, researching origins prominent citizens Library Congress and writing their stories small-town newspapers. He sold articles hundreds, and was still writing his death nine years ago age 93. The success that was expected Bart Slepian not come easily. As child, he was so shy that he cried when anyone looked him, his sister recalled. An unexceptional student, he went local community college transferring University Denver, where he majored zoology. Rejected medical schools United States  fate two out three applicants late 1960s  he studied one year Belgium and then enrolled Autonomous University Medicine Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember him funny and obstinate, thin young man glasses and receding hairline who beat all comers arm-wrestling and pool. Bart had certain beliefs, strongly held, said Richard Schwarz, old classmate who is internist Long Island. He always said you shouldn't sit whining things, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go what's yours and what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced quirky ways. He once insisted going top World Trade Center, crippling fear heights. To get window, he crawled, inch inch. I said, `You don't have do this,'  recalled Schwarz, who was him time. And he said, `I want do it.' Bart made it count. He felt alive. Forced drop out school every few semesters work, he lived Reno his sister Serena, widow who was struggling take care two young daughters. She worked waitress and blackjack dealer, sharing her tips him while he drove cab, cleaned barns ranch and worked laboratory assistant local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, he moved Buffalo his medical residency. There he married Lynne Breitbart, registered nurse 10 years his junior, and scraped together money buy obstetrics practice doctor who was retire. He had soothing, unhurried manner. When patient his, Patti Durlak, was diagnosed diabetes, Slepian referred her specialist called every few days months help her overcome fear needles she had use her insulin injections. The other doctor said, `Just deal it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. Not Dr. Slepian. In most ways, he was typical suburban family man, working six days week and spending his free time Little League games and county fairs his four sons. But late 1980s, he and other abortion doctors Buffalo were siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded videotape, Rev. Paul Schenck, one fieriest Buffalo's anti-abortion leaders, threw himself front doctor's car he pulled clinic driveway. Slepian parked street. As he pushed his way crowd chanting demonstrators, Schenck cupped his hands his mouth and lunged, shouting, Slepian, you pig! Slepian's attempts separate abortion conflict his private life were futile. The protests followed him home and man who had been so bashful boy found himself, uncomfortably, center controversy and attention. Once, he showed his anger. In 1988, when demonstrators jeered him sidewalk front his home he opened Hanukkah presents his children, doctor came out brandishing baseball bat. He denied he hurt anyone, town judge ordered him repair one protester's smashed van window and pay portion another's medical bills. The outburst surprised his family and friends. It was not Slepian's style make public fuss, much less acknowledge stress being taunted protesters. Stress? his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked doctor's mood. I never heard word used my family, engineering term. He said it was nuisance. Mrs. Slepian not respond requests interview. She expressed rage The Buffalo News shortly shooting. She said that whoever had killed her husband deserved death penalty and that she would be happy administer lethal injection herself. She also spoke out Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader who frequently confronted Slepian, sent bouquet flowers. Mrs. Slepian denounced him hypocrite. After confrontation 1988, Slepian turned civil harassment lawsuits, letters and levity deal protesters. In 1993, when man active anti-abortion effort was arrested rifling doctor's garbage cans home, Slepian tried treat incident lightly. They hopefully got bags full dirty diapers, he joked. He tried engage his critics local newspaper. He told The Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies birth control and counseling. In letter editor he warned that repeatedly calling him murderer, his critics were inciting violence. Slepian accepted that opponents abortion acted out moral conviction, his friends said, resented personal attacks. He thought it tended demonize and dehumanize him and increased danger, said his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took step that few nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared. He insisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut venom. To dismay staff members who feared his safety, Slepian began year ago stop and chat protesters he recognized Womenservices abortion clinic Buffalo, where he worked two days week. He surprised gathering protesters who were preparing what they euphemistically called house call, or demonstration doctor's home, and invited protest's organizer, Rev. Robert Behn, breakfast. Their hourlong conversation next morning was inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture attempt get people him. He asked Slepian how performing abortions affected him spiritually. In response, he recalled, doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focused more time away home his family. He planned take cruise next spring. He bought time-share apartment Disney World Florida. He had so many plans, said Ellen Fink, close friend couple 15 years. He wasn't done. He wasn't done living yet. Still, sometimes most casual conversations, shadow would appear. When his wife gave him gray African parrot birthday gift, Slepian joked that bird would probably outlive him so he would teach it his eulogy. He would talk funeral he wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He said he didn't have lot friends and wanted all them come separate cars, one each car, so he'd have long procession. In week his death, Slepian had reasons be preoccupied thoughts mortality. A medical checkup had revealed blockage his heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting conversation Mrs. Slepian day slaying. A blockage is sign probable coronary artery disease. He was have more tests week. I said, `Lynne, just relax, it's going be OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That same day, National Abortion Federation sent fax Womenservices clinic warning pattern sniper attacks abortion doctors that occurred early November. Marilynne Buckham, clinic director, sent it Slepian. He definitely took it seriously, she recalled. Typically, doctor not share any concerns he might have felt. It was normal day, said Tammi Latini, his office assistant. We were horsing around.' That evening, Slepians went synagogue mark ninth anniversary death Slepian's father. Shortly they returned home, sniper's bullet smashed kitchen window, killing Slepian he chatted his wife and sons. The protesters returned clinic five days later, first day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, director, said Slepian would not have been surprised. They have their routine. So he. He never wanted day end bad note, she said. At end day, I would always say, `Thank you coming.' And he would always turn stupid grin and say, `Thanks having me.' The slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian his home last week eliminated mainstay only abortion clinic here, it has not eliminated women's access abortion. That is because availability abortion Buffalo area, much United States, is complex reality, one affected class and education, medical training and personal convictions individual doctors. Knowledgeable middle-class and affluent women here who find themselves unwanted pregnancy can obtain abortion their private gynecologists, or if gynecologist has personal objection procedure, referral colleague. Women who are poor, young or uneducated and have no such regular relationships doctors have rely specialized clinics one Slepian worked in, or hospitals. It is this group  whom unplanned pregnancies are far more common prosperous women  that faces shrinking universe possibilities result fear set Slepian's killing and slayings five other doctors and clinic workers 1993, medical experts said. If you're well and well connected, you can get your abortion, said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director center clinical ethics University Buffalo, which trains doctors Buffalo area's hospitals. For everybody else, it's less and less available. The number abortions United States has been declining steadily first years Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalized abortion 1973, according Alan Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive issues. They now number roughly 1.5 million year, according reports Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according National Right Life Committee, nation's largest anti-abortion group, which calculates its estimate partly Guttmacher figures. The number providers who identify themselves performing abortions part their practice is diminishing well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, last one published, found that number had decreased 18 percent 1982 and 1992, 2,380 2,908. Moreover, study said, only 12 percent nation's residency programs routinely offer training abortions first trimester, though many do offer elective courses. Laura Echevarria, director media relations National Right Life Committee, contends, however, that most teaching hospitals do train gynecologists procedures treating miscarriages that are similar those used performing abortions. Only cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities New York does availability abortions continue steady level, experts say, though these locales there is concern decreasing number young doctors who emerge residencies fully trained performing abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, which keeps nation's most precise statistics, said that 1992, last year which it has figures, there were 142,410 abortions New York that were done just 151 providers, including 61 hospitals and 44 clinics. Still, that provider figure greatly understates number private doctors who perform them their offices, medical experts say. Many obstetricians and gynecologists Manhattan provide abortions part their palette services, and have many years, said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director Planned Parenthood. Rich and middle-class women have always had access abortions, and they always will. The major threat availability city is less result anti-abortion violence medical training. The bottom line is that we're facing impending shortage physicians who are adequately trained and willing do procedures, said Dr. John Choate, chairman New York State division American College Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But lack training programs is also result political pressures hospitals and universities antagonists abortion and same climate fear. Physicians tend lie low, Choate said. They don't publicize fact that they do them. If they do them, they do it quietly out fear their practice and their lives. One development horizon that is expected change outlook abortions substantially is final federal approval, expected next year, RU-486 pill, drug that ends early pregnancy need surgery. When pill was introduced France and Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, number surgical abortions plummeted. In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove night his home Binghamton, N.Y., Atlanta start series anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, America's front pages, James Charles Kopp was van riding alongside him, according former leaders Operation Rescue who spoke condition anonymity. And, those people say, when Terry was arrested first day Operation Rescue's Siege Atlanta, Kopp followed him jail. Along more one hundred other Operation Rescue members, according some people who were there, Kopp remained jail 40 days and adhered Terry's orders not give real name police or courts. After his release, Kopp returned Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, and was there working alongside Terry group's power and influence anti-abortion movement surged late 1988 and 1989, according former leaders Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp is being sought federal and local law enforcement authorities questioning material witness murder obstetrician who performed abortions Buffalo region. The authorities also say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attacks doctors who performed abortions Canada and upstate New York. Some abortion-rights groups are seizing Kopp's role Operation Rescue raise new questions connections recent anti-abortion violence and hard-line anti-abortion protest groups that burst national scene late 1980s. For years, Federal Bureau Investigation and Justice Department have looked vain evidence determine whether national conspiracy might be series clinic bombings and shootings doctors and other clinic staff members that began early 1990s. A federal grand jury Alexandria, Va., that looked conspiracy allegations was ultimately disbanded finding national underground. But some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that Kopp may help provide such link. In fact, announcement that law enforcement officials are looking him has been made Attorney General Janet Reno has prepared revive interagency task force look once again possible conspiracies anti-abortion crimes. Federal law enforcement officials and authorities say Kopp is not now suspect sniper attack Oct. 23 that killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car was seen Slepian's home Amherst, N.Y. weeks doctor was shot. One day issuing warrant Kopp's arrest material witness, law enforcement officials least 10 agencies spanning United States and Canadian border still had not located Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement officials said they were pursuing many tips, including 400 that have poured FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police have gone photographs abortion protesters and clinic workers Buffalo and country, and they are also reviewing hundreds hours videotapes demonstrations search Kopp's face. At this point, officials consider shooting Slepian be connected three attacks Canada and one Rochester doctors who provide abortions. The five attacks, all 1994, occurred weeks leading Nov. 11, Veterans Day  called Remembrance Day Canada  holiday that has become important anti-abortion activists. But attacks were spread four years and 3,000 miles, Vancouver, British Columbia, Buffalo. As is case many early veterans Operation Rescue, Kopp was transformed hard-core anti-abortion militant jail Atlanta 1988, according many people who were jail him who insisted anonymity. By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She and her family live rambling old home shore Lake Ontario, and every morning, she gives her husband, John, peck cheek he goes work. She runs errands, other suburban moms, and spends much her day taking care her children. But one thing sets Mrs. Hayes apart her neighbors. As devoted opponent abortion, 43-year-old mother nine regularly plays host series traveling speakers, priests and protesters  many whom have come Rochester intent spreading word abortion and shutting clinics that provide it. She is one thousands people country loosely associated anti-abortion groups Lambs Christ who have opened their homes Lambs' founder, Rev. Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrators. While many  including Mrs. Hayes  disavow violent tactics, supporters abortion rights say that people her bear some responsibility when protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors. These people who provide Father Weslin food and shelter when he comes town close clinics are not innocent, said Ann Glazier, director clinic defense Planned Parenthood Federation. It's just not credible say they aren't part extremist activity that is taking place these clinics. They are still guilty interfering women's access. But Mary Quinn, local organizer Lambs Christ who also offers her home protesters, sees matters differing light. Taking people this is act Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `People who travel country doing this work are taken those us that who don't want lose their stupid houses. We take these people because they are willing make sacrifice. Members Lambs Christ have been persistent figures protests Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked he was shot death last month. Although no suspect has been identified shooting or several similar attacks New York and Canada several years, officials are looking question Vermont man whose car was seen Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, has participated abortion protests more decade, and was house guest other members Lambs Christ. While Mrs. Hayes says she would never so much obstruct clinic's door, some those whom she has given refuge have no qualms doing so. Weslin, leader Lambs Christ, is one those who has benefited Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, modern version generosity that Christ and Apostles knew well. He prides himself being arrested more 60 times protests front medical clinics. And throughout 1980s and early '90s, he was active clinic rescues, which protesters tried physically restrain patients trying enter clinics. Weslin stayed Mrs. Hayes' home only once, beginning May 1996 when he first came speak local churches anti-abortion movement. But stay that lasted several months, he was arrested Federal charges blocking access Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed. He was later convicted and served two and half months prison. During protest clinic, he and several other protesters locked themselves homemade contraption called oven, made cement and iron. It took police officers several hours lug device horse trailer that carted it off. At same protest, one man glued his head lock gate surrounding clinic, move some protesters later said was accident. Abortion opponents Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak attending peaceful observances abortion clinics and offering prayers unborn. They talk counseling women alternatives abortion Roman Catholic pregnancy centers, and their support anti-abortion candidates. But they also say they saw nothing wrong Weslin trying block access clinics. They describe activity peaceful resistance meant stop what they see murders. Weslin and other house guests Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommended friends and members local Catholic churches, they said, adding that most are speakers local churches or anti-abortion events. And although they say they would never take their homes stranger wanted FBI, Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little their guests. But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know lot Weslin. An Army veteran, he has been leader anti-abortion movement more 25 years, they say, and founded home unwed mothers. Mrs. Hayes said that when she met him, it was obvious he was man peace who had tremendous devotion Blessed Mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lambs. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who developed ties Lambs Weslin came town, added that priest epitomized man God. I just knew when I looked his holy shoes and his simple coat that had been mended 50 times, she said. He was humble, man who was doing this higher purpose, trying people sacrifice and prayer. opp also has robust defenders people who housed him he rode country protest protest. E. Kenny, 20, said that his parents housed Kopp their St. Albans, Vt., home two years he spoke their local church 1988. During Kopp's stay, he was pleasure, Kenny said, always helping house. He was nice guy, kind uncle us, Kenny said. He'd sit and play video games us and make us model planes out wood. Like Weslin, Kopp was consumed need fight abortion and talked its evils, Kenny said, adding that Kopp was gentle man who wanted become Catholic priest. He was always good mood, Kenny said. He never anything violent all. Both Kopp and Weslin have been arrested repeatedly abortion protests. The men have moved same circles and times found themselves arrested same events. Mrs. Quinn said that Weslin told her recent telephone conversation that he knew Kopp. Weslin could not be reached comment, it is clear that two men have encountered each other. Both faced misdemeanor charges blocking Burlington, Vt., health clinic 1990 that Kopp called mill. And they spent time same jail Atlanta 1988 clinic protest. Slepian's death has abortion opponents Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn worried, how killing is being portrayed media and what it will do membership groups Lambs Christ. For long time, you felt voice desert that wasn't being heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And then there was this horrible tragedy this doctor's death becoming face movement. We're saving lives, she said. The FBI has not talked Mrs. Hayes, Kenny said that agents have spoken him. The Justice Department says that Federal task force set this week investigate killing Slepian is looking evidence connecting anti-abortion violence various clinics. It's fair say that when investigating these events, we will look any connection individuals engaged criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, spokesman department, said. Many local Catholics associated Lambs Christ have tried distance themselves killing Slepian. They are mailing literature saying that killer does not represent their movement. In addition, some people associated Lambs are offering other possible explanations killing. Some say they believe that killer might have been someone overcome grief personal experience abortion. Others wondered whether shooter had tried wound doctor scare him or prevent him performing more abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents are being blamed shooting committed disgruntled patient. One idea gaining currency Lambs, and prominently displayed their Web site, suggests that killing was result plot abortion supporters discredit abortion opponents just last week's elections. Mrs. Hayes says she doesn't know truth. There are wackos who travel and they may be front clinic because we are drawn same place, she said. But you don't know everyone who shows and you don't turn person next you and tell them they don't belong there. Mrs. Fredericks said that anyone who would shoot doctor who provides abortions was someone who had snapped, perhaps because importance situation. Members Lambs Christ and other opponents abortion Rochester wonder whether killing Slepian will hinder their efforts. When Weslin first arrived two years ago, he brought new focus group that had done little more counsel pregnant women and set booths college campuses, they said. In many cities, they have priest life coordinating and leading rosary marches abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But Father Weslin coming here, we could finally come together and feel we were doing something sacrificial group. Mrs. Hayes said that she felt first pull movement early 1980s, when she heard women speak choice regard abortion. Then she saw Silent Scream, well-known anti-abortion film that purports show footage abortion. What I saw was end life, she said. She began volunteer Catholic pregnancy center where she encouraged women not kill their child. She also began house unwed mothers and went stand vigil local clinics where abortions were performed. Mrs. Hayes looked her 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, then pointed prenatal image infant, sonogram taken 13 weeks that she keeps her refrigerator door. She described what could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone else's child. Two pounds and two inches ago, she could have been partial-birth abortion, Mrs. Hayes said, referring controversial late-term abortion procedure. They have hardest time getting shoulders out, so they can get head and puncture it. It's brutal, what do you expect when purpose is dead baby? There's no question that these doctors are trying murder child.

Olin said there were indications that fire could have been set. The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not normal fire, he said. Goteborg is 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest capital, Stockholm. The crowd second story building contained mostly 13 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and holiday weekend. A night full expectation, happiness extra leave school and high spirits anticipation weekend was brutally and suddenly changed tragedy incomprehensible dimensions, Goteborg city council said statement. Goteborg is today city shock. Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited fire site midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made statement condolence. Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out dance floor when blaze started 400 people inside. It looked it started ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell floor, he was quoted saying. It was chaos. Everybody was trying get out and people trampled each other way exit. ... Others kicked out windows and jumped out. Ambulances were called several nearby communities. The Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses service help transport injured. Anna-Lisa Saar, social worker Oestra Hospital, where many victims were taken, said identifying many them was difficult. Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ... They maybe don't have their identification, have that friend who is year older. Girls don't carry their identification them, bag and maybe that wasn't lying body, she said, according TT. Goteborg has 435,000 people. Hundreds teen-agers jammed upstairs hall planning dance night away, time sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging life hospitals or weeping disbelief fire that killed 67 them. Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 them severely, explosive fire that engulfed plain brick two-story building just midnight Thursday and turned boisterous disco dance screaming terror matter moments. Bent metal bars some hall's windows showed panic-fueled strength that teen-agers, many them immigrants, exerted they sought ways out hall, which some 400 people was crowded more twice its legal capacity. Below second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and bloody blankets used wrap those who may or may not have lived. I've been crying all day. I haven't been able sleep. I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead, 17-year-old Alina Turk said she stood ruined building Friday afternoon. She said she had been dance and two male friends hers died. Zuhir Hersi, 17-year-old disc jockey bash, told his ordeal telegraphic bursts. Panic. No help. No police. No firemen. Only kids helping each other, he said his bed Goteborg hospital. Although Hersi, many youths dance, believes police and firemen were slow, authorities said first fire trucks were scene five minutes getting alarm. But fire spread so fast that instant response would likely have been too slow. The cause fire had not been determined Friday evening. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said flames' quick, raging spread could indicate arson, or that fire had burned undetected time exploding. The fire destroyed building, whose second floor, where dance took place, was rented local Macedonian immigrant association Sweden's second-largest city. The association had hired out hall night eight party arrangers, police said declined identify arrangers. The crowd was mostly aged 13 18, witnesses said, and consisted mostly immigrants or children immigrant parents. Officials said dead and injured were 19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, well people current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American countries. Identifying dead was wrackingly slow process, forcing relatives and friends exhausted dread wait hours hospitals. Some were able make wait rooms off-limits journalists, many had wait corridors, crying and teen-agers hurry and out rooms they looked their pals. Only 14 bodies had been indentified Friday evening. The identification is hard not only because burns also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents  they were so young, said Kerstin Einarsson Sahlgrenska Hospital, largest city 435,000 some 500 kilometers (300 miles) west Stockholm. The blaze, worst fire disaster Sweden's modern history, shocked country renowned its smooth calmness. King Carl XVI Gustaf, trip out country, sent statement reassuring victims' relatives that all us Sweden feel great sympathy. Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled Stockholm fire site, first laying flowers and walking gutted wreck. The floor was full shoes and boots, same kind boots my children wear, he said. On Friday evening, 1,500 mostly young people, came Goteborg Cathedral try assuage their grief and bewilderment memorial service. The youths were dressed same sort hip-hop garb that dance-goers had worn, listened delicate hymns instead pounding disco. They wept, they embraced, and some looked nervously, apparently not knowing how behave church. I don't go church. I'm Muslim, I don't go prayers, said young man who gave his name only Sami. I'm accompanying my Christian friends. We lost someone. We're mourning  that's all.

1026,"Hours Darryl Strawberry was released Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, he spoke happily being able play his two young children, joked eating small amount chicken and potatoes and sounded relieved be home Fort Lee, N.J., instead hospital. I'm really feeling good, said Strawberry, telephone interview. It's nice be home kids and just kick back. That's all that I'm going do. This feels good. Strawberry, who underwent surgery remove cancer his colon Oct. 3, said he will remain New Jersey another 10 or 12 days returning home Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old outfielder, who lost significant amount weight his 215-pound frame, said he does not have enough strength attend any World Series games and is content watching his teammates play Padres television. My heart is them, said Strawberry, who spoke several Yankees they won American League championship. I'm just going relax home and watch game. I'm looking forward it. I may not be there, it'll feel I am. Paul O'Neill echoed sentiments many Yankees saying, Everything we're going is game. This is his life. Any time we get some good news Darryl it's uplifting. We're all praying him. Since cancerous cells were found one 36 lymph nodes removed his abdomen operation, Strawberry said doctors told him he will need six months chemotherapy treatment once he returns California. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctors told him he will need one treatment least one hour week. I was never scared, said Strawberry. I was more emotional anything. At time it, I had played while this. I wanted keep playing because I knew we were going get World Series. At that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because Yankees had made it World Series he expected. I wanted be there because that's what you play for, said Strawberry. I don't think that I was ever scared. It's something that I wanted deal head on. I talked Eric Davis chemo. He said it's not bad some people say. Although discovery cancer one lymph node proved that cancer had spread, Strawberry remained optimistic his future and said, It didn't worry me. I got all information doctors. One out 36 is good. It wasn't spreading. It didn't run and get crazy cancer can. When Strawberry was released hospital wheelchair Friday, few hundred fans who had congregated chanted, Darryl, Darryl. Strawberry, who struggled not cry, hugged few nurses, thanked everyone supporting him, then rose wheelchair and carefully entered car. Wow, I never thought this day would come, Strawberry said. But it has. Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter World Series who predicted Yankees would throttle Padres five games, Strawberry refused make prediction whether he will soon be getting his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, who is still hopeful returning play 1999, sounded very confident 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 back their caps inspiration. They look really good, said Strawberry. It's not going be easy, I think they're ready. The best thing making it World Series is you know you don't have go anywhere else that. You've made it that point and then you go do best you can do. That's what it's all about. As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series Yankees Game 1 World Series Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he wants do it free mind. Free worrying his extremely uncertain future and undisclosed personal matter that has made this post-season perplexing it has been pleasing. But it is not easy keep mind uncluttered. Williams does not know if he will sign Yankees and return center field next season, because he wants test free agency. There is good chance Yankees will not offer him most lavish contract, so Williams might be forced decide fattest paycheck and new situation baseball city his choice or pretty fat paycheck and familiar situation Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared his client players $10 million-a-year bracket last season, so that price tag has surely escalated Williams won American League batting title .339 average while drilling 26 homers and knocking 97 runs. Williams was asked if he agreed theory that other teams will outbid Yankees. I do not know, said Williams, who has been aloof this post-season, has declined discuss why. And I'm thinking this little more I would to. I would keep my focus series. It is not issue Williams or Yankees wants study Saturday or coming days, because team is four victories away championship. Still, it is issue that hovers Yankees ominously owner George Steinbrenner hovers general manager Brian Cashman. It's tough thing, Cashman said balancing excitement being World Series reality trying re-sign Williams. You know ugliness future is right front you. Although Williams has been adamant not discussing future, he relented slightly Friday. When reporter asked him what reasons would be staying Yankees, Williams' answer included escape clause. Just fact that I've been here my whole career, Williams said. That has lot do it. The relationships that I've come know years, I think it would be very hard, not impossible, start scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think reality game this day and age is things happen. You can't really write things stone that they're going happen. People get traded. People become free agents and go other teams. I have make decision really thinking all people I'm accountable for. When Williams was asked what better situation could player have being center fielder Yankees, winning batting crown and being World Series, 30-year-old was stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny you mention that, because I really haven't thought any that. I think, some point season, I was going sit and think, wow, it wasn't bad year all. While Cashman would not discuss financial matters, another Yankee official said team will not offer Williams much $12 million year  unless Steinbrenner gets generous possible championship. It is more likely that Yanks would offer Williams $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate have speculate something this point, Cashman said. We'll give it our best effort sign him level that we're comfortable with. Hopefully, that will be enough. Then we'll have marriage. If not, we'll have divorce. While Williams has earned right become free agent and pursue contract he wants city he wants, he has interesting choices make. When reporter asked Williams how he would respond someone who suggested that he accept less Yankees remain city where he is popular, where he likes his teammates and manager, and where team has been post-season four straight years, he not hesitate answer. My response that would be it's not time right now start thinking that, Williams said. If I start thinking that, it'll distract me what I need do World Series. Williams then talked how Yankees are end remarkable season and how he not want his situation disrupt that. But, Williams' status uncertain, he was asked if next four seven games would be bittersweet, he could be ending 13-year association Yankees. I don't want talk that, Williams said. I'm going have lot fun out there. I'm going go all out. Then Williams walked away interview. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 17: It is fitting that this most memorable baseball seasons should conclude World Series that opens Saturday night Yankee Stadium, aging still grand cathedral sport. Bedecked bunting and banners, revered ballpark always elevates game its aura history and accomplishment. That makes it perfect venue part championship series that will determine whether 1998 Yankees are one greatest teams modern era, or just talented squad that owned regular season folded World Series. New Yorkers are boisterous, boastful bunch, and patter city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem anyone venturing here San Diego root Padres. The word sidewalks and subways is that Padres don't measure Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting pitchers Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one game's best closers Trevor Hoffman, not mention prolific hitters Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling still dangerous. But how is that match Yankees' World Series starting rotation David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, deepest batting order baseball? Yet truth is that Yankees fans are terrified team will crumple. Baseball fans, Yankee fans, can spend lifetime waiting see home team historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that sanctified status unless it ends its record-setting season winning World Series. The doubts keep creeping up. The team was pitiful plate most playoffs. Tino Martinez, top run producer, has been numbing slump. Bernie Williams, American League batting champ, hit well pennant series Cleveland Indians, has seemed distracted personal matters. Shane Spencer, rookie slugging sensation September, hasn't turned out be new Mr. October. Pettitte has been struggling August. The curious thing this team, which won more games regular season any team American League history, is how quiet and unobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering clubhouse leader, no one who seems belong New York. So when Yankees start drift field, fans tend fear team might simply fade away. Until Indians surged temporarily ahead playoffs, Yankees had faced no serious test resiliency all season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade Broadway. But every mighty cheer stadium Saturday night will lurk fear that when curtain falls season, unheralded and unlegendary team San Diego will be one that is remembered. The last time they were seen field Yankee Stadium, they were inadvertently influencing outcome game that sent Cleveland Indians home and Yankees World Series. That's not say umpires will mess World Series, they have shown they are eminently capable interfering natural progression postseason games. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be World Series; umpires' collective bargaining agreement leagues does not allow umpire work league championship series and World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, though agreement does allow umpire work division series and World Series. The three American League umpires who are six-man World Series crew work first playoffs. One them, Richie Garcia, will be crew chief and plate Saturday night's opener Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, AL president, Friday called Garcia, 24-year veteran, one league's most respected umpires. But Saturday night, Garcia will move right field Sunday night Game 2. Now why does that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right field? Ah yes, last time Garcia worked post-season series Yankee Stadium, he was umpire Game 1 league championship series two years ago when young fan New Jersey  no name, please; he has been over-glorified enough  reached fence and caught Derek Jeter's fly ball just Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared catch it. Garcia ruled no interference, that it was home run, then said oops watching television replay clearly showing interference. Too late. The call helped Yankees win first game and set tone series. Even though he made mistake, you know you have best out there, baseball official, speaking condition anonymity, said. That knowledge comes small consolation Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged that umpires, players and managers, aren't perfect. Major league umpires are skilled what they do, they are human, he said telephone interview. Day and day out they do very good job Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have been difficult, that happens time time. The umpires were so human American League playoffs that it happened time time time time. The Cleveland Indians suffered brunt fallibility umpires. We had highlight reel umpires getting knocked baseballs, general manager John Hart said Indians' final game Yankees. The umpires didn't lose game us, we had our share controversies two playoff series umpires. In division series Boston, Brinkman, plate umpire, was so bad his calls pitches and plays plate that he immediately provoked disputes that led his ejecting Mike Hargrove, Indians' manager, three pitches Game 2, and Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry was right or wrong, depending one's point view, his noncall interference Travis Fryman 12th inning Game 2 ALCS. That ruling went favor Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter was stealing second fifth inning when on-target throw Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jumped try get out way instead kicked ball right field. A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry Game 6. But worst call Game 6 was Hendry's force play second base. Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that Vizquel's foot came base he caught ball. Members Yankees indicated Friday that they, too, thought call was wrong. I don't know, Williams said when asked what he thought, I'll take it. It was big play. But he think he was out? I'd rather not comment that, he said. It will stir lot controversy. I don't want get that. When player believes he was safe, he says so and doesn't worry any subsequent controversy. If Williams was implying that he thought he was out, another member Yankees said he had no doubt that Williams was out. I wasn't sure first, this uniformed member team said, when I saw it was Hendry, I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't come bag. Then I saw replay. He was out. The game today is faster it used be, this observer said. The umpires have be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida American League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck National League, will be sharp 18th century French guillotine these four seven games. Leonard Coleman, NL president, said he thought his umpires were first-rate division and league series and added that he has three splendid umpires working World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew is proven and first-rate. We have total confidence them. The umpires should let players make errors and managers bad decisions. Then everyone will talk players and managers and not umpires. A strong sign that this city is going bonkers Padres came Friday morning when 680 fans agreed shave their heads radio promotion raffle return 1-in-680 chance skybox tickets post-season play. This was more show support team it was one ticket, said Tommy Sablan, producer Jeff and Jer show. It was symbolic efforts bald Padres  Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About thousand people showed  men, women and children. We had 10 barbers and 20 hairdressers and it took six hours lines either get buzzed or straight-razored. We were shocked turnout. But this is bandwagon town. `Buy ticket day concert' type public. You'll see bigger bandwagon Monday when they've won and then hopefully we play Yankees and it's real World Series. After Padres beat Braves, 3-0, Game 2 National League Championship Series Thursday night Atlanta take two-game lead four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing shot World Series more traditional ways. It would be team's first World Series appearance 1984, and downtown business district Friday, marquees and banners read Go Padres and lunch-hour rally was attended several hundred fans. The Padres set attendance record 2,555,901 this season, half-million last year and nearly million and half three years ago. It stemmed part effort John Moores, Padres owner, and Larry Lucchino, team's president, put family entertainment park they bought team December 1994. This is more diversified group fans I saw Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud our three generations families who come games. Donna McMahon, 63-year-old homemaker La Jolla, has been fan she was 10 and Pacific Coast League Padres played Lane Field harbor. She would take streetcar school meet her father, and he would buy bleacher seats. Later, she brought her four children Jack Murphy Stadium National League Padres when 2,500 people was crowd. Now, she brings her grandchildren sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There are different groups stands, she said, upper class, middle class, business person, beer-drinking fan, children, all Mexican fans border. We are true fans  all us. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while also giving credit balmy weather. Padre fans are cross-section all county, she said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, ranchers and farmers high-tech engineers, yuppies new kids  X generation. A lot border. The Padres are extremely popular Tijuana. We do have perfect weather long baseball season. Playing World Series October has got be better New York. Carlos Carrion, who was born San Diego and has been baseball fan 25 years, brings his 10- and 8-year-old sons stadium. This is great chance let my children see players work, Carrion said. They can look these guys and understand their character and their work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimates that average, more 15,000 fans 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans San Diego, Baja California or state Sonora. The Padres have first major league baseball souvenir store Tijuana. A new shipment bats arrived Tino Martinez Friday, and he massaged handles make sure they were thin enough, knocked barrels and listened certain sound and swung them slowly again and again. Martinez was so excited fresh bats, he reacted Little Leaguer who was wielding aluminum bat first time. You were saving World Series trees now, right? Martinez said representative bat company. These are World Series trees, aren't they? Martinez could joke bats being specially designed World Series because Yankees began their quest second title three years when they play host San Diego Padres Game 1 Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players who were watching television could not imitate David Letterman and joke World Series wood. Even though Martinez has struggled numerous bats post-season, he could joke because Yankees are still alive title. Martinez is still alive. For now, Martinez, power hitter who has mostly been missing action, could joke around. For now. You always get fresh start post-season because it's game game, said Martinez. If you win, you've got another game next day so you forget bad at-bats. It's easier do that post-season because your next at-bat could be biggest at-bat season. Normally, having Martinez plate biggest at-bat season would be pleasing sight Yankees. But not when calendar flips October. Martinez has experienced another frustrating post-season. He is 5 30 10 strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted hitting-starved team that has batted .229 while still winning 7 9 post-season games because superior pitching. Can Yankees continue win if Martinez, their most valuable run producer, is sometime singles hitter? We've just gotten two good series, said Paul O'Neill. The Yankees won those series. You don't focus one guy. You focus winning. The whole team won. As much Joe Torre talked Martinez needing one line-drive hit get him groove, 30-year-old first baseman is career drought post-season. Since joining Yankees, Martinez is 20 107 (.187) one homer and 4 RBI 29 post-season games. Those are puny statistics, especially player who has driven 381 runs 455 regular season games last three years. I would guess that Tino would have great series, O'Neill said. Baseball has way evening things out. You have bad series, you come back and have great series. In season, that's easier do. In post-season, it gets tougher. It cannot get much tougher Martinez, who was dropped fifth sixth order American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians and will remain that spot further notice. Martinez has blamed his paucity production impatience and trying do too much. He has sometimes flailed poor pitches hitter's counts 3-1 and 2-0, instead working count, and he has admitted that his previous failures post-season have caused him pursue obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez has already made some alterations, and he has reached base 7 times his last 10 plates appearances double, single, hit-by-pitch and 4 walks. It is not enough pacify George Steinbrenner, it is something him cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez had face Kevin Brown, nasty right-hander who had retired him 30 34 career at-bats. If I was getting good pitches and missing them, then I'd say I have bad swing working, said Martinez. But I've been swinging bad pitches. Right now, I've just got be patient and wait. The Yankees will wait him. They have to. In 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder Martinez first Games 3, 4 and 5. It was difficult decision because Martinez had paced team RBI while Fielder not join Yankees July 31. But Yankees grabbed all three games so it worked. Torre does not have such attractive replacement this season Luis Sojo. So Yankees will stay Martinez, better or worse, while he tries stay positive and finally produce. It's World Series, said Martinez. You got go out there and have fun it. Big games are all big games. You want go out there and enjoy that game and try do your best win that game. You don't think that you might lose that day. Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were popular squeegee men week ago, speculation rampant that one or other or might be exiled if Yankees' historic year crumbled post-season. Two big hits midst big inning changed all that Saturday night Game 1 World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, seventh inning, Knoblauch hit three-run home run tie score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed Yankees 9-6 victory opener four-of-seven-game series, 56,712 Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch Andy Ashby Game 2 Sunday night Stadium. Beyond seizing advantage series, Yankees were able neutralize Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, driving him mound seventh. Brown, seen many San Diego's best hope World Series upset, will not pitch again Game 4, earliest. Brown was pitching three-run lead top fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn banged back-to-back homers. One out seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit single, and Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, who had thrown whopping 64 pitches first three innings, went out, and reliever Donne Wall came face Knoblauch. This is what Yankees have done all season, force starter game middle innings, exploiting middle reliever. Knoblauch, course, had earned notoriety his gaffe Game 2 American League Championship Series Cleveland, standing and waiting interference call ball rolled stop him and decisive run scored. The Yankees came back win series, however; Knoblauch got reprieve and talked how much experience had helped him. Facing Wall one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch had duck runaway fastball. Two balls, no strikes. Wall had throw strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lifted high fly left-field line. Off bat, it not look much. But it kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back left and looking up, see ball disappear stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch rounded bases, crossed home plate and thrust arms air, yelling crowd, hyped Olympic weightlifter who had just successfully hoisted half-ton. He stomped dugout, his helmet on, teammates banging him happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left game, and Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and Jeter advanced wild pitch, Bernie Williams was intentionally walked. Chili Davis drew walk. Bases loaded, once more, Martinez coming plate, exactly one run batted in his first 76 career at-bats league championship and World Series games. With count two balls and two strikes, Langston threw pitch corner that he thought should have been strike. Instead, Garcia called it ball. Langston glared, snapping return throw. Langston and Martinez and everyone field now understood that bases loaded and 3-2 count, Langston would have throw what players refer cookie  tasty pitch middle. Martinez ate this cookie. The ball soared upper deck right field, lifting three years post-season misery back Yankees' first baseman, grand slam. The crowd called out Martinez dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped arms, and later crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San Diego's lead was long gone. The Yankees had taken 2-0 lead Brown second inning, forcing him throw 32 pitches second. They loaded bases single and two walks, and Ledee, rookie left fielder who is playing because none Torre's left fielders have been hitting, pulled sinking fastball right field line two outs. The fans foul line stood, some waving push ball fair body English, and ball landed line, skipping wall two runners scored. The Yankees had early edge, they had jumped Brown, and they had their best pitcher mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led second inning blooper shortstop, ball falling single. Quilvio Veras flied right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn plate. David Wells got ahead count, no balls and two strikes, change-up and fastball, trying run fastball Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs regular season. Vaughn attacked pitch: line drive that landed second deck, foul all way, frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, Yankees' catcher, jogged mound re-think strategy, perhaps remind Wells conventional wisdom: you must pitch Vaughn outer edge plate. Posada returned plate, called fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing was short and quick, ball making click sound bat, well-struck golf ball, carrying wall right-center field. Tie game. Wells retired first two batters fifth inning, jamming Veras fastball. Veras' bat snapped contact, it was enough send looper short center field, single. Gwynn stepped in, having hit single his first two at-bats, and looked sign third base coach Tim Flannery. With runner first, he likes try pull ball right side infield. Wells fired fastball, Gwynn turned pitch and ripped it, line drive that crashed facing upper deck right field. The Padres jumped dugout, celebrating, Wells turned away, disgusted, asking new baseball. He got one, delivered another fastball, and Vaughn slugged this deep left field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, first back-to-back home runs allowed Wells April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and Yankee Stadium was silent. It would not stay that way. The moment truth Chuck Knoblauch came bottom first inning when his name was announced Yankee Stadium first time he neglected chase that memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There were no boos. It was very warm ovation. They liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch had emphasized game that he was concerned winning and rumbling World Series, not fans. But it surely made Knoblauch feel home when he realized that fans had forgiven him. Victories, more time, had healed malice Knoblauch and he could play second base earplugs. When Yankees defeated Indians, 9-5, Game 6 Tuesday night advance their second World Series three years, Knoblauch was easily most relieved player field. The awful mistake that he had made Game 2 would be forgotten. The Yankees had won pennant, and Knoblauch was celebrating much anyone. To have them act that me was tremendous, said Knoblauch, response that he received. It was great feeling, and it really helped me out. Knoblauch was wearing cap that declared Yankees champions American League 1998; Champagne dripped brim he spoke. He not look up, continued talk how he had learned lot being vilified making mistake that Little Leaguers are expected not make. Just face things and take it man and answer all questions, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see what you're made when you have bounce back something that. That's basically what I learned. If Yankees had lost ALCS, some Knoblauch's teammates had said that he would be branded villain failing pursue ball that glanced Travis Fryman's back while he was running baseline. Knoblauch had argued umpire while go ahead run scored first and Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch can watch television and read newspapers again getting queasy. That's huge him, David Cone said. That's huge me. I let them back game, and that would have been tough one if they would have come back and beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling lot better now. Knoblauch, who had two hits five at-bats, was working his second bottle Champagne five minutes reporters were allowed clubhouse. He flashed sort smile that he had not shown too much recently and, now that Yankees are World Series, Knoblauch should expect be teased his mistake. Maybe if we go all way, we'll do that, Derek Jeter said. I don't know what I'll say, I'll think something good. YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled Yankees advance Cleveland American League Championship Series. David Wells is 7-1 his career postseason and he should have additional edge Padres' lineup that is generally less effective left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches, pitched seven shutout innings pivotal Game 4 ALCS and earned start Game 2 this series. David Cone should benefit six days' worth rest when he starts Game 3, well being able pitch warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might be good it has been all year, and Mike Stanton continues be dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons concern: erratic Andy Pettitte, who needs home-plate umpire call strikes pitches low and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lost his command his last brief outing. Offense There were signs ALCS that offense is coming out its collective slump  Chuck Knoblauch is getting base consistently, Derek Jeter is back driving ball right field and middle, Bernie Williams had three hits Game 6, and Scott Brosius has been consistent force bottom lineup. But Yankees do have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed catch fastballs Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason funk is problem. The Yankees could use contribution Jorge Posada, who will start Games 1 and 2 and may get chance drive pitches low strike zone, where he can hit power. Defense The Yankees have best defense baseball, excellent middle Jeter and Knoblauch, and third Brosius. Nobody's really taken advantage fact that Williams has poor arm center field, rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn will try. The Indians expose fact that Yankees' pitchers have trouble preventing baserunners stealing second third base. Baserunning The Yankees run well they take extra bases, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams can make mistakes. The Yankees probably won't be able steal Kevin Brown, who has effective slide step, they could be aggressive Andy Ashby, or combination Sterling Hitchcock and Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except Jim Leyritz, no one San Diego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening moment. Tony Gwynn hasn't been consistent he is, Ken Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky. But Padres are veteran team capable putting ball play, getting runners base and then moving them along, and so long they are getting exceptional pitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, leadoff hitter, is adept drawing walks and Steve Finley, who has become more pull conscious last two years, could try take aim right field stands Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be factor if Yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough keep him leaning plate. Pitching Kevin Brown is best pitcher this series, capable winning three games if necessary, should Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose start him Games 1, 4 and 7. But some point, San Diego will need big outing either Andy Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting corners his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command is suspect, he gets pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball great effectiveness right-handed batters first two rounds playoffs, Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause him some concern. San Diego's middle relief is weakest aspect team, Randy Myers and Mark Langston left side (the stuff each has waned). But if lead can be delivered hands closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch ball and avoid mistakes, though they are unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez and second baseman Veras are adept turning double plays, and Caminiti won Gold Glove third base last year; Wally Joyner has good hands first; center fielder Steve Finley is extremely quick tracking base hits and returning ball infield. Tony Gwynn's range is better right field line, not nearly good balls hit gaps. The Yankees will be able run arm Vaughn left field. Baserunning Veras can steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can tight spot, well. In general, however, Padres are slow, plodding team, though Caminiti and Vaughn are good going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't make mistakes bases. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try pitch him down-and-in breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, jam him fastballs when he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter who likes pull ball. Left-handers David Wells can beat him breaking balls low and outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hitting well, he can be anxious early count, and he should be fed breaking balls out strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power anything high and plate. Because he likes pull ball, you must pitch him outer edge, occasionally jamming him keep him honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, better hitter left-handed. These days, he's good lowball hitter and can be beat fastballs zone. Wally Joyner: With runners base, he'll try jump fastball early count. Is not strong hitter and can be jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, likes hit pitches out, right field and middle. He can hit power if you make mistake breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter who will chase pitches out strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks first-pitch fastball upper half strike zone. Can struggle breaking balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent holes right now, can hit fastballs and away. Best bet is get ahead count and try get him chase breaking balls. PITCHING TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers jam him fastballs because he stands top plate, which is why he gets hit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he has tendency chase pitches his feet, if you don't get ball far enough, he can hammer ball wall right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, he sometimes will chase fastballs and away, particularly there is one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who has trouble resisting chest-high fastballs. When he lays them, he is much better hitter, and he this last game Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has great eye and will work pitcher deep count, he can be overpowered fastballs his belt. Cheats some now get his bat started, making him vulnerable off-speed pitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right moment. Is anxious and chases pitches out strike zone when he falls count, and isn't taking advantage mistakes when they're made. Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, he can also drive fastball long way when he anticipates, Cleveland's Charles Nagy now knows. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, he fares very poorly splitters, curveballs and sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like all young hitters, he has tendency expand strike zone and chase pitches out strike zone falling count. Kevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball game (91-93) mph, four-seam fastball 95-97 mph throw high strike zone, slider that breaks and away right-handed batters, and forkball that dives 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenging hitters fastballs. His curveball can be exceptional, and his changeup has improved. Throw strikes: Allowed many home runs (29) walks (29), has not allowed three-run homer or grand slam all year. Talk high expectations. It's not just man Tampa who has them anymore. Knowing their baseball well they do, everybody Joe Torre family passed tickets divisional series and league championship series just so much parsley plate life. The pressure was get World Series, so I can see all those people, Torre, Yankees' manager, was saying New York went out play here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres Stadium Saturday night. Now that Yankees are Series, their Florida-based owner and their fans and they themselves can see nothing more appropriate four more victories. Anything less 125 would feel emptiness. But why should Yankees be any different six teams that already fell bus this World Series? The gloom and doom six other cities will not compare letdown that would grip New York and owner's insatiable little heart should Yanks come short. The three-tiered playoff system has practically turned baseball football, where survival-of-the-fittest mentality produces one exalted Super Bowl champion and league full chumps and losers, condemned nether world Parcells-like demons kicking them their sore spots eternity. The World Series used be short and sweet reward excellence, that was when there were eight teams league, and winners met daylight early October. Even if Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers submission once again, well, there was always next year. But 1969, baseball began league championship series, and 1995 it began two-layered playoff system. The World Series is still different, which is why we should all resist babble post-season records flung us hyperactive computers and hyperactive broadcasters dozens different networks that carry baseball. The World Series is still competition one league that encourages pitchers be athletes and another league relatively devoid strategy. Somehow playoffs leave just everybody feeling inadequate. Think it. The Houston Astros are going feeling they cannot perform post-season. The Texas Rangers are sulking because they had best hitting league and could hardly touch Yankee pitching when it counted. In Chicago, glory winning special playoff wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs has been pre-empted. The very city that beat Cubs 1969 eastern title held parade Sosa Saturday canyons where Lindbergh and John Glenn and 1969 Mets were once hailed. Speaking indignity, there are Red Sox, whose occasional qualification playoffs is merely signal that nothing good can come it. In Atlanta, team '90s has won exactly one World Series, and now it is management keep repeating that: The main goal is get Series. This is recorded announcement. This is recorded announcement. This is recorded announcement. In Cleveland, fans had live phrase Nineteen forty-eight! being chanted Indians Bronx Yankees put Indians out misery. That leaves Padres only team virtually nothing lose. This can be good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, manager, reserve 1984 San Diego World Series team, has said: A lot players that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had little different attitude instead just saying, `Hey, we are World Series.' And this year, I think you will see players out there playing win. Torre recalled being underdog 1996, he said his Yankees felt they could beat Braves. I am sure that is way Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't predicting lot them, I am sure they are themselves, Torre said. I think getting here is where pressure is, Torre added. You want win, getting World Series is so tough playing 162 games and getting post-season and then having fight, bite and scratch and everything else get here. Torre continued: You don't think spring training that we want go and win World Series. You want get World Series. Then you get there, well, you have played well enough and won enough games, then course, we want win. As far legitimizing our season  I hate think negative terms, if San Diego happens win World Series, sure it takes little bit luster what we have accomplished getting here, I think that was our goal, initially. The key word that sentence is initially. The Yankees built insatiable demand more victories  and World Series tickets Torre family. While they're it, Yankees had better win whole thing. They are victim their excellence.

1031,"Top-level budget negotiators congressional Republicans and White House concluded another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon plans resume talks Monday morning and probably extend their midnight Monday deadline another day or two. Both sides were amiable they emerged two-hour session, they had little report and indicated that their relatively early departure, compared last three nights, should not be interpreted sign crisis or imminent peace budget talks. Sunday's discussions focused education and President Clinton's request $1.1 billion hire 100,000 teachers, aides said bargainers not delve much detail and nothing was resolved. I think we made some real progress today, we still have significant difference area education, said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief staff and top negotiator, Sunday's meeting. We're going try plow that next two days. Asked how far apart two sides were education, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, replied: I don't know. We're not together. He said two sides had made some progress, not enough. The talks came another day escalated political confrontation congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they have three weeks Election Day, tried take advantage static budget situation. Congress has passed only six 13 required spending bills and are negotiating now White House final omnibus package that will contain remaining seven bills and major issues including how conduct census year 2000, how much money provide International Monetary Fund and what conditions it should be provided, and how much emergency money provide items increased security U.S. embassies world and American farmers. Also be resolved are host issues that have little do financing and more do ideology, including environmental matters, contraception and national student testing. Republicans said president had been disengaged process, and they were irked what they said was his swooping 11th hour and pushing his education agenda apparently successful portrayal himself guardian that popular topic. Democrats countered that Republican-led Congress had done nothing all year, and cast Republicans extremists blocking president's plea more money hire teachers and modernize schools. In fact, Republican bargainers said Saturday night that they would provide money if local governments, not Washington, could decide how money would be used. Armey was one many who castigated president apparent disengagement, indirect reminder that Clinton has been steeped sex scandal and is facing impeachment inquiry House. The scant number congressional Republicans who not leave town weekend used House floor press this same message. What president? asked Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip. Maybe Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where is president? I bet American people don't know that he spent 152 days out 283 days this year fund raising, traveling and vacation. Republicans said that Clinton had participated 98 fund-raising events so far this year and that two events Monday New York, supporting Senate campaign Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring him 100. Clinton said White House that he was prepared do it takes reach resolution spending bills, and dispatched his aides Capitol Hill. He also said he would postpone Monday morning Monday afternoon his departure his fund-raising tour New York, and he canceled fund-raising appearance Florida. But high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, sides agreed they would need extend their deadline midnight Monday, when temporary financing government expires third time Oct. 1 start fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back Republicans, saying they have held slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress had been session only 108 days so far this year, unusually abbreviated period and one consumed more month drive hold impeachment hearings president. Most Americans, Miller said, had worked more 225 days. They say, `Where is president?' Miller said. The president has been waiting budget. This is first Congress 1974 that has no budget, he said, referring broad blueprint that is supposed guide spending. This is Congress that can't pass seven its appropriations bills, he said, largely because divisive splits conservative and moderate Republicans. Struggling meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday their differences education, most politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session resolving disagreements not just education, census and contraceptives. These were biggest issues that still separated two sides each tried formulate message take home voters Nov. 3 elections. On education, issue that President Clinton has propelled forefront and which Republicans do not want appear recalcitrant, sides have agreed spend more $1 billion not how spend it. The president insists that money be spent hire 100,000 teachers country so that average class can be reduced 18 students. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrats, say that local school districts should decide how money is spent, whether it be teachers or computers. As two sides broke Tuesday night, White House chief staff Erskine Bowles, president's top negotiator, emerged session saying: We don't have deal. We made some good progress. The biggest issue, still, is 100,000 teachers. He added: There are still some open issues which no agreement has been reached, he sounded optimistic session scheduled Wednesday morning. I think we've got chance wrapping tomorrow, he said. The two sides remained apart several ideological matters, including whether allow federal health plans cover contraceptives and whether allow those few plans religious affiliations refuse cover contraceptives not only religious grounds moral grounds well. They were also split how conduct census 2000, which is one thorniest issues. It is not one that moves voters, it is vital parties because it helps determine their relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles met much day speaker's office, shuttling and out ante-rooms their lieutenants giving few clues nitty-gritty details their talks. They have given themselves another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion worth spending items, they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They missed having spending bills place Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary financing federal government Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some other central issues, financing International Monetary Fund, were all nailed down, neither side was ready declare final deal all other elements budget package were place. We're splitting infinitives, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said approving money IMF. As they worked several issues, Republican leaders appeared be calculating differences their party that might sour final deal when it arrives House floor  more concern Senate floor because Senate has fewer differences its Republicans and White House. Some conservative Republicans said they were concerned emerging shape final package, particularly elements dealing family planning and emergency spending. They say president's proposals emergency spending, such items peacekeeping mission Bosnia, fixing year 2000 computer bug and providing relief American farmers, will break limits last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration said such money would come corresponding cuts elsewhere budget, conservatives say it comes raiding surplus. If Republican leaders cannot count their conservatives, they will need support Democrats pass final package. And Democrats Tuesday expressed concern some White House positions, issues census and apparent compromise Republicans aid farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader House conservatives, said he believed Republican leaders were ceding too quickly White House. He said that president appeared be getting his way some issues that what he really seemed be winning was war public relations. The president is getting what he wants; he's controlling situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears television, McIntosh said, it's reaction president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested that he could vote final accord. Most conservatives are holding out better deal we're hearing, he said, we'll probably give them vote because we don't see much better alternative happening if it goes down. Others were distressed, particularly two contraceptive issues. One would require federal health plans cover contraceptives. The other would bar overseas family-planning organizations lobbying change abortion laws other countries. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted see final language health plan measure. As it passed House and Senate, it allowed health plans religious affiliation decline offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn wants plans be able refuse such coverage moral grounds well. The plan covers five specific types contraception. Coburn said he wanted two those  Depo-Provera and intrauterine devices  be eliminated coverage because he said they interfered fertilization and were therefore considered cause abortions. Democrats Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduced contraceptive plan House, said she strongly objected Coburn's position. She said that health plans based their decisions what offer profits, not morals. The question is whether White House will insist keeping contraceptive coverage final package and will oppose moral exception. If administration allows moral exception, it could alienate some House Democrats. House Democrats are also worried direction talks are taking census. This has always loomed one biggest issues separating Democrats and Republicans. The results census help determine future power two political parties. But fact that two sides are finally talking it now indicates that they are covering full range budget matters that need be resolved. The White House has proposed buying time matter financing Commerce, State and Justice departments only five months. The Commerce Department contains Census Bureau. White House officials said this would put nettlesome issue while allowing resolution entire spending package, House Democrats worry it would be prelude giving Republicans road. Republican leaders idea postponing decision say that financing should be restricted only Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issues that have prompted repeated veto threats White House, two sides appeared be opting compromise confrontation, several disputes resolved. But few particularly difficult issues remained negotiation. A compromise was struck White House and Alaskan lawmakers logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded them question building road wilderness refuge connect two communities Alaska. A sticking point White House and congressional budget negotiators has been issue how 2000 census will be conducted, and White House is finding itself negotiating issue much House Democrats it is House Republican leaders. On Monday, White House negotiators, led chief staff Erskine Bowles, tried determine whether Democrats would accept deal finance six months departments State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees Census Bureau. The deal would put next March contentious issue whether next census would use statistical sampling supplement traditional methods counting people. Bowles told group Democrats that House Republicans were willing give number outstanding issues that were stalling final agreement budget, that they were digging their heels when it came financing census six months. The Democrats met office Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale half-year financing is that next March Supreme Court is expected rule whether using sampling is legal or constitutional. The Supreme Court has already agreed review two lower court rulings that said sampling would violate federal law. Oral arguments cases are set November. But House Democrats balked idea six months' financing census, arguing that if Supreme Court allowed sampling, Republicans would be no obligation approve money census that included sampling. The general feeling many Democrats was that if we won case, there would be lot less leverage March, especially if it was only issue left be debated, said House Democratic official who insisted anonymity. Democrats contend that now is time press Republicans, while they want complete work budget and go home campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who attended meeting Monday, said, It was, sort of, this is where we are. We've been able accomplish great things, what do you think? We made it very clear that unless census was included, some other issues, school construction, deal wouldn't be acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow Census Bureau estimate populations that are difficult count, and would have largest effect counting African-Americans cities and blacks and Hispanics rural areas, groups that are traditionally undercounted standard means. Republicans fear, and Democrats hope, that method would raise count people living traditionally Democratic areas, giving party advantage when new boundaries election districts are drawn 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, Democrats reminded administration officials that Clinton had promised that he would veto any legislation that restricted Census Bureau's ability conduct accurate census. I can't think any way that restricts census more not fully fund it, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The willingness House Democrats, including Gephardt, press president issue represents realization their leverage Clinton, who will need all their support coming impeachment inquiry. Gephardt is major player now, and irony is we helped make him that, said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who supports use sampling census. The Democrats' position also indicates how little trust many have White House this issue. The proposal finance departments Commerce, Justice and State six months is similar one reached last November Bowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea then was that holding all three departments hostage census fight would place maximum pressure all sides work out their differences sampling. But House Democrats were not consulted that agreement was struck and later grumbled it. At meeting Democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmakers dealings White House and declared that Clinton had promised that he would hold firm census and that she believed him, participant said. The statement was greeted laughter. There is certain level suspicion because there have been times when we have been cut out,said House Democratic official. But I have say, there hasn't been much evidence that, this time. Struggling meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday their differences education, most politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session resolving disagreements not just education, census and contraceptives.

But few particularly difficult issues remained negotiation. A compromise was struck White House and Alaskan lawmakers logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded them question building road wilderness refuge connect two communities Alaska. House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday require most federal health plans cover prescription contraceptives women, giving unusual victory Capitol Hill advocates abortion rights. But future measure was doubt because it was attached spending bill that includes controversial provision Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle spending bill, which would finance Treasury Department and Postal Service and which still must be approved House and Senate. The contraceptive measure would require federal health plans, which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who are child-bearing age, cover five methods contraception that have been approved Food and Drug Administration use this country  birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera. Currently, only 19 percent federal health plans cover those methods. The House and Senate approved contraceptive measure earlier this year. But opponents abortion were furious approval and persuaded Republican leaders have negotiators reopen discussion matter. The cost contraceptives has driven out-of-pocket cost health care women. And many male members Congress seemed persuaded support coverage contraceptives women, almost all 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, male impotency drug. Thursday, pressure building resolve spending bills Oct. 9, when temporary financing government expires, negotiators agreed include contraceptive measure their conference report $13.4 billion bill Treasury Department and Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who pushed contraceptive measure House, hailed Thursday's agreement first major accomplishment abortion rights advocates Republicans took control Congress 1994. She said negotiators had agreed include measure because election year they not want be perceived opposing contraception or be seen rejecting measure that had passed House and Senate. But many Democrats said were upset that bill contains provision that is seen interfering independence Federal Election Commission. That provision would require four-vote majority seven federal election commissioners every four years retain general counsel and staff director. The provision is aimed getting rid Lawrence Noble, current general counsel, who has investigated campaign finance practices groups Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure is one four related matters that have helped stall four spending bills. The three other bills that are stalled part because abortion-related matters include agriculture bill, which there is dispute whether federal Food and Drug Administration should use taxpayer money approve drugs RU-486, which induce abortions. The foreign operations bill is also stalled whether finance international family planning programs that may also promote abortion, while labor and health bill is delayed because provision that would block access minors contraception. Addressing measure insurance coverage contraceptives, Helen Alvarez, spokeswoman National Conference Catholic Bishops, said that bill was bad policy. She said contraception had failed stem number abortions, teen-age pregnancies or out-of-wedlock births. Public-relations-wise, it's good tactic them, she conceded, terms social policy, this is failure. For first time decades, Congress and White House negotiated tax and spending legislation this year budget surplus. The result was chaos. The lawmakers were never able agree budget resolution  framework which all tax and spending bills are supposed fit. This had not happened congressional budget procedures were established 1974. Then, discipline such overall plan, Senate and House could not pass eight 13 spending bills needed keep government running. So lawmakers had stay session more week longer they had hoped. Finally, they lumped all eight bills together this week and announced agreement. But only way they could get this far was resort gimmicks. One was designate $20 billion emergency expenditures so that programs not have be cut elsewhere offset new spending. This will use more one-quarter anticipated budget surplus current fiscal year. Another gimmick extended tax break Individual Retirement Accounts couples incomes $100,000 $150,000. This will actually raise small amount revenue next five years  period covered budget accounting  it will make picture considerably worse later years. As hard it was negotiate budget bad old days budget deficits, say politicians involved, it was exponentially more difficult this year. At least years past, there was common goal. As much they disagreed policy and principle, they were all aiming reduction deficit. This year, some members Congress wanted use surplus big tax cut. Others wanted pay national debt. Others wanted spend part it medical research, schools and weapons Pentagon. Others wanted spend large sums highways. Still wanted continue cutting government spending. And that was just Republicans. The Democrats had their ideas budget, and President Clinton laid his marker saving surplus way was found shore Social Security system. In budget terms, said Robert Reischauer, former director congressional budget office, this is end Cold War. There are other differences well way things were negotiated budget surplus. In 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politicians staked their careers striking budget deal lower deficit, fundamental question was how divide bitter medicine more taxes and less spending. Republicans, most part, opposed tax increases and favored cutting spending social programs. Democrats wanted raise taxes, especially rich, and protect social spending. In end, balances were carefully drawn. But plenty politicians  President George Bush, name one  lost their jobs process. This year, Democrats and Republicans alike claiming victory, burning issue was how parcel out candy. Democrats got more money education and farm assistance. Republicans got more money military and extension popular tax breaks businesses. Some $20 billion that will eat surplus really will go emergencies, relief victims Hurricane Georges. But much money, $90 million that will pay six new helicopters national police Colombia use drug interdiction, was designated emergency spending simply because there was no other way get it budget. For politicians, new way is more fun. It is hard imagine that anyone will be voted out office because this year's budget. But that not make it easier reach agreement. The other big difference is that principal fights this year were not money all. They involved delicate policy issues needle exchanges, contraception, global warming, immigration and census. In Congress, there is no consensus these matters. So only way policy could be set was wrap them giant spending bill. It may be more pleasant debate policy money. But it is probably harder find way split difference. As long surplus lasts, lack discipline that characterized budget-writing this year is likely continue. This is distressing those devoted controlling government spending. The temptation, said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman House Ways and Means Committee, is grab loot and spend it. Some conservatives sounded notes discord Friday federal spending agreement, they also said they would probably vote $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid farmers. However, no one can vote package just yet, because it is not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hailed Thursday was broad outline areas agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, not written document. That is now being crafted chairmen spending committees and their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that needed be resolved and that final document could run more 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved is dispute whether airlines can create peanut-free zone protect passengers who are allergic peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other members Georgia, major peanut-producing state, are fighting proposal, which would force airlines ban peanuts three rows someone allergy. Congress gave itself midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agreeing President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget was due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote was initially expected Friday, bill is nowhere being written. Only handful top-level bargainers  including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief staff Erskine Bowles  were room final deal. Excluded were committee chairmen and heads appropriation committees, who now must write language that will put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expects budget pass eventually, biggest defections coming conservatives who object $20 billion taken surplus address so-called emergencies and package's failure offer voters serious tax cut. The lag time bill is officially closed is making some conservatives nervous that more members will try add provisions that will further expand bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry that once hometown pork that is stuffed bill is publicly revealed, voters could put pressure members not support it. The elections are Nov. 3. But several conservatives said that these problems, they expected support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most my friends, who are predominantly activist conservatives, are split 50-50. If tax cuts were your primary thing, then you're unhappy, many conservatives have mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and far too much spending that I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member has little different focus. Souder said he liked extra money defense spending, and he liked price supports farmers. Hog farmers his district, whose biggest customers were Japan and China, had been hit hard collapse Asian markets. Several Republicans said that bill seemed skewed favor Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed curry favor Democrats shore support if House votes impeach him, and Republican leaders feared that if they had stood Clinton, they might have forced government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. Clinton was buying votes, said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He was sucking liberal Democrats so they would support him impeachment. Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said leaders seemed motivated desire avoid political damage they incurred partial government shutdowns 1995 and 1996. He also cited president's need placate left adding costly domestic programs. The combination lessons learned three years ago and scandal president's side yielded inevitable result, budget that leans way left, Tauzin said. Still, he said he would probably support bill. It won't be enthusiastically, he said. It won't be holding my nose either. I would have preferred spend more this money tax cut. I think we would have gotten tax cut, scandal. If president had not been caught scandal, he probably would have followed Dick Morris strategy and moved center. Gingrich said he recognized that some conservatives were wary agreement. But he sought reassure them that package served their interests. He cited $9 billion increase defense spending. And he noted that Republicans had blocked several items, including needle-exchange programs District Columbia, national education testing and U.S. contributions United Nations program that pays family planning China, which many Congress object because China has policy coercing abortions and forcing sterilization. Gingrich said agreement was best that could be achieved when you have conservative Republican Congress and liberal Democratic president. Some conservatives who had been especially critical were more understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader conservatives House, had denounced bill earlier Great Society type big-spending program. Friday, meeting Republicans, he said, Our leadership found themselves bad situation and good job. A few remained outright hostile bill, much hasty way which it was cobbled together what it contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens now and Tuesday. I think it's process that gives president ability stonewall very end and then hold us ransom. The Republican leadership House and Senate good job limiting highway robbery, it's still gone too far spending caps. Also angry rushed endgame was Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., who took House floor and said he could not support final bill. I'm going urge my colleagues vote `no,'  Taylor said. We have stayed here this long. We can stay little bit longer. And I am going encourage my colleagues continue vote no we are given adequate time study measure that is brought us. Voting mainly party lines question that has become touchstone debate development and preservation wilderness, Senate Thursday approved gravel road remote wildlife habitat Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice edge wildlife refuge and wilderness area Aleutian Peninsula, where it would connect isolated village called King Cove long-range air strip town Cold Bay. Without road, its backers say, 700 residents King Cove must continue use unreliable air and boat service emergencies, risking dangerous winds and seas they seek medical evacuation Anchorage. Opponents road call project unjustifiable precedent that threatens seasonal breeding grounds protected migratory birds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be better alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, was victory state's congressional delegation. But President Clinton likely veto measure, final outcome may depend whether its sponsors can insert road proposal huge spending bill that is likely emerge just Congress heads home Nov. 3 elections. Three Republicans voted bill, and six Democrats voted it. The Clinton administration has repeatedly warned that it will veto big spending bill if it contains array anti-environmental provisions that are consideration. Indeed, White House seems be itching partisan fight environmental priorities. But while many Republicans Congress still appear reluctant engage that broad fight, they were willing Thursday cast their lot Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, Republicans. A companion bill House, sponsored Rep. Don Young Alaska, also Republican, has not come floor. Even Sen. John Chafee Rhode Island, leader Republican environmentalists, voted road. Last February Chafee's staff had assembled score environmental lobbyists his office plan strategy opposing road, environmental advocates said Thursday. They speculated that senator had changed his position out deference power Stevens, who chairman Appropriations Committee exerts tremendous influence time when dozen spending bills are their final stages. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly road Alaska's senators convinced him its merits. Stevens said angry tones Thursday that two-thirds Alaska's land was limits development and that vital health services were being denied his state's residents. We can't use it permission some bureaucrat who is compelled extreme environmentalists, he said. They are so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, smallest wilderness Alaska, is so sacrosanct that it can't move its border 60 feet. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called road project dangerous precedent. Building road wilderness Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be first time nation we have voted deliberately authorize road wilderness area, Bumpers said. And once you go that road, nobody knows where it is going end. Struggling meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday their differences education, staging events demonstrate support what has become most public and politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators met night hash out their disagreements aid schools, census and contraceptives. These were biggest issues that still separated two sides each tried formulate message take home voters Nov. 3 elections. On education, issue that President Clinton has propelled forefront talks and which Republicans do not want appear recalcitrant, sides have agreed spend more $1 billion disagree how spend it. The president insists money be spent hiring 100,000 teachers country so that average class can be reduced 18 students. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrats, say that local school districts should decide how money is spent, whether it be teachers or computers. The two sides remained apart several ideological matters, including whether allow federal health plans cover contraceptives and whether allow those few plans religious affiliations refuse cover contraceptives not only religious grounds moral grounds well. And they also were split how conduct census year 2000. This is one thorniest issues. It is not one that moves voters, it is vital parties because it helps determine their relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff and top negotiator, met much day speaker's office, shuttling and out ante-rooms their lieutenants giving few clues nitty gritty details their talks. They have given themselves another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion-worth spending items, they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They missed Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary funding federal government Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some other central issues, such financing International Monetary Fund, were all nailed down, neither side was ready declare final deal all other elements budget package are place. We're splitting infinitives, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, said approving funds international fund. As they worked several issues, Republican leaders appeared be calculating differences their party that might sour final deal when it arrives House floor  more concern Senate floor because Senate has fewer differences its Republicans and White House. Some conservatives sounded notes discord Friday federal spending agreement, they also said they would probably vote $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid farmers.

","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

","Russian President Yeltsin's health was a hot topic in October.First he burned his hand.Next, in Central Asia, he cancelled public appearances and appeared disoriented.The trip was shortened due to a ""respiratory infection"".He was ordered to rest and take antibiotics.He then cancelled his trip to the Asian Summit.Although stoutly defended by his family, many Russians, including former supporters, suspect he is sicker, question his ability to do his job, and want him to resign.He has a history of health problems including heart bypass surgery.The court was to judge on whether he could serve a third term, but he already has said he will not run.","Concern over the health of President Boris Yeltsin has led many Russians to question his ability to govern.He has had multiple bypass surgery and is susceptible to respiratory ailments.Periods of illness have caused him to cancel foreign trips and on some travels, he was unable to attend all official functions.He is politically weakened, leaving others to grapple with Russia's economic crisis.Russia's constitutional court was to hold hearings on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term under their two term limitations since part of his first term was under the Soviet constitution.That appears to be moot point since he has said he will not run again.","President Boris Yeltsin's health has become a matter of great concern to the Russian leadership.The concern began in 1996 when he had a heart attack followed by bypass surgery.Illness has often sidelined him during his seven years in power.He recently cut short a trip to Central Asia because of a respiratory infection and he later canceled two out-of-country summits.This revived questions about his ability to lead Russia through any crisis.Yeltsin refuses to admit he is seriously ill and his condition is kept secret, even the cause for burns on his hands.Russia's leaders are calling for his resignation and question his legal right to seek reelection.","President Boris Yeltsin had a heart attack in 1996, followed by multiple bypass surgery.Doctors say his health is more or less normal but secrecy increases conjecture.The cause of minor burns on his hand were not disclosed.On a trip to Uzbekistan he walked stiffly, stumbled, rambled and seemed confused.Ceremonies were canceled and the trip ended a day early because of his bronchitis and a 99.3F fever.He was treated with antibiotics and ordered to bed but went to the office anyway.Calls that he turn over power were revived.He says he will not run again.He canceled an upcoming trip to Austria and sent PM Primakov in his place to an Asian summit."
1033,"Microsoft Corp. has said that material unpublished book two business school professors will be crucial part its defense antitrust trial scheduled begin next week. But judging advance copy manuscript, Justice Department and 20 states that are suing software giant will find support their arguments book well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends that its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are single integrated product. In its suit, government asserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled together get unfair edge its rival, Netscape Communications Corp., market software used browse Internet's World Wide Web. In Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape and Its Battle Microsoft, authors, Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management and David B. Yoffie Harvard business school, quote Microsoft executive saying that only third version Microsoft's browser was it integrated Windows. Microsoft hurried its first browser offerings market, book says, its race catch Netscape, then took more ambitious approach Internet Explorer 3.0, which was introduced August 1996. In that version it changed its software design use programming modules, or components, that could be put together and rearragned building blocks. In book, Ben Slivka, Microsoft general manager, is quoted saying, IE 3.0 was key thing because we componentized browser, He added, We really made Internet Explorer part Windows platform. The timing could be legally significant because its suit government cites evidence requests August 1996 personal computer makers that wanted load Netscape's browser their machines instead Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied requests, insisting its browers and Windows were single, integrated product. Microsoft's legal team obtained early manuscript new book last month, issuing subpoena Netscape executive who was given confidential copy authors review. Microsoft has also sought transcripts 44 current and former Netscape employees interviewed authors. A federal judge Boston last week denied Microsoft access that research materials, company may appeal ruling. The new book, published Free Press imprint Simon &AMP; Schuster, is being hurried print so it can be shipped days start Microsoft trial Oct. 19. But already, few quotes Netscape executives have leaked out. The authors decided send complete manuscript The New York Times and three other news organizations Monday, so that material could be read context. Microsoft intends use material book evidence that Netscape's troubles resulted largely its missteps rather any alleged predatory practices Microsoft. The book does detail where Netscape stumbled, shifting its strategy too and running obstacles its software development efforts. In private antitrust suits, argument that competitor was his worst enemy is established defense. But legal experts say that defense may well be far less effective federal case which government is seeking court-mandated changes Microsoft's business practices rather monetary damages that are goal plaintiffs private cases. It seems me that this debate Netscape's mistakes is total sideshow, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now Brookings Institution. But Microsoft has big legal team, and it seems they are working every defense they can find. The book quotes former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, saying company bungled chance win sizable share browser business America Online Inc. But that was second-chance do deal America Online, leading online service. The government's case focuses earlier deal March 1996, when America Online chose Internet Explorer its preferred browser; that bargain Microsoft agreed place startup icon online service main Windows desktop screen  prime real estate computing. For book entitled Competing Internet Time, it is intriguing that one its central themes is that Netcape got too wedded notion that Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, contrast, stuck its three-year planning horizon that enabled company, authors write, mesh its short-run tactical plans broader strategic view how win war. The book quotes Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, saying, The fact matter is that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three months. The organization also can't. You can ship products quickly. But you can't say, `Oh, we have radically new strategy' every three months. The government's antitrust scrutiny Microsoft, world's largest independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic administrations and involved hundreds government lawyers and investigators. But it has no means been example consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, all accounts, politics. Instead, software industry itself, government's pursuit Microsoft has taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved ways no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started 1989. It was November that year, hot afternoon computer-industry convention Las Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked he'd been dragged news conference senior executive IBM  which time dominated Microsoft and entire computer industry. The two companies  IBM, then leading maker personal computers and Microsoft, leader PC operating system software  were collaborating design and marketing new operating system called OS/2. But Microsoft was also beginning sell competing product, Windows. The industry trade press was full worried articles: which system was going become new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably his side, James Cannavino, IBM divisional president, said that two companies wanted clear air. OS/2 was future, he said. As Windows, he added, it would remain niche product under-equipped computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive all advanced features OS/2. Gates certainly not look happy. But he not disagree. The news conference got little attention, just few articles deep newspapers and trade publications. But few weeks later, Norris Washington, senior antitrust lawyer Federal Trade Commission, happened read one those articles, Byte magazine. IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified vision graphical operating environments, article said, and it looks sort U.S. economic model, divided lower-, middle- and upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft were colluding divide operating-system market  potential violation antitrust law. Soon FTC staff opened investigation Microsoft and IBM And that small first step, Microsoft has been unrelenting scrutiny federal antitrust investigators constantly evolving series allegations and charges, month month, year year, last nine years. Now comes antitrust trial scheduled begin Monday, multiplicity charges woven threads drawn more dozen different investigative inquiries that nine-year span. Microsoft, today most feared company software business and carrying stock-market value nearly $234 billion, presents huge and highly visible antitrust target. Yet, while company's allies ask, What is Clinton administration's political agenda going Microsoft? answer seems be there is none. In interviews, more dozen current and former senior antitrust officials  whether friends government or Microsoft  all say Justice Department's antitrust suit is natural outgrowth previous investigations. As politics, all officials agreed that antitrust division operates independent administration's political considerations. Charles Rule was assistant attorney general who headed antitrust division Bush administration, and he is now Washington lawyer who serves adviser and advocate Microsoft. When I was there, Rule said his Justice days, White House was punctilious terms never getting involved we decided do. There was no communication antitrust and other branches government. Asked if he believed that policy had changed Clinton administration, he said: Not really. I've seen nothing suggest it. Joel Klein heads antitrust division now, and interview dealing his division's role Clinton administration's technology policy, not specifically relating Microsoft case, he said: There is no statutory restriction, practical matter, civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out any political contact. Klein said, way examples, that he might discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries Defense Department or Transportation Department. But never White House, he said. For significant case, we might call White House and say `An hour now we are going hold press conference.'  The last time there was any interference, he added, was Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, lobbyist ITT Corp., was accused 1972 having written memo saying that $400,000 donation Republican National Convention had gone long way settling antitrust suits brought company Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity memo was never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In any case, Klein says, Watergate, it's been immaculate. In case Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore has ever volunteered comment. In answer question news conference May, just suit was filed, Clinton said: I have taken view that I should not comment matters Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should depart that policy this case, though it obviously will have big impact important sector our economy. But I have say, based what I know date, I have confidence way antitrust division Justice Department has handled matter. Since then, Clinton has said nothing else case, publicly least. And Gore, who generally represents administration technology issues, has never commented all. In Rule's opinion, administration would be foolish involve itself, if it were politically acceptable do so. It would be little odd administration push Justice Department this suit, he said. It would be policy mistake and political mistake. I would be hard pressed explain why they would do that. Taking sides highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly Democrats rely Silicon Valley companies political donations and support. In fact, present and former government officials all said suit was simply natural extension inquiries conducted last nine years. They began FTC. Soon Washington read that article Byte, FTC staff opened investigation Windows-OS/2 question. But has happened so years, turns market made initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned its agreement IBM, and Windows quickly grew be industry standard, while OS/2 remained cipher. But that issue faded, once government investigators began looking Microsoft they found other things that troubled them. In 1991 Washington, who still works FTC, informed Microsoft that investigation was being expanded. The agency, his letter said, was now trying determine whether Microsoft was using its dominant position operating-systems software stifle competition other areas. That general idea lies heart present suit. One former senior FTC official said commission staff had confidence case realized that Reagan-era commissioners, who had approve any suit, might have different view. We knew commission might have difficulty monopolization case, former official said. They hadn't brought case years. And fact, 1993 commission voted 2-2 question whether file formal charges. The deadlock served dismissal. Then, few months later, Justice Department decided pick case. It was farther most cases we got, recalled Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division who is now Brookings Institution. Usually case would be two or three people complaining and few documents, he said. But this was fully researched record. They gave us files and briefed us what they had done. The Justice Department lawyers picked same thread. The general idea our inquiry, Litan said, was that they should not be allowed use their monopoly operating systems cement monopoly other areas. In 1995, Microsoft and government reached consent agreement which company promised stop forcing PC makers buy one copy Microsoft operating system every computer sold  instead one every computer which operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. The company also agreed stop tying sale one software product sale another. The charges present suit are similar many ways. Even agreement, government investigations continued. That same year, Justice Department investigators showed offices Netscape Communications Corp. first time ask questions their next line inquiry. America Online had been complaining, senior Netscape executive recalled, because Microsoft was bundling Microsoft Network, competing online service, Windows. Once more, market forces overtook investigation. The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America Online prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints filled void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general who headed antitrust division, remarked: We get complaints Microsoft all time. We have become kind Microsoft complaints center. And we take them very seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In letter Justice Department, Netscape said that Microsoft was using its dominance personal-computer operating systems force or persuade computer makers favor Microsoft's browser, used explore World Wide Web, one marketed Netscape. The next year Justice Department formally charged Microsoft violating consent agreement tying sales Windows installation company's Web browser new computers. It seemed slam-dunk violation consent decree, natural extension that case, recalled Litan, who had left department then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, Appeals Court panel overturned that ruling this summer. In meantime, last May Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their new suit Microsoft, which is scheduled trial Monday. It contends that Microsoft has engaged bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar many ways numerous previous allegations and investigations last nine years. A good part this case is just Round II case we dealt Round I, early 1990s, Litan said. Or, former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly common thread that runs all way here. But years that thread has been twisted, pulled and spun hundreds different hands. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's most aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, is playing out century antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that sides are citing same rulings support their opposing arguments. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal will leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 years clashing antitrust doctrines. The case focuses Microsoft's Windows, operating system that controls 90 percent all personal computers sold today. The government says its objective is curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft asserts that case is intended give government control which features can be added Windows. However grand economic stakes, legal dispute is narrow. The government says that Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers and companies that provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them removing Windows main screen, or desktop, links sites World Wide Web run Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's contracts companies that connect people Internet and businesses that sell goods and services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some these requirements, though it could reinstate them will. Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits customers, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department says that bundling Explorer Windows 95 and inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice that forces customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers and Internet services are illegal, government says, because they are intended not only create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating systems. The latter threat is key, according Justice Department. Browsers have potential, operating system, act software platform which other programs run. So contracts intended drive browsers out market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department is that courts have provided no clear definition tying and no clear guidelines determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, who was chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, says that courts treat tying unusual practice when fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile or buttons shirts. His point, shared widely economists, is that some tying benefits consumers if, example, it results products that are easier use or enables company recover development costs. But tying can be bad if it locks monopoly power. The courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, which is nub legal dispute. Microsoft says it needs only show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes what might be called gross consumer benefits test  that it offers immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So which test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer is that no one knows sure, which is why sides can reasonably cite same cases fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski runs Aspen, Colo.  monopolist  had years sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, that gave skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, its rival's revenues shriveled and rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers. In Lorain Journal case, only local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising companies that advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled that exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court forced monopolist do business its rival, precedent that augurs well Justice Department, which seeks force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside its own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, says that cases courts threw out exclusionary practices only because they offered no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounced practices that resulted lower prices or better products or service. Nor courts either case call balancing immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, actions taken The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers installing Netscape's browser or using Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cited sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognized that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still not be allowed force surgical patients use its panel anesthesiologists if consumers wanted purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that functional interdependence Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point strong concurring opinion that called tougher standard government meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support several court rulings that allowed IBM change design its computers ways that made it hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere has government identified single case which courts explicitly called throwing out tied product basis balancing test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder is note that sole purpose antitrust law is protect consumers, so it makes no sense bless practices that provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamping out competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask court least insist that monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve services they provide customers. Experts agree that courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balancing test. But exactly how court will decide whether consumers are helped or hurt is grabs. A balancing test would have courts weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sites and features bundled Windows-Explorer package harm time diminished competition markets browsers and operating systems. But test that makes good sense theory can prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing tests are impossibly difficult and arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who is former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing is hand defendants Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues  and many antitrust experts agree  that courts have fact gravitated away balancing test simpler predation test exclusionary contracts. Under this standard, contract is illegal only if it is intended drive out competition and thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft will have easier time defending itself charge predation, which amounts victimizing its customers, it would defending itself charge that its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm good. The antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed antitrust division President Reagan, is littered contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that record leaves plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, should it hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. The legal tool that government is using its assault Microsoft Corp.  Sherman Antitrust Act 1890  is brief, vague and malleable. The combination has meant that this bedrock statute antitrust policy has been turns toothless and powerful years, depending politics and economics day interpreted courts. Sponsored Sen. John Sherman, Ohio Republican who was younger brother Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, act was passed nod popular backlash rise industrial trusts oil, steel and railroads. Farmers, laborers and small-business owners  sizable voting groups  resented trusts vehicles concentrated power. But trusts, large national holding corporations, were viewed many engines modernization and industrialization. Economists time opposed Sherman Act, and law that Congress passed was vaguely worded compromise. No one knew what impact it would have, one senator, quoted Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explained that nearly everyone agreed that something must be flung out appease restive masses. The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention conspiracy, restraint trade and attempt monopolize. Yet while Sherman Act is now interpreted Magna Carta competition, it never uses term. After it was passed, critics trusts derided impenetrable language Sherman Act and called it Swiss Cheese Act. But early 1900s, political climate had changed. The growing antagonism trusts, especially income gaps widened, was tapped avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, who became president 1901. The Sherman Act has always been elastic piece social legislation, used attack perceived exploitation and aggregation power, said Eleanor Fox, professor New York University Law School. The model trust  and principal target trustbusters  was Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made distinction good trusts, which thrived because their superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew not result inevitable economic forces because unfair business practices. Throughout 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained company and business practices its founder, John D. Rockefeller. But those years, price kerosene  burned light nation's homes declined steadily. So Standard Oil, it could could reasonably be argued, was enterprising monopoly. In early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices United States prop its profits time it was engaged price war Royal Dutch/Shell Europe, where Standard Oil face genuine competition. When consumers were hurt Standard Oil monopoly, popular support antitrust action company swelled, encouraged Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit Standard Oil was filed 1906, and Supreme Court approved breakup company 1911. Standard Oil and Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes. Both were dominant companies their day, and Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has been called modern Rockefeller. But there is no presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction Microsoft case, said Ron Chernow, author Titan, best-selling biography Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never went kind honeymoon period widespread public adulation and favorable press coverage Bill Gates has had. In summer 1995, whiff revolution was air Silicon Valley. The Internet offered new deal computing, fresh opportunity entrepreneurs try break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip personal computer software business. Leading challenge was Netscape Communications Corp., whose software browsing World Wide Web had ignited Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery movie Star Wars, referring Microsoft Death Star and Netscape leader rebel alliance. Microsoft answered vengeance. It dispatched hundreds programmers work competing browser and poured many millions dollars marketing it. It prodded computer makers and distribute its browser, folded browser its industry-dominant Windows operating system and gave browser away free  campaign intended cut their air supply, senior Microsoft executive described it. But not only competitors Netscape have encountered Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partners, its corporate customers and professional investors who finance new ventures have all collided it. A close look Microsoft's no-holds-barred push Internet software business offers window ways company uses its market muscle influence behavior virtually every player industry. Some cases recounted here figure prominently suit brought Justice Department and 20 states, scheduled go trial this month, charging that Microsoft times went too far  and violated antitrust laws. Regardless legal outcome, previously unreported details incidents suit and other examples provide more complete picture Microsoft action.  When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's its personal computers, Microsoft threatened stop selling its Windows operating system Compaq. The company quickly changed its mind.  After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft its early browser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away its browser free. The timing came rude surprise its partner Spyglass. The company lost most its revenues almost overnight, technology, which it had also been licensing companies Microsoft, suddenly became available free.  When America Online Inc., which competes fiercely Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions, went shopping browser technology, Microsoft made offer that was too good pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser main one its millions subscribers, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement desktop screen all personal computers using Windows.  When Intel Corp. began developing its Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, leading maker microprocessors that serve electronic brains most personal computers running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership Microsoft took priority.  Microsoft's reach computing has become so pervasive that nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately team top Microsoft executives learn company's plans. The goal, one venture investor observed, was stay out way steamroller. Microsoft adamantly denies that it has broken any laws these or similar situations. The company plays game business hard, and its executives acknowledge that apology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer and partners may be irritated occasionally. But company insists its actions are guided its main corporate goal bringing new technology inexpensively and conveniently millions people who use its software. Most people computer industry say that living Microsoft's world means routinely making accommodations it. Microsoft's power emanates its near-monopoly market personal computer operating systems, master control programs that run computers. Because it owns operating system, Microsoft is essential utility information age, said James Moore, president Geopartners Research Inc., technology consulting firm. It acts kind gatekeeper pipeline computing innovation, sitting there and deciding whether help some innovation or slow it down. For months, Microsoft and Netscape had talked and off, circling each other warily. But event that would define them unflinching rivals was meeting June 21, 1995, second-floor conference room Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, according Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, was high-tech equivalent storied gatherings smoke-filled railroad cars that inspired passage nation's antitrust laws century ago. On that day, they say, Microsoft made Netscape illegal offer divvy market Internet browsing software, collusion pact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft replies that prosecutors are misinterpreting routine meeting software business and that company has never tried divide browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, not attend Mountain View gathering, he consulted telephone Microsoft team. Two people who attend that June meeting have been named witnesses trial scheduled begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager new technology. In trial, government will contend that Microsoft presented Netscape all-or-nothing offer, according people who have been questioned federal investigation. Relying heavily notes taken meeting Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen and testimony Barksdale, prosecutors are expected assert that Microsoft proposal had several elements, incentives and requirements. Microsoft, according people questioned government, would invest Netscape, taking 15 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune Microsoft's operating systems so that Netscape's software would run better Windows. In return, people say, Netscape would give Microsoft seat its board, license its technology Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge its product-development efforts and not make browser next generation Microsoft operating system, Windows 95, which was shipped two months June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, people added, what it has always denied it does  used access its technology powerful lever business negotiations, offering Netscape preferential access Windows application program interfaces, or APIs, links that enable other companies' programs run smoothly Windows operating system. By turning deal, Netscape, they say, would not have that preferred access Microsoft technology  threat that Microsoft fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told colleague that encounter Microsoft June 1995 was damnedest meeting I've ever attended 35 years business. Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's money and its endorsement. Netscape would have also been free sell its browser use earlier versions Windows and use other operating systems Apple's Macintosh and Unix, powerful system used mainly corporations and research labs. But if we had licensed our technology Microsoft and stepped aside, best we could have hoped was becoming company sales $100 million or so and hoping be bought out Microsoft, said Clark, former computer scientist Stanford University who founded Silicon Graphics Inc., computer graphics pioneer, starting Netscape. We didn't start Netscape that. For any company, meeting Microsoft is charged affair. Every computing device keyboards disk drives, and every software program games browsers, must mesh smoothly Microsoft's Windows operating system. This is necessary make computers reliable and easier use, it also gives Microsoft its role industry's gatekeeper. And Microsoft itself makes all manner software products operating system, other companies are put uneasy position requiring Microsoft's cooperation be able compete it. And software industry, where every program is rendered digital code 1's and 0's, lines that divide competition and cooperation are blurred. The talk that line Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused division operating system  platform, computer terms  and application programs, sometimes called solutions, that run top operating system. The government suit states that sworn testimony, Chris Jones, Microsoft manager who attended meeting, admitted that Microsoft `absolutely' intended persuade Netscape not compete. Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, evidence mainly company's clarifying its position. If Netscape stayed applications or solutions side operating system, two companies could be partners, Microsoft said. But if Netscape tried become player platform space, they would compete. Microsoft released portions Jones deposition September evidence that government had quoted Microsoft manager out context. Q. Do you recall any discussion desire anybody part Microsoft who was participating be able persuade or influence Netscape not compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade sense force or persuade sense of, hey, we think we can have great business relationship together. Later deposition, Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any Microsoft executives intended suggest that there would be any consequences Netscape or its business if Netscape chose go platform direction you've described earlier opposed solutions direction. Jones replied: The conversation was something following: `We're platform business. We're going invest heavily this part platform because we feel it's critical our technologies. That's done deal.' And we're asking them: `What is your business? Is your business platforms or solutions? If it's platforms, we're platforms business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays such comments innocuous statements fact. But Netscape, same remarks could be taken warning, if not threat. This is because Internet browsing software had potential become alternative platform Windows operating system. The browser, sitting top operating system, could supplant Windows main desktop screen users' machines and main layer programming starting other software applications. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve powerful platform distributing and running Java, Internet programming language developed Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs essential utility computing. Indeed, Andreessen had boasted public Netscape's ambition relegate Microsoft's Windows so much software plumbing browser. By June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape serious potential challenger Windows, corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' Internet is Netscape. Their browser is dominant 70 percent usage share, allowing them determine which network extensions will catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, was move key API browser commoditize underlying operating system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and states have recently broadened their allegations Microsoft adding evidence that it tried bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other companies squelch competition. They say that Netscape meeting new evidence fits pattern behavior Microsoft, which has repeatedly tried limit competition strong-arming competitors and partners. One episode that fits pattern, prosecutors contend, was effort Microsoft pressure Intel shelve development multimedia and Internet software and limit its cooperation Netscape. Intel's main business is making microprocessor chips that act electronic brains most computers that run Windows operating system. Indeed, fortunes Intel and Microsoft are so closely aligned that two companies are sometimes referred single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employs hundreds software engineers, mainly its Intel Architecture Labs Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft are partners, they have also had their conflicts, typically direction and pace which certain innovations should be introduced personal computer industry, which they dominate together. Federal and state investigators have focused Microsoft's strong reaction work being done Intel's software engineers  sentiment expressed no uncertain terms meeting Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session was attended several executives Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated that Gates made vague threats supporting Intel's competitors and that he was livid Intel's investments Internet and wanted them stopped. Later, Intel pull back its multimedia and Internet software development. Steven McGeady, Intel vice president who attended August 1995 meeting, is scheduled appear witness government. Microsoft replies that government's accounts meetings those Netscape and Intel are fanciful distortions, created using biased selection documents and witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays utter failure accept computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely meets companies make sure their software and equipment will work well Windows. Sometimes talks, Microsoft says, go include further levels cooperation licensing technology or Microsoft investment, company discussed Netscape. In trial, Microsoft is expected argue its advance browser market was result its business acumen and Netscape's missteps. To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued subpoena last month and obtained unpublished manuscript new book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft, which is based hundreds interviews current and former Netscape executives. The book does chronicle mistakes made Netscape. But its authors, Michael Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management and David Yoffie Harvard Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all inviting retaliation competitors, government and customers, Yoffie said. Emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent what it crossing line much it did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 Microsoft executives gathered daylong retreat not far company's headquarters Redmond, Wash. The subject was Internet and how it might revolutionize computer software business. Few concrete plans were made that day, Microsoft executives insist that direction was set. Our vision outset was unite two worlds Windows desktop and Internet, said Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft executive who attended meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape browser field. To hasten its entry, Microsoft licensed its early browsing software Spyglass Inc. Naperville, Ill. The first meeting two companies was initiated Spyglass April 1994. At time, it was tiny company and eager do deal Microsoft. Spyglass was selected commercial licensee browser technology developed National Center Supercomputing University Illinois. In summer 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president Spyglass, met Clark Netscape O'Hare International Airport Chicago. The two men talked United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved business-class passengers, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, We're going take Microsoft head-on. At time, Colbeth recalled thinking himself, Great, now Microsoft will really want license me. Today, he noted: Remember, we were company couple dozen people and almost no money bank. Netscape had Jim Clark, his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing Silicon Valley. Netscape had very different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft had become quite interested Spyglass technology, Colbeth says, and two companies signed their first licensing agreement December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told him that it would eventually fold browser technology its operating system, its timing was accelerated Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft was initially hoping charge browser, Colbeth said. But Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply integrate its browser Windows would give it away. The announcement caught industry, Colbeth, surprise. At time, Spyglass had licensed its technology 82 other companies, including IBM and Digital Equipment, use their software products  licensing revenue stream $20 million year. As result Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish year, smaller Internet software companies went out business and big customers shifted Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed its payroll and scrambled new niches software industry replace its lost sales, which it succeeded doing eventually. Whenever you license technology Microsoft, you have understand it can someday build it itself, drop it operating system and put you out that business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well 1996, Netscape's share browser market continued rise, while Microsoft made little headway, though its browser was free. Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed that Netscape's browser was clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator was used 87 percent people browsing Web, compared 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, according Zona Research. So biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought it made sense give customers Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's. But Microsoft would not stand that  and Compaq had no choice give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted not only load more popular Netscape browser its machines also remove icon Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was delivered computer maker Windows 95. Microsoft informed Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, computer maker would lose its license Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director software procurement, testimony federal investigators. The ultimatum Microsoft was delivered bluntly letter headed, Notice Intent Terminate License Agreement. Faced being denied essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course and kept Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts that Windows and Internet Explorer are single product and that Microsoft alone defines what is product. Nothing its contracts, Microsoft adds, prohibits computer makers including competing technologies. While cutoff letter Microsoft sent Compaq seems unnecessarily hardball tactic when dealing its largest corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that take one letter here or one snippet e-mail there try portray Microsoft arrogant company is unfair. Noting that Compaq executive is witness Microsoft, Herbold said, We are totally dependent tremendous relationships key companies Compaq. At Netscape, however, Compaq episode was watershed. That was singular act that got me going Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic forcing Compaq buy its browser condition obtaining essential product, Windows operating system, illegal act and absolute proof that Microsoft was monopolist. After investigating incident, Justice Department and states agreed Barksdale that Microsoft was illegally tying sale one product another. Microsoft replies that it has long history adding new features its operating system. And outset, Microsoft says, it intended that Windows and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, they are now Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no product-tying violation antitrust laws. In separate case, federal appeals court sided Microsoft, upholding principle that company could put it wanted its operating system and declare it single product. But June 1996, when Compaq wanted offer Netscape product instead Microsoft's browser, most industry experts viewed browser and operating system two different software programs. It took long time integration strategy play out, said former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration was basically bolting browser Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers dealing Microsoft delicate balancing act. That balance swung sharply fall 1995 spring 1996, when Microsoft used lure giving America Online featured place Windows desktop ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed make Microsoft's Internet Explorer main browser its online subscribers, who now number more 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, Microsoft prepared introduce Windows 95, most significant improvement ever its operating system, Case was knocking door Justice Department. His complaint was that Microsoft was going place its new online service, Microsoft Network, direct competitor America Online, prominently desktop screen Windows 95, which was introduced August. This bundling tactic using industry-dominant operating system market Microsoft Network, or MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft unfair advantage young fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened and investigated. But ultimately, government decided taking any action. At America Online's headquarters Vienna, Va., Microsoft was feared and loathed time. America Online had designated Microsoft watcher, young M.B.A. who tracked its adversary's every move. Above desk his small, windowless office was picture Gates. Beneath picture, large block letters, were words THE ENEMY. Though America Online was clear leader online services business, it had ample reason worry all-out assault rival rich and aggressive Microsoft. When he had visited Microsoft headquarters couple years earlier, Case recalled, Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's options saying he could buy 20 percent America Online, all it or enter online business his and bury you. A threat or merely statement facts? A bit both, Case said recently. But he was mainly articulating what everybody that meeting kind intuitively understood. Yet 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason cooperate. With exploding popularity Internet's World Wide Web, conventional online companies, America Online and Compuserve, had provide their customers Internet access well their services. America Online had its browser, keep pace rapidly advancing technology it made sense do deal Netscape or Microsoft. For software companies, deal America Online, which had 5 million subscribers time, could mean big surge browser use and market share. Netscape seemed natural partner America Online, companies were Microsoft rivals. On March 11, America Online announce that it would buy Netscape technology, it was standard licensing deal based payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announced more significant deal Microsoft making its browser default technology  browser America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked Netscape's Navigator. To win deal, Microsoft offered give America Online start-up icon Windows desktop  precisely kind equal treatment main Windows screen that Case had asked Justice Department require Microsoft. After we agreed its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us be bundled Windows desktop, Case said. It was example Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision was that paramount corporate goal was increase browser market share protect mainstay software business. As result, its new online service, MSN, would have sacrifice important marketing advantage its main rival, America Online. It was Bill's decision, said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, referring Gates. He sent me e-mail it. He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagreed him. To other Microsoft executives, Gates expressed different view likely impact MSN. He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg that putting America Online Windows desktop would amount putting bullet MSN's head, according deposition taken Justice Department. In antitrust suit, government asserts that America Online deal shows how Microsoft used power its Windows monopoly give it edge browser war Netscape. David Colburn, senior vice president America Online who took part browser negotiations Microsoft, is witness government. Today, Microsoft has overhauled its Internet strategy focus mainly building popular special-interest Web sites fields travel, personal finance, automobile retailing and news. And it is putting these sites, e-mail and search features, all-in-one site that uses name MSN.com. I still regard Microsoft primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft has history getting it right long run, and there's no reason think it won't this business well. We will always be Microsoft's cross hairs. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters Silicon Valley, strategy today is one avoiding head-to-head competition Microsoft whenever possible. Don't do something that is Microsoft's path  that's lesson learned, observed Clark, Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, investors who finance so many nation's high-tech startups, generally follow Netscape formula these days. Yet that still leaves ample room prosper. For while competing directly Microsoft is dangerous, software industry whole is engine wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. And there is ambivalent side venture community's relationship Microsoft. For if start-up cannot steer clear Microsoft entirely, favored option is be bought out Microsoft, which has scooped many fledgling companies way acquiring promising technology and people. Microsoft understands start-up innovation and how co-opt start-up innovation better any other high-tech company, said James Breyer, managing partner Accel Partners, venture capital firm. As Microsoft has grown, it has come be seen not merely competitor force nature that shapes business environment, weather front. Microsoft is incredibly pervasive, said Stewart Alsop, partner New Enterprise Associates, venture capital firm Menlo Park, Calif. At board meetings companies which his firm has invested, two issues always come up, he said: One is price company's stock, and other is what Microsoft is going do. In last few years, Microsoft has offered its guidance almost yearly meetings senior Microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists. The meetings are part Microsoft's effort improve its sometimes prickly relations Silicon Valley. We work hard provide clarity where we're going and where we're not going, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place October Quadrus office building Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, Wall Street high-tech venture investing. Maffei led team five Microsoft executives who appeared group 40 venture capitalists, one whom stood and asked question that seemed be minds many his peers: How do I invest company that stays out way steamroller? Maffei, recalled one person who attended meeting, stood and delivered brief lecture businesses that Microsoft was likely avoid. His list included specialized software manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design and others. But, this person noted, broad swaths industry appeared be designated limits  including new software platforms that might compete Microsoft's personal computer operating system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, partner Institutional Venture Partners, leaned Vinod Khosla, co-founder Sun Microsystems and partner venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and said quietly, I guess that leaves us washing machines and toasters. Following is text first two sections Sherman Act, passed Congress 1890. As foundation which federal antitrust law has been built, act has been amended several times  elevating crime felony, increasing fines and prison terms individuals and setting fines corporations convicted violating it. In case Microsoft, government has invoked Sherman Act file civil suit that seeks change company's business practices, not criminal suit that seeks financial penalties. An Act Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination form trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, restraint trade or commerce several States, or foreign nations, is hereby declared be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall be punished fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or said punishments, discretion court. Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt monopolize, or combine or conspire any other person or persons, monopolize any part trade commerce several States, or foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall be punished fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or said punishments, discretion court. Will it matter consumers that Bill Gates isn't nice guy? Until last week, most Americans thought Gates, chairman Microsoft Corp., genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps  also self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked power personal computer. Monday, however, Washington courtroom, Justice Department began painting different, darker portrait Gates. In antitrust suit brought department and 20 states, man whose company commands 97 percent share market personal computer operating systems is being depicted Nixonian schemer who will go almost any length crush his competition. Product innovation, suit argues, is not sufficient weapon Gates. Flashing back and forth snippets Gates' videotaped deposition and e-mail messages he had sent that contradicted his testimony, government sought establish pattern threats and offers payments Microsoft chairman. It also sought cast Gates obsessed man who feared tiny Netscape Communications Corp. and its potential threat his domination market Internet browsers, software used navigate World Wide Web. Gates was portrayed Justice Department litigator David Boies schoolyard bully who rides roughshod computer industry crudeness that is stark contrast his popular image benevolent dictator and high-technology guru. According document presented Boies, example, Gates asked America Online executives 1996: How much do we need pay you damage Netscape? This is your lucky day. The implication, Boies said, was that amount was irrelevant, and that Microsoft, its deep pockets and market dominance, makes many offers you can't refuse needed achieve its goals. Microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys any hint that new image bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting company's world-famous brand name, they insist that public will continue draw distinction allegations anticompetitive business tactics and company's software. Despite what you're reading press, people judge us our products, said Mich Matthews, head Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience is that people vote their pocketbooks. So far, consumers are casting positive votes. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly profits $1.52 billion, stunning 58 percent increase level year earlier. Despite record profits, some marketing experts say that if public comes view Gates Rockefeller-style robber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer. When you have company such visible chief executive, CEO is really driver brand, said David Aaker, brand marketing expert Haas School Business University California Berkeley. There is no question this is going affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already there are early warning signals, political cartoons newspapers country bashed Gates last week. One showed him holding globe and saying, If you don't play my way, I'll take my ball and go home; another portrayed Microsoft chairman standing next henchman dangling someone window while Microsoft secretary says caller, I'm sorry, Mr. Gates is busy teaching competitor Windows. But some industry analysts believe new view Bill Gates who knows how play hardball may not be such bad thing his company. The he-said, she-said e-mail messages being dragged out court cases Washington and Silicon Valley, where Microsoft is locked legal battle its archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed some little different exaggerated trash talking that goes professional sports. It's taking what Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan say each other ball court and turning it something more sinister it really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author Stephen Manes Gates (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, there is evidence that darker view Gates and his company has so far taken root only District Columbia and Silicon Valley, where computer industry has long felt impact Gates' tactics, and where bitterness and distrust Microsoft are deep. In rest country, Gates continues enjoy great popularity. Two weeks ago, while speaking crowd almost 7,000 students Indiana University, questioner who asked Justice Department's suit was roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service Is Bill Gates high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 or threat known universe? All three, judging numerous political cartoons that popped newspapers country last week. From Chattanooga Boston, cartoonists took delight demonizing Gates, who is facing unexpected public relations challenge Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds Washington. Other cartoons ran gamut predictable (a worker, pointing aquarium which large fish is gobbling smaller ones, saying some visitors, Welcome Microsoft's research and development department) weird (a dweebish man hunched front computer screen staring words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is attack. Leave your possessions. Go desert. Await spaceship). And that was just Week One trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday pushed back starting date antitrust trial Microsoft Corp. four days, Oct. 19, while also ordering company comply Justice Department's request examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argued that allowing army government attorneys come and make demands will make it very difficult us remain business. But winning assurances government lawyers that they would make only narrow, targeted searches records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson U.S. District Court District Columbia ordered Microsoft open database perusal. Microsoft had asked that trial be delayed several more months prepare defense what it said was last minute broadening case Justice Department, which had added new evidence. Last month, government said that process preparing trial it had discovered that Microsoft tried persuade Apple Computer not market its Quicktime multimedia software Windows customers. On Thursday, Justice Department and 20 states added two new people their witness list testify Microsoft dealings Apple and Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, former Apple executive, was added witness list part describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft denies ever having made. The other new witness was James Gosling, Sun executive who led development Java, Internet programming language that Microsoft sees potential threat company's dominance software market. The government is charging that Microsoft took illegal steps prevent Java gaining wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, senior Microsoft executive who has worked Sun, and Chris Engstrom, executive who handled some Microsoft's dealings Apple. At same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that new allegations had no place case. The Justice Department, Warden told judge, was trying turn this something approximating plenary monopoly case IBM case. It becomes clearer and clearer and clearer each new filing that they are trying turn this broader case, he said. You can't have this bait-and-switch which they file complaint alleging A, B, C, and then talk whole alphabet three times over. As result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, minimum, another two-week delay, though more normal schedule would have trial start next year. The judge not respond. Instead he entered order setting Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered formal motion asking another two-week delay. A response is expected next week. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's most aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, is playing out century antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that sides are citing same rulings support their opposing arguments. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal will leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 years clashing antitrust doctrines. The case focuses Microsoft's Windows, operating system that controls 90 percent all personal computers sold today. The government says its objective is curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft asserts that case is intended give government control which features can be added Windows. However grand economic stakes, legal dispute is narrow. The government says that Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers and companies that provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them removing Windows main screen, or desktop, links sites World Wide Web run Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's contracts companies that connect people Internet and businesses that sell goods and services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some these requirements, though it could reinstate them will. Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits customers, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department says that bundling Explorer Windows 95 and inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice that forces customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers and Internet services are illegal, government says, because they are intended not only create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating systems. The latter threat is key, according Justice Department. Browsers have potential, operating system, act software platform which other programs run. So contracts intended drive browsers out market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department is that courts have provided no clear definition tying and no clear guidelines determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, who was chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, says that courts treat tying unusual practice when fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile or buttons shirts. His point, shared widely economists, is that some tying benefits consumers if, example, it results products that are easier use or enables company recover development costs. But tying can be bad if it locks monopoly power. The courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, which is nub legal dispute. Microsoft says it needs only show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes what might be called gross consumer benefits test  that it offers immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So which test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer is that no one knows sure, which is why sides can reasonably cite same cases fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski runs Aspen, Colo.  monopolist  had years sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, that gave skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, its rival's revenues shriveled and rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers. In Lorain Journal case, only local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising companies that advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled that exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court forced monopolist do business its rival, precedent that augurs well Justice Department, which seeks force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside its own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, says that cases courts threw out exclusionary practices only because they offered no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounced practices that resulted lower prices or better products or service. Nor courts either case call balancing immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, actions taken The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers installing Netscape's browser or using Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cited sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognized that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still not be allowed force surgical patients use its panel anesthesiologists if consumers wanted purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that functional interdependence Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point strong concurring opinion that called tougher standard government meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support several court rulings that allowed IBM change design its computers ways that made it hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere has government identified single case which courts explicitly called throwing out tied product basis balancing test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder is note that sole purpose antitrust law is protect consumers, so it makes no sense bless practices that provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamping out competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask court least insist that monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve services they provide customers. Experts agree that courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balancing test. But exactly how court will decide whether consumers are helped or hurt is grabs. A balancing test would have courts weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sites and features bundled Windows-Explorer package harm time diminished competition markets browsers and operating systems. But test that makes good sense theory can prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing tests are impossibly difficult and arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who is former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing is hand defendants Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues  and many antitrust experts agree  that courts have fact gravitated away balancing test simpler predation test exclusionary contracts. Under this standard, contract is illegal only if it is intended drive out competition and thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft will have easier time defending itself charge predation, which amounts victimizing its customers, it would defending itself charge that its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm good. The antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed antitrust division President Reagan, is littered contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that record leaves plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, should it hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. Shortly government filed its antitrust suit Microsoft Corp. May, Joel Klein, assistant attorney general charge Justice Department's antitrust division, met Silicon Valley executive. The executive recalls telling Klein that unless case went Internet browser market, it would have little effect Microsoft's power stifle competition computer industry. Klein replied that he understood computer executive's concerns. But he said time was running short and strongest evidence hand involved Microsoft's battle Netscape Communications Corp. market so-called browser software used navigating Internet. This is Netscape case, executive recalls Klein saying. But five months later, case that government is bringing trial Monday extends well Netscape and browser war embrace what it described recent court filing broad pattern anti-competitive conduct Microsoft. Netscape, government insists, is still prime example pattern  only one several examples. The 12-person witness list Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft reflects new evidence added case May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive, will appear first, he will be followed executives representing cross section nation's high-technology companies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online and Intuit. In bringing more ambitious, complicated case trial one it filed May, government has chosen high-risk strategy. The law states that new evidence can be added suit it is filed, not new charges. And so, his federal courtroom Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide rule out some new evidence ranging too far afield original suit. But if government wins its broadened case, court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher Microsoft. In May, government's suggested steps amounted equal treatment Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But government recently asked that judge hold separate hearing remedies, if it wins case. The remedies consideration now include more basic changes Microsoft's business practices  perhaps breakup company  intended loosen Microsoft's grip computing. That would be precisely kind sweeping reform that Microsoft's foes would applaud. The government has doubled bet and doubled stakes, said David Yoffie, professor Harvard business school who is co-author book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft camp, government's strategy is dismissed desperate act  taken court ruling June that threatened undermine antitrust suit. That ruling came separate case, involving interpretation consent decree that Microsoft signed Justice Department 1995. In June ruling, federal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem undercut assertion government's current antitrust case that browser and operating system were two separate products, bundled together and given away effort thwart competition browser market. With appeals-court ruling June, government lost heart its case, said Charles Rule, former senior official Justice Department, who is now consultant Microsoft. So it has taken blunderbuss approach scrambling throw everything it can find  evidence Justice Department has had years  gun barrel and see what hits. The June appellate ruling shake prosecution team. But mostly it strengthened hand those Justice Department who had been urging that case be broadened, according people who have worked investigation. At same time, they say, new evidence was coming investigation moved ahead and prosecutors raced meet accelerated trial schedule approved court. Speed was priority outset, they say. The Justice Department and states filed their suit May move Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, was introduced June. While not seeking block release Windows 98, government lawyers wanted get the courtroom early possible PC makers and computer users adopt this latest version Microsoft's Windows operating system, which functions central nervous system more 90 percent personal computers sold. The key allegations, government lawyers note, have not changed May  namely, that Microsoft illegally used its market power operating systems defend its monopoly position and try extend new markets. But only thing that was wrapped bow time May filing was browser, said one person who worked case. The real game plan was always get broader case. What is more, one person noted, prosecution team was not full strength shortly suit was filed. David Boies, renowned courtroom litigator and former partner Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who successfully defended IBM its 13-year confrontation government, was named special counsel Justice Department last December. But Boies, who left Cravath last year, not start working full-time Justice Department mid-April, because he was still finishing private cases his firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit filed May leaned heavily Netscape story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival browser market some 130 times complaint and supporting memorandum. But it also prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactics Sun Microsystems, creator Java, Internet programming language, and cited it example Microsoft's behavior. It was crafted template that could be added much stretching, one person involved case said. And so, new evidence piled and seemed fit pattern, Klein step step approved widening case, person said. And that explains, person continued, how it is that evidence that has been hands Justice Department years has been added case May; only gathering new evidence it become apparent that older material fit pattern current case. For example, government has added contention that Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., big microchip maker and close partner Microsoft, curb its development efforts multimedia and Internet software because they might conflict Microsoft's plans. The government contends that arm-twisting occurred meetings two companies three years ago, especially one Aug. 2, 1995, which was attended Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. Part government's evidence Intel-Microsoft episode is copies handwritten notes taken Steven McGeady, Intel vice president who attended meetings, and memo written him Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still court seal, said that Gates made vague threats and was livid Intel's investments Internet and wanted them stopped. A handwritten note, also court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, Microsoft executive, saying that Netscape is their common enemy and that Intel's role should be fill stuff and Microsoft's strategy. These documents were sent Intel Justice Department's office San Francisco November 1995, response Civil Investigative Demand  civil subpoena  served Intel Nov. 10, 1995. On its own, Intel material was intriguing, it became part antitrust suit only other evidence surfaced, one person close case said. The government is contending that Microsoft also tried urge Apple stop selling its Quicktime multimedia software Windows market and tried convince Real Networks Inc. pull back market so-called streaming software. The government case has also broadened, people involved case say, more witnesses industry have been increasingly willing testify. In beginning, most people industry believed that government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they came forward, one person said. But strength our case was perceived improve, more people were willing come forward, and things snowballed. You get Intel, it's easier get Apple and so on. ","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."

Bin Laden, believed be Afghanistan, and top aide were indicted Wednesday U.S. District Court U.S. embassy bombings Africa and are accused conspiring kill Americans United States. The State Department also announced reward dlrs 5 million bin Laden's capture. It is challenge entire Muslim world ... Bin Laden is hero Muslim world, said Omar Warsi, leader Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians Friends Prophet. If anything happens him, America will be responsible. Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers are fighting neighboring Afghanistan alongside Taliban army, which rules 90 percent Afghanistan and has imposed strict version Islamic law those areas. Warsi's group is well-armed everything machine guns rocket launchers. In Pakistan, it has been blamed killings hundreds Shiite Muslims, whom group reviles non-Muslims based centuries-old dispute who was proper successor Prophet Mohammed. Harakat-ul-Ansar, Pakistan-based organization labeled terrorist group United States, said, however, that foreigners Pakistan have nothing fear us. Harakat is considered strong supporter bin Laden, and several Harakat followers were killed U.S. missile attack alleged bin Laden terror sites Afghanistan. What United States does is their business, said Abdul Bassit, Harakat follower. He added, however, that United States should know bin Laden is good Muslim, and all Muslim world thinks he is good Muslim. The Taliban say bin Laden is respected guest who will not be extradited. However, they have set judicial inquiry accept evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activity and have promised prosecute him if evidence warrants it. Washington blames bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, Aug. 7 bombings U.S. embassies Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured estimated 5,000 people. The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing Tomahawk cruise missiles suspected bin Laden training camps eastern Afghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, damage area was not considered extensive.

The New York Times said editorial Monday, Oct. 26: Since deadly bombing two American embassies Africa August, there has been troubling accumulation evidence that State Department inexplicably ignored warnings possible terrorist attacks installations. The latest and most disturbing account suggests that nine months truck bombing Kenya, department received detailed description planned attack little strengthen security embassy. The pattern negligence demands examination Clinton administration and Congress. Shortly bombing, department acknowledged that American ambassador Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that embassy be moved safer location. Her advice was rejected. On Friday, Raymond Bonner and James Risen The New York Times reported that Egyptian now believed have been directly involved bombings outlined Kenya plot American intelligence officials last November. Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific  he said terrorists were planning detonate truck bomb embassy's underground garage  that it called more temporary increase security. Unhappily, it was discounted, thought be ruse lure embassy new security measures that terrorists could monitor and defeat. The logic this is hard fathom, and harder still explain relatives Americans and Kenyans killed attack nearly identical plan Ahmed described. Since bombings, department has been quick close embassies temporarily if attacks seem imminent. It would be interesting know if intelligence those decisions was any more credible Ahmed's warning. No one State Department is happy department's handling security matters, tendency blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening. Of course, additional money would have made it possible harden defenses more embassies, and Congress has now added security budget. But more decisive leadership department could have assured preventive steps were taken East Africa.

The Taliban, who control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday closed their three-week inquiry allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging war terror United States.

Hrawi has served nine years, including three-year extension 1995 his six-year term. Lahoud, Maronite Catholic, will keep alive 55-year-old tradition which president is Maronite, prime minister Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker Shiite Muslim. Lahoud, appointed army commander 1989 rebellion fractured military 1975-90 civil war, is credited rebuilding 55,000-strong Lebanese army and ending reign militias. Many hope he will copy his success military government, which is plagued nepotism and waste public funds. But some fear military dominance public life. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined informal invitation Lebanon's new president form next government, sparking political crisis this country it rebuilds its devastating civil war. Sources close prime minister, whose Cabinet has been care-taker capacity last Tuesday's swearing Emile Lahoud president, said Hariri turned invitation Lahoud select new Cabinet. There has been no formal announcement Lahoud reappointing Hariri prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be bargaining tactic, he remains front-runner premiership, apparent tension two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic stability it recovers 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 53, architect Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction program, has been power 1992. A billionaire businessman who made his fortune Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited restoring economic confidence and stabilizing national currency.

Lahoud had been expected issue presidential decree last week asking Hariri form next government. The decree was be issued president polled members 128-seat Parliament their choice prime minister. But many legislators, who gave their overwhelming support Hariri, not name him and, instead, left it president select prime minister. The two leaders met Friday, no presidential decree followed. The sources close Hariri, speaking condition anonymity, said prime minister's decision bow out came because he not feel Lahoud was constitutional procedures selecting premier.

Although opposition Syria's hold Lebanon's politics is common anti-Syrian politicians, it is rare somebody Jumblatt openly speak decision personally cleared Syrian President Hafez Assad who keeps 30,000 troops Lebanon. Like Jumblatt, some Lebanon fear that military man president could mean intelligence agents will track civilian life just they 1958 and 1964 presidency Fouad Chehab, only other army commander become head state. In nominating Lahoud, rules were not respected, Jumblatt said. Things were supposed run more democratic way, said Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought Christian forces 1975-90 civil war. The new president must be sworn Nov. 24, day Hrawi leaves office six-year term. Jumblatt said there is adequate political diversity and competition country, implying that choosing military man president was unnecessary. Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr sought calm fears military intrusion. He told reporters that Lahoud will keep army out politics just he kept politics out army. Lahoud, 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and political support home and has good relations Syria. He gained public admiration reuniting army fractured civil war and ending reign militias. Many hope he will cleanse government nepotism and wastage public funds. Lahoud's nomination complies tradition that president be Maronite Christian, prime minister Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker Shiite Muslim. The government is run joint efforts three officials. Jumblatt said his party will also boycott Parliamentary session amend Constitution so that senior public servants can run president. Criticism nomination process also came meeting Catholic bishops Wednesday. Nevertheless, bishops welcomed choice Lahoud, fellow Catholic, statement said. Parliament Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, popular army commander who has backing powerful neighbor Syria, Lebanon's next president. All 118 legislators present session cast votes his favor. Lahoud is be sworn six-year term Nov. 24, day President Elias Hrawi leaves office. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined informal invitation Lebanon's new president form next government, sparking political crisis this country it rebuilds its devastating civil war. Sources close prime minister, whose Cabinet has been care-taker capacity last Tuesday's swearing Emile Lahoud president, said Hariri turned invitation Lahoud select new Cabinet. There has been no formal announcement Lahoud reappointing Hariri prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be bargaining tactic, he remains front-runner premiership, apparent tension two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic stability it recovers 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 53, architect Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction program, has been power 1992. A billionaire businessman who made his fortune Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited restoring economic confidence and stabilizing national currency. The dispute appears be opening salvo struggle how Lebanon will be governed Lahoud's six-year term. Toward end former President Elias Hrawi's nine years office, Hariri virtually had free hand running country. Lahoud, 62, former commander Lebanon's army, was propelled power widespread popular backing. He pledged tough inauguration speech clean graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made his name rebuilding army it disintegrated civil war. Similar political disputes Lebanon have been solved only intervention Syria, main power broker this country. Damascus supports Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud had been expected issue presidential decree last week asking Hariri form next government president polled members 128-seat Parliament their choice prime minister. But many legislators, who gave their overwhelming support Hariri, not name him and, instead, left it president select prime minister. The two leaders met Friday, no presidential decree followed. The sources close Hariri, speaking condition anonymity, said prime minister's decision bow out came because he not feel Lahoud was constitutional procedures selecting premier. ","Lebanon's leadership changed in Nov 1998.Army commander Emile Lahoud was elected to a 6-year term as President by the Parliament and took office on Nov 24.He had the backing of Syrian President Assad, the powerbroker in Lebanon, and a special constitutional amendment in Oct cleared his way.He did not immediately ask Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to form a new government.Hariri, the nation's top businessman, had served three terms and rebuilt the nation, but some accused him of corruption.His support in the Parliament had also slipped, but many believed Lahoud was trying to assert his authority.When finally asked to form a government, Hariri refused.","Power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shiite Parliament speaker, an arrangement made to prevent a recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war.Syria, with 30,000 troops in Lebanon is the main power broker there.The Lebanese parliament amended the constitution to permit popular army general Emile Lahoud to become president.Prime minister Rafik Hariri, the architect of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction, expected to get a fourth term but a conflict with the new president led him to bow out as premier.Lebanon's economic stability has been threatened by the conflict.","Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president.Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria.It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet.31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister.Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister.Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.","Army Commander and Maronite Catholic Emile Lahoud was named Lebanon's president for the next 6 years, chosen by outgoing President Hrawi and Syria's Hafez Assad.Traditionally the president is a Maronite, the PM a Sunni, and Speaker of Parliament a Shiite.Election by Parliament is a formality.The constitution was amended to permit senior public servants to be president.Lahoud rebuilt the army and ended militia reign.Walid Jumblatt opposed a military president, fearing a return of surveillance on civilians.PM Rafik Hariri, a businessman who rebuilt the country and economy, refused his delayed re-appointment by Lahoud, who vowed to fight corruption."
1050,"Trying deflect foreign criticism crackdown democracy campaigners, China sent respected labor rights activist jail U.S. exile Sunday it prepared put prominent dissident trial. Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive nascent opposition political party potent organizer and moderate voice. He is third and most influential leader China Democracy Party tried three-week campaign that has seen least 32 members detained or questioned. For organizing party and thereby challenging ruling Communist Party, Xu, 55, is accused subverting state power, crime punishable 10 years life prison. To prevent supporters rallying Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court, police detained two Xu's colleagues Sunday and kept watch homes least two others, friends and Hong Kong-based rights group reported. As police moved Xu's friends, labor rights campaigner Liu Nianchun was taken prison camp Beijing and, his wife and daughter, was put plane Canada and then New York, his first taste freedom more 3 1/2 years. Authorities released Liu medical parole five months end his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother, exiled democracy campaigner Liu Qing. His wife claimed two years that Liu's health was worsening. But only last month authorities grant comprehensive exam. Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, 50-year-old's mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. The timing Liu's exile and Xu's trial was most brazen string high-profile dissident releases calculated influence Western governments. Human rights groups immediately denounced Liu's release cynical and manipulative. The Chinese government continues play hostage politics no true commitment international human rights standards, said Xiao Qiang Human Rights China, New York-based lobbying group that Liu Qing heads. Over two years, China tried woo West, Beijing signed two key U.N. rights treaties and won praise bringing its spotty legal system closer international standards. The ruling Communist Party relaxed some controls dissenting views academics. Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity more open atmosphere. Over six months, dissidents 14 provinces and cities have tried use Chinese laws set and register China Democracy Party. In sign opposition party's appeal, 205 dissidents China issued petition Sunday calling immediate release Xu and two other leaders, Hong Kong-based Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China reported. To wipe out opposition movement, authorities have violated recently revised laws that are supposed protect rights criminal suspects. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin Yongmin trial less four days notice given their families, instead 10 required law. Qin and third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, were also denied legal counsel. Police detained or scared prospective lawyers, forcing two argue their defenses separate trials Thursday. No verdicts have been announced. The Beijing court appointed Xu lawyer, his wife, He Xintong, suspects it is merely formality what she expects be show trial. He hasn't read whole indictment. How is he going represent my husband? He Xintong said talking lawyer and his aide. Authorities have turned requests Xu's colleagues attend trial, and He said she has been given one pass, herself. Xu edited influential dissident journal Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years prison, most them solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu has played role elder adviser dissidents. He became openly involved China Democracy Party November, organizing group's branch Beijing and nearby Tianjin. Shortly his arrest, he called party members and exiled dissidents convene nationwide congress. The trials three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China will sustain crackdown dissent throughout next year. In his second hard-line speech six days, Jiang vowed crush any challenges Communist Party rule and preserve social stability. He demanded that officials talk politics  euphemism party orders. The speech, senior law enforcement officials, used uncompromising language heard less frequently 18 months Chinese leaders sought improve relations abroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuated summary trials and convictions subversion this week three political critics who tried form opposition party. To underscore party's intolerant mood, national newspapers ran brief accounts Tuesday and Wednesday 13-, 12- and 11-year prison terms given Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai. Dissidents are rarely mentioned official media, and reports served warning China's 1.2 billion people. In speech, reported state television, Jiang said stability was crucial next year. He noted two key events political calendar: 50th anniversary Communist Party rule Oct. 1 and China's recovery Portuguese colony Macau Dec. 20. We must strengthen ideological and political education officials and raise their awareness and resistance sabotaging acts hostile domestic and foreign forces, China Central Television quoted Jiang saying. Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its head, it must be resolutely nipped bud. Jiang not exclusively target political enemies. He likened their threat that white-collar and ordinary criminals and ticked list potentially volatile problems  inefficient state industries, legions laid-off workers, stagnating farmers' incomes and corrupt officials. The emphasis stability and warnings those who would disrupt it were reminiscent party pronouncements waning years Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping. After Deng died 1997 and Jiang emerged victorious major party conclave, he projected more confident image. Reform, not stability, were bywords year. Academic debates year were boldest 10 years China's relatively controlled standards. Party leaders too touted efforts build more comprehensive, predictable legal system and won praise Western governments signing U.N. rights treaties. Our active developments foreign affairs has reached new achievements, Jiang said. Our country's stature has risen step higher. By arresting and convicting Xu, Qin and Wang less three weeks, China trampled its legal safeguards criminal suspects and raised questions its commitments U.N. rights treaties it signed 15 months. Despite swift punishments given three, dissidents have continued campaign justice. Four elder members dissident community sent letter U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson calling China stop persecuting political critics and release political prisoners. We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock long sentences given Xu, Qin and Wang and recent detentions several other Chinese, four wrote letter dated Tuesday that was released New York-based Human Rights China Wednesday. In addition, 214 dissidents China planned 100-day series rotating 24-hour fasts beginning Thursday protest sentences, Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China reported Wednesday night. The fasts were have begun lawyer Wang Wenjiang, whom authorities prevented representing Wang Youcai, and Wang Zechen Liaoning province northeastern China, two activists were detained police Wednesday evening, Hong Kong-based center said. The British ambassador Beijing, Tony Galsworthy, and delivered protest message Chinese government demanding immediate release Xu, Qin and Wang, Foreign Office London confirmed Wednesday. It was conveyed behalf European Union, United States, Canada and Norway. In stern judgments capping decisive crackdown dissidents, Chinese courts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners 13 and 11 years prison Monday trying organize opposition political party. The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli 3 1/2-hour trial Beijing was longest Chinese dissident three years. His colleague China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced 11 years, verdict announced court Hangzhou four days his trial. Xu's conviction deprives would-be opposition group potent organizer and fractured dissident community large strong and moderating voice. Xu remained defiant his tightly controlled trial subversion charges. He refused answer questions prosecutors and judges and responded only those his lawyer, court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, said. When court asked if he would appeal, Xu Wenli said he would not appeal, Mo said, quoting his client saying this is political persecution. Xu's daughter also criticized verdict. All he wanted do was advocate free speech and make sure party registers peacefully. But government failed this test, and now my father has go jail again it, said daughter Xu Jin, graduate student Boston University. Security forces have orchestrated concerted crackdown, trampling China's slim legal safeguards crush China Democracy Party. In three weeks, least 32 people have been detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading member, Qin Yongmin, have been put trial. All three were charged trying subvert China's Communist Party-led system. Xu and Qin were given less four days prepare their defenses. Last Thursday, Wang and Qin faced trials legal counsel police detained or scared potential lawyers. No verdict has been announced Qin's case. Judges Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang plotted subversion founding branches China Democracy Party cities and accepting money abroad, official Xinhua News Agency said rare mention dissident activities. The courts ruled two should be severely punished repeat offenders, Xinhua said indirect reference their previous democracy campaigning. Wary China Democracy Party's appeal, scores uniformed and plainclothes police sealed Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court Monday Xu's trial. Foreign reporters were kept 500 meters (yards) away building. Xu's wife was only friend or family member given permission watch proceedings, audience selected court officials. She was escorted her home courthouse three plainclothes officers. Hours verdict, He Xintong still had not returned home nor had she contacted her daughter. Police detained least two Xu's democracy party colleagues and kept watch houses others. Members China Democracy Party will struggle end realization democracy, said Gao Hongmin, whose home was surveillance. Gao, who helped Xu organize party's Beijing branch, said authorities would not be able arrest all party's supporters. In just six months, party attracted enough try register branches 14 provinces and cities. The U.S. government and exiled dissidents, many whom supported party's efforts, denounced sentences and called dissidents' release. We are deeply disappointed guilty verdict and extremely harsh sentence given Mr. Xu, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. No individual should be arrested, tried or sentenced exercising internationally recognized freedoms. Xu, 55, edited underground journal Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years prison, mostly solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he has been behind-the-scenes advisor host dissident activities. He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, setting independent human rights monitor and advised run local legislative seats Beijing. Xu became openly involved China Democracy Party November. Wang Youcai, student leader Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations 1989 and now 32, publicly declared China Democracy Party's formation June and said group intended challenge Communist Party's 49-year ban opposition politics. Police have sporadically detained supporters democracy party. The decisive move came Nov. 30 Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned Japan, ending busy two years diplomatic forays. In speech broadcast nationwide Friday, Jiang warned subversives trying bring system and vowed never copy Western democracy. To allay international criticism, China released respected labor rights campaigner, Liu Nianchun, 3 1/2 years prison camps Sunday and sent him exile United States. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently meeting exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted international treaty country recently signed. The reaction Chinese courts is totally unacceptable, Fischer said, calling dissidents' immediate release. The accused simply tried peaceful means exercise their right free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed China's constitution, and United Nations' International Covenant Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer said statement. Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai 13 and 11 years trying organize opposition political party. Hours China was expected sign key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled prominent human rights campaigner questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in authorities came he tried second time week legally register human rights monitoring group. Qin said civil affairs official Hubei provincial capital Wuhan accused him engaging illegal activities. The police came soon he returned home. As I'm sending this statement, Wuhan Public Security Bureau is again taking me away, Qin said hastily scrawled message bottom typed statement faxed reporters. Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned three hours being released and threatened prosecution if he persisted trying set his China Human Rights Observer. Qin hoped harassment would stop China signs International Covenant Civil and Political Rights, he said if local authorities don't observe treaty we will unswervingly push ahead protecting human rights last. China plans sign International Covenant Civil and Political Rights Monday United Nations. By time ink is dry, Blair should be landing Beijing Tuesday morning first visit British prime minister seven years. The treaty is supposed guarantee freedoms speech and assembly. But China signs, treaty would not come force ratified legislature, which may attach reservations effectively nullifying some provisions. Blair has vowed discuss differences human rights Chinese leaders. His visit has drawn appeals dissidents and international press freedom group urging him persuade Chinese leaders free political prisoners. In open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leaders say they respect human rights principles, law and practice government allows rights abuses and persecution dissidents. Thousands political prisoners are believed remain Chinese prisons, labor camps or detention centers, said letter, copy which was released Hong Kong-based Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China. The letter called release Shi Binhai, journalist who compiled popular book political change; Fang Jue, businessman who called openly political reform; and other imprisoned activists. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders urged Blair call release Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng. The three are 13 journalists imprisoned simply attempting practice their profession, it said statement. By sentencing two country's most prominent democracy campaigners long prison terms, China Monday took its harshest steps its current crackdown organized political opposition. After trial that lasted just three and half hours, Xu Wenli  55 dean dissident movement, and man who has already spent 12 years prison advocating democracy  was sentenced 13 years subversion state power. Xu's alleged crimes included helping organize new political party, calling end Communist rule interviews foreign journalists, calling independent labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 dissident abroad. He was defended lawyer who was appointed court just four days ago and met his client only once. Also sentenced Monday, 11 years prison, was Wang Youcai, 32, founder China Democracy Party, which has now been suppressed. Wang was tried subversion charges Thursday brief court session, no defense lawyer, eastern city Hangzhou. The punishment third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, has not been announced. His trial began central city Wuhan Thursday and may reconvene Tuesday, relatives said. A similarly long sentence is expected. Monday's sentences, which came just six months President Clinton's visit Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leaders move quickly political reform, were harshly criticized State Department. They also appeared spell effective end here China Democracy Party, which these three men, hundreds lesser-known individuals, tried organize recent months. The long sentences also crushed hopes many liberal intellectuals here that China's warming relations United States recent years and its signing global treaties human rights might bring significant easing political controls. Xu was tried Monday morning Beijing Intermediate Court. When brief recess three-judge panel announced his 13-year sentence, Xu stood and shouted, I protest! said his wife 28 years, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He and lawyers who were present, he shouted that judges were unfair and that he would not appeal his case because proceedings were illegitimate. With sentencing Xu, China's Communist government has silenced one its most energetic and persistent critics, one who has given his adult life cause democracy. Xu first came prominence Democracy Wall movement late 1970s, then served 12 years prison, much it solitary confinement. In last several months, sensing new opportunity speak out and making constant use fax machines and e-mail, he and Qin tried draw attention China's obligations two international covenants it has signed  one economic and cultural rights, and one civil and political rights. In face several temporary detentions and stiff warnings, they continued their activities. Wang, contrast, first became involved dissident activities 1989, while graduate student physics Beijing, when he became leader Tiananmen Square demonstrations. After student movement was smashed army, he was most-wanted list, then was arrested and spent two years prison. During Clinton's visit China June, Wang announced formation China Democracy Party. Hundreds country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting idea. But while government has allowed somewhat freer discussion political topics universities and obscure journals last year, it has not allowed any challenges  print or form organized groups  principle Communist Party rule. In speech Friday celebrating 20 years economic reforms, president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized primacy party, saying, The Western mode political systems must never be adopted. After learning Monday's sentences, American Embassy here, which has spent last two years building improved relations China and United States, issued strong condemnation what it termed deplorable decisions. We are deeply disappointed guilty verdicts and extremely harsh sentences, statement said. No individual should be arrested, tried and sentenced exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including those guaranteed International Covenant Civil and Political Rights, which China has committed itself. Like Thursday's trials, which proceeded no defense attorneys because prospective lawyers had been warned police or detained, Monday's proceeding showed that cases involving security issues, police and courts could write their rules. According criminal procedure law, defendants are be notified least 10 days trial, Xu was told only four days ago that his trial would be Monday. His wife, who Monday had not been allowed contact him his arrest Nov. 30, was told three days ago. Under law, defendants also have right lawyer their choice, Xu was assigned lawyer court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only one brief meeting, associate Mo's said. Xu's wife refused meet lawyer trial. Meeting him would be tantamount cooperating whole charade, she said telephone interview this weekend. Responding accusations Monday morning's trial, Xu's lawyer argued that Xu had engaged peaceful expression his views and that this could not amount subversive activities state, associate lawyer said. But decision that was clearly preordained, court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him spend what may be much rest his life prison. Born 1943 southeastern province Jiangxi, Xu was interested politics teen-ager, his wife said. In 1960s, idealistic Marxist, he decided get his learning society rather attend university. He served navy five years, then became electrician Beijing railroad becoming involved democracy movement and going prison. On Monday afternoon, police station hours trial finished, Xu was allowed half-hour his wife. He told me he'd be able handle pain, she later recounted telephone interview. He said that this would give him time think things and calmly reflect what has happened. Ms. He, who has been married Xu 1971, said she expected see him monthly visits prison. The couple has daughter, Xu Jin, who is graduate student fine arts Boston University. In earlier interview, soon her husband was arrested Nov. 30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, I can't change way I am. If he received long sentence, he told his wife, she should go and enjoy her life. And if I die, Xu said they parted that day, please plant tree me. Six months President Clinton traveled Beijing and challenged China's leaders move rapidly political reform, administration's policy engaging Beijing was called question Monday when Chinese courts sentenced three nation's most prominent dissidents long jail sentences. Critics China Capitol Hill and human rights groups said tough prison terms were evidence failure administration's policy encouraging trade and diplomatic ties China hopes democratic reform. The dissidents  Xu Wenli, who was sentenced Monday 13 years prison, Wang Youcai, who received 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who was reported have received 12 years were charged subversion. The State Department said it had received reports sources it not identify that third leading democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, had been sentenced 13 years prison trial last week city Wuhan. Relatives Qin China denied reports, however, and said that his trial continued. Given Clinton's effusive praise China's senior leaders his trip Beijing last summer, administration found itself defensive Monday and harshly criticized prison sentences, it continued insist that administration's policy engagement was helping push Beijing democracy. James Foley, State Department spokesman, said United States deeply deplores jail terms and called immediate release dissidents. These three men appear have been involved nothing more efforts form new political party, he said. While condemning prison sentences, Foley and other American officials were careful note administration's assessment that there had been progress human rights China, some it linked Clinton's meeting Beijing Chinese President Jiang Zemin. There had been improvements human rights situation China, modest improvements, Foley said. The severe prison terms  and other recent instances harassment democracy campaigners China  are steps backward relationship what had been improved human rights performance, he said. Critics administration's China policy noted that long prison sentences were handed out less week Jiang delivered pointed speech Beijing which he made clear that China's economic reforms were not prelude Western-style democracy. The Western mode political systems must never be copied, he said, adding that those who challenged Communist Party's supremacy would be crushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has long been China's harshest critics Congress, said prison sentences handed out Xu and Wang were clearest demonstration president's visit China last summer Beijing's true intentions human rights. They are pathetic, really pathetic, she said administration. The administration can say what it wants, it must know Monday that its policy China is embarrassment. What Chinese have learned is that they have all latitude world. Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director Human Rights Group, said jail terms were proof need administration revise its China policy, which he described almost entirely driven administration's desire encourage trade. He said that while there had been some signs progress human rights situation China last year  notably, China's agreement sign international treaties civil and economic rights  overall picture was bleak. On balance, he said, any progress China has made allowing greater openness may have been canceled out more repressive attitude. Human Rights Watch, largest American-based human rights group, called administration consider postponing or canceling planned visit China early next year Commerce Secretary William Daley and high-level trade delegation protest prison sentences. That would get Beijing's attention, Jendrzejczck said. Other China experts and scholars insisted that administration was right continue its policy engagement China, and that there was reason believe that political reform would follow economic reform, Clinton has argued. Peter Rodman, former Nixon and Reagan administration official now Nixon Center Washington, said that United States cannot control evolution society complex China's. He said harsh prison sentences given out Monday dissidents were be expected, especially Xu and Wang had been involved trying set political party challenge Communists. The pattern this regime is that every once while, they ease bit and somebody goes too far and there's crisis, he said. I don't think you can blame United States this crackdown, nor can you give us credit any political reforms. On human rights, I just don't think there's much more we can do. China released respected, ailing labor rights campaigner prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him exile United States. Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared be attempt government blunt international criticism Monday's upcoming trial prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu is third leading member would-be opposition political party put trial subversion three-week crackdown that has seen least 32 dissidents arrested or interrogated. Beijing police Sunday detained one Xu's China Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, prevent him attending trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was free, human rights groups decried Chinese government's timing manipulative. We don't want give any credit Chinese government this cynical game it is playing, said Xiao Qiang, director New York-based Human Rights China. After 3 1/2 years prison, Liu was taken Tuanhe labor camp outskirts Beijing, driven capital's airport and put Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound New York, his mother and brother said. Accompanying Liu exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 11-year-old daughter, family said. Liu Nianchun's release follows same pattern China used freeing its two most famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng Nov. 1997 and Wang Dan April. Authorities released Liu medical parole, exactly five months end his prison term, provided he go exile, said his brother and exiled democracy campaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, has been ill-health least two years. In exam authorities finally agreed provide last month, doctors discovered Liu had tumors his mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. Like Wang and Wei, United States and other Western governments have lobbied China release Liu. Chinese leaders have been forcing well-known dissidents exile throughout 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence dissidents home. In only official comment release, Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial departments took account Liu's health and behavior labor camp approving his parole medical treatment. I am very happy Liu Nianchun, same time sending people directly prison exile is type human rights violation and persecution, Liu Qing said telephone interview his home New York's Brooklyn borough. Liu Nianchun was one most respected figures fractured, persecuted dissident community. His more 3 1/2 years prisons and labor camps was sad illustration way China's Communist Party rulers punish people they deem threat. Liu was imprisoned three times 17 years. His last arrest came he signed petition calling labor rights May 1995. Liu was never put trial. Fourteen months passed his wife, Chu Hailan, first learned his fate and whereabouts: three-year spell labor camp frigid, remote northeast. His term was maximum police may impose criminal suspects trial. Labor camp officials later extended Liu's sentence year trying escape, charge Chu claimed was fabricated. Inside labor camp, Liu once started hunger strike protest his treatment. He was beaten cattle prods and confined room 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could only sit or stand. His wife endured police harassment, beatings and detentions campaigning his release. Chu was dragged away and hit security forces when she tried hand letter U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson Beijing hotel September. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently meeting exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted international treaty country recently signed. The reaction Chinese authorities is totally unacceptable, Fischer said, calling dissidents' immediate release. The accused simply tried peaceful means exercise their right free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed China's constitution, and United Nations' International Covenant Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer said statement. Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai 13 and 11 years trying organize opposition political party. His friend and political mentor is jailed, robbing their budding opposition political party its most potent organizer, Zha Jianguo is not afraid. A bag packed toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lies ready his Beijing home day Chinese police take him away. He has told police interrogators he expects be jailed, likely few years less 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli Monday. Democracy is process, and that process small number people will be sacrificed, Zha, 47-year-old former manager computer design company and vice chairman party's Beijing branch, told The Associated Press interview Thursday. We want use our sacrifice arouse people, and we believe that sacrifice is worthwhile. With mixture defiance and cool clarity chances success, Zha said he and other China Democracy Party members will continue organizing and campaigning change. His tenacity holds summary trials and harsh punishments Xu, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin  prominent party principals provinces who were sentenced 11 and 12 years  and threatening signs ruling Communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned speech published Wednesday that political subversives threatened what he called China's fragile social order. Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its head, it must be resolutely nipped bud, Jiang said. Zha maintains that such tactics are unnecessary. In its manifestoes, Democracy Party espoused peaceful means target undemocratic system, not political power Communist Party. We believe elections held establishment democratic system should decide who has power, said Zha. What many world consider democracy is legally subversive China threatening Communist Party-led system. In month, authorities have arrested and convicted Xu, Qin and Wang and detained or interrogated least 29 other party members. Police took Zha his home Sunday afternoon and held him nearly 24 hours keep him Xu's trial. Until crackdown, China Democracy Party distinguished itself attempts opposition its openness. Organizers publicly announced their intention set party. They tried register authorities. Statements were faxed foreign media and human rights groups circumvent China's state-controlled media. Now, party's members  500 Zha's count  are being driven underground. Party members will concentrate increasing ranks and will be more guarded use telephones and faxes and their occasional meetings, Zha said. If Xu and other two were first round, then second is very likely and it will be bigger, Zha said. In such unbalanced contest, we are forced use more secretive means. The arrests Xu, Wang and Qin deprive party its more influential members, Zha said. All had proven track records, Xu and Qin dissident editors Democracy Wall era movement 20 years ago, Wang student leader Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations 1989. But another aspect, this has strengthened resolve more party members struggle on, Zha said arrests. Zha got interested politics radical youth, Mao Tse-tung's appeals go countryside 1968.
