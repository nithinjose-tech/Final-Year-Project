0,d116i,"Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time. Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activities. Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT. More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight. The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have, said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program. It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't say what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new things. Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion. Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle. The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families. The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops. Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said it will release its first image  an open star cluster in the constellation Carina  a week after launch. In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time. NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space. During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years. Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end. The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion. In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive. It is the skull's third trip into space. The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. We feel very confident that things are going to go well this time, said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're going to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep trying until we do. That's kind of the name of the game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that the countdown was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect condition. The countdown got under way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be scrubbed four minutes before liftoff April 10. The unit was replaced with a new one, which tests showed to be fine. Hopefully, we'll get the shuttle off the pad this time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch time, with low clouds being the main concern, said the Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front from the north was expected to pass through the area by Monday night. The outlook is considerably better for Wednesday and Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronauts arrived from Johnson Space Center in Houston early Sunday afternoon, the shuttle Columbia was being transported to a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery. It is only the second time both shuttle launch pads at Kennedy Space Center have been occupied simultaneously. The first time was in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand said he does not believe the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast with his shuttle. NASA expects to launch Columbia with an astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier than May 16, one week later than planned because of Discovery's two-week delay. In some cases, it could be a problem having shuttles on both launch pads, Brand said. In this particular case, everything's fitting together. NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground. After that, all launch attempts must be halted for eight days so Hubble's batteries can be recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's electrical system until its two energy-collecting solar panels take over in space. Discovery's payload bay was sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey through space, astronomers expect to look back to nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most perplexing mysteries. Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble and thus provide additional targets for the telescope. The $100 million observatory also will focus during Columbia's nine-day mission on Comet Austin, believed to be on its first trip through the solar system. Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled for launch in 1986, but were delayed by the Challenger accident. The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations. We are out of the `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope. He said the telescope was running on a normal control-all mode, where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing. Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight. Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years  nearly to the birth of the universe. It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science. The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite. The antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground. Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly. We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, he said. Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed. We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode, he said. Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health. It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems, Olivier said Friday. This is not the time to do anything dumb. The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule. Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather. Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph. Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown. The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by playing the song, Cosmos. Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today, said Commander Loren Shriver. The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home. They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center. Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth. The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth. But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time. Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line. The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions. There also were two communications outages totaling several hours. Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said. NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month or two. The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe. The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion. Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation. He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away. After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds. Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled. The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later. The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned. The shuttle then backed away. Thank you very much for the ride, said Mike Harrington, director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel. That proved to be unnecessary. Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the way it did, Sullivan said. She and McCandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission. The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday Wednesday as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, above South America's eastern coast. It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge. Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stopped again. A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way. Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high above the shuttle. Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickel-hydrogen batteries. At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble is now on its own internal power, Carr said. The game has begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking. Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out. Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope. Discovery was 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere. Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view. I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said of Hawley. Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place in space. The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back. The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's scheduled liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting Hubble out of this world and in search of others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open properly. If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would be tested Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened. We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said. The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments. If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope  of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina  on Tuesday. Data will follow in a month or two. Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. They expect to determine precisely how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago. The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding. He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang theory of creation. Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on. Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved. We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard. In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees. The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies, were working well. Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems. The outage was not a problem for which space walkers would have been summoned. The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiments. Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said. The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS. This time it was a pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman. It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause. The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite. Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are a lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble had a good night while you were asleep. We appreciate the good words from everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble. The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Shriver said Wednesday. Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud of you. Scientists have hailed the Hubble  NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft  as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago. Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands. The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. Data will follow in a month or two. If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened. We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay. One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge. But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt. By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown. The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting atmosphere. Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago. The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time. Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston. As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space. Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth  higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle. There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time. Our window on the universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad. It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years, said NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's in its element and I'm delighted. The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment. It suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle. While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness. In its first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago. Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station. Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?' said Truly, a former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right. The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it flies free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side. It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling. That gave support to the theory that a massive explosion  the Big Bang  created the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago. The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe? How big is it? The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the other 12 inches. Two of the instruments are cameras, two are spectrometers and one is a photometer. In addition, the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances. On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and  after a long checkout  drop it overboard to orbit on its own. In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle. But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun. Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually. Discovery's launch was not without its problems. With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process. The problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late. The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California. On the way uphill, as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the shuttle's windshield was splattered with several flecks of things. He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit. The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative. Neither problem was considered serious. The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope. It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan. After she brings the eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the observatory. It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group runs the observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe, McAfee said. We believe the Hubble Space Telescope will do the same thing. The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego. Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement. This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy, the institute said. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly. This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding, the institute said. Hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion, called the big bang, an estimated 15 billion years ago. The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move. The institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it.","AP900424-0048,AP900422-0032,LA042590-0152,AP900428-0050,LA042290-0160,AP900425-0198,AP900426-0135,AP900424-0096,LA042590-0135,AP900428-0022",The shuttle Discovery triumphantly launches the Hubble Space Telescope.,"Two weeks after an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery roared from Cape Canaveral into orbit 380 statute miles above earth.

1,d113h,"INDIA suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of Calcutta, killing at least 45 people and injuring scores of others. Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two blocks of flats to collapse and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble. The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay. A militant Sikh group fighting for independence for the Indian state of Punjab has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts, but police are unconvinced, saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance with 'local criminals'. In what many interpreted as a reference to Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi that he suspected 'an international conspiracy.' Most of the estimated 125 people living in the Calcutta flats were in their beds when the blast occurred, setting fire to both buildings, according to officials in the city's central control room. At least 45 people were dead on arrival at hospital, they said. Last Friday a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart. Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport. The attacks in Calcutta and Bombay are a severe setback to attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India. More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6. Some fear the wave of bomb attacks is designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and undermine efforts by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. Last night national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumours after the 'inhuman and criminal blast'. A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books. The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules, including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments. It has also accused the exchange authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor administration. The stock exchange denied the allegations, saying they were 'baseless, made out of context and blown out of proportion.' The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320 points fall since the government's budget was announced two weeks ago. Yesterday the index closed at 2330. Foreign investors, who are being wooed by India as a source of much-needed capital, will also be concerned at the latest allegations of poor management at the exchange. In one of its most damaging passages, the inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas, a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's governing body, avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 4.08m). Mr Kothari said yesterday that most of the transactions covered by the report were off-exchange deals directly between financial institutions for which margin payments were not required. Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive director, said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions. Sebi also accused the exchange of mismanaging the administration of its building. This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began almost as soon as Sebi started operations a year ago. It was established by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, as a crucial element in financial reform. Brokers claim the Sebi is heavy-handed and fails to understand their needs. They say rules must be applied flexibly and many firms are extremely small and unable to carry the cost of extra regulations. But the finance minister is backing Sebi to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent budget speech. Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and others to dodge taxes and also contributed to last year's securities market scandal in which banks, including the UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost a combined gross total of Rs40bn. The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked by two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured. The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal. It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day, and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago. Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday and Tuesday. But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday, and the index came back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,409.23. All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment. Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month. He postponed corporate tax reforms by a year, denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group. He did reduce excise and import duties on a broad front, but left out the cement and steel sectors, where share prices had been boosted by pre-budget speculation. To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains. He lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent. Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices in February to make a kill later. Instead, the budget turned out to be a nightmare. While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits ex-growth this year. The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low. Overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries, arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs). The opportunity arose after a change in Indian regulations which allows international investors to convert GDRs into the underlying stock. At the current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetched Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210. The BSE 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10, from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27. Share prices rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance, has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday. Whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the ability of bulls to maintain their momentum. They are hoping that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after 'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by international investors. The Indian stock markets have been passing through a series of crises since December, when activists of the Bhartiya Janta party pulled down the Babri mosque at Ayodhya, sparking off communal riots. Mr Mark Bulloch of Jardine Fleming takes the domestic political situation in his stride. 'Nothing dramatic has happened as far as foreign investors are concerned,' he says. 'They are appraising the political situation.' In the meantime, there is no compulsion for local investors to sell. In this, they are more fortunate than they were in previous years, when they were under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gains tax exemption before the financial year ended in March. The exemption has been replaced by a flat 20 per cent tax this year which, according to dealers, puts bulls and bears on an even footing. THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand. The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart. All exploded within 90 minutes in the afternoon. Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport. The identity of the bombers was unknown, but the attacks were a severe setback to India's attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India. More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6. The bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. One of the targets was close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots, in which most victims were Moslems. National and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumours after the 'inhuman and criminal bomb blasts'. Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister of Maharashtra state, said all roads into Bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert. He said: 'It is aimed at disrupting the economy and it appears a conscious effort because only Bombay seems to be the target.' Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi: 'We suspect an international conspiracy.' The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were 'part of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time'. However, Indian officials stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan, the country's arch-enemy. The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor. At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park, hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street. Some victims were crushed in the stampede to escape. Outside, burned bodies lay among litter from shattered buildings. MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1,200 injured. 'I'm lucky to be alive,' he said from his hospital bed. 'Who did this? Who can stop this happening again?' Across Bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend. They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in December and again in January. Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya. The weapons used were mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles. Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money. The only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists. But that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in Bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital. Bombay accounts for 35 per cent of India's exports. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, described the blasts as an attack on India's economy. The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help. But these suggestions were seen in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects - Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit India after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 in Bombay. If Moslems are found to have staged the attacks, the Indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a Moslem country, notably Pakistan. The implications would be vast. Breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road. Mr Rao chose his words carefully during his visit to Bombay: 'There is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country. I do not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and outside the country.' There is no evidence linking the attacks to Moslem extremists, let alone to Pakistan. Even if Moslem groups are found to be responsible for the bombings, they could have been supplied from other Moslem countries. India would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale. For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where the atmosphere yesterday was calm. Workmen were clearing away rubble at the blast sites, including the blackened stock exchange building. Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them. At the Gymkhana Club and dozens of other sports grounds, hundreds of men and boys were playing cricket as they do every Sunday. Others were walking along the seafront by the arch of the Gateway of India. The stock exchange authorities plan to re-start trading as soon as they can  -probably today - using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last year. Businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings. They did not expect the same widespread disruption to production as occurred during the riots. Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help patrol sensitive districts. But much more should go to the people of Bombay, who, so far at least, have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bombers.","FT931-2981,FT931-4176,FT931-2858,FT931-3764,FT931-3664",Trials and Tribulation of the Bombay Stock Exchange,"In March 1993 the Bombay Stock Exchange survived a wave of selling, governmental criticism, a bomb attack that killed at least 255 people, another bombing in Calcutta killing 45, and the looming threat of war and rioting to reverse the downward trend and head upward again.","In early March 1993 the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) reacted to a postponement of tax reform.

2,d120i,"THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised some people. It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good. With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction. What piffle. Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority of 23,015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Fifteen months too late, the voters of Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury. In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public. In public, they have to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness. But in private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really is a spectacle. To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith. Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know that. In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching. To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler. No one could have eavesdropped. Their responses were true to form. But I have left out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged . . . Four-letter expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review (Arts) pages.' I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is a puzzle. First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week? They were describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements. They did not pull their punches. I bet you went chalk-white. 'So why not walk the plank, John? You are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone the cock-ups.' 'Are you sure?' the prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . how did it come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load of . . . let me put it to you - the economy, of course . . . I mean, wimpy guy like me. But I'm not giving in like that, like . . .' On and on it went. Then I rang John Smith. I told him I had been impressed with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever gets elected), including a referendum on proportional representation. I said: 'You are starting to raise your game, John. Many people will have agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation of power and the elimination of opposition'. But some of your critics still accuse you, John, of laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say to that?' 'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, a clever, sturdy fellow, but then he was sae fley'd by his showther gae a keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle. Likewise with political and constitutional reform, Michael, for by the L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, as lang's I dow]' After that, I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his views on Christchurch. But I couldn't raise the energy. Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There. I entirely concur with their choice. In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency. Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe. He has a deadly innocence. No wonder the Majors liked this film. John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's. If he did not see the similarity, that is still more revealing. Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener. In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an unknown fact: his father was once a farmer. Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'. (Well, it was obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father was a farmer. He lived on a small farm somewhere in Shropshire.' Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910. As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire. This, of course, does not mean that Major made everything up. Family folklore is a peculiar thing. Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel industry, as part of his American tour. I recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city. A farmer for Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . . . a pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all things to all people. If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point barely worth making. But it does seem all of a piece with Major's approach to wider political issues. On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe. On the other he is free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics. There are those who will argue that this merely means that Major is a typical democratic politician, that one who wants to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest, not just one. But that has not been true of Major's most recent Conservative predecessors. Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too was Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus politician'. No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his unsettled family background. His father, Tom Major-Ball, was an itinerant figure, moving from place to place, trying his hand at any number of occupations, including the circus. No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating. The only problem is the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. Except in the movies. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by winning the general election. His honeymoon, after a very personal victory, was short-lived and now he begins the second year of his hard-won term as a deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove. The past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory supporters in business. Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends that the last year has been easy,' he also claimed that much had been achieved. The government's efforts to secure a framework for long-term prosperity was beginning to pay off. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was joined by 10 frontbench colleagues in launching a counter-attack, involving a detailed and documented indictment of Mr Major's failures. He attacked the Tories for building 'a bonfire of pre-election commitments'. Tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as recession ends. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, remained cautious but volunteered: 'If I were a betting man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery.' Mr Major can take little comfort from the conclusion, widespread among industrialists, that his greatest achievement in the past year has been Britain's withdrawal from the ERM - something which he resisted and over which, in the end, he had no control. Most industrialists, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major as an individual, with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal qualities and those of his predecessor. He still attracts gratitude for the election victory, which was seen - despite subsequent problems for the economy - as the best result for business. But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he is seen as a weak leader, with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction. There is a general perception that, important though Britain's future place in Europe is, the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with community affairs and associated internal party ructions, to the detriment of the domestic economy. Many industrialists are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting to reshape economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base. But the jury is out on whether the rhetoric will give way to effective action.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The first 12 months - election victory to an initial Maastricht defeat  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- APRIL Wins election with 21 seat majority 'The country looked a Labour government in the eye and decided that it was not after all Time for a Change' - Peter Jenkins, the late political commentator 'We have won tonight a magnificent victory, a victory many people thought beyond our grasp' - Major  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAY Best Conservative local election results for 13 years in England and Wales.

Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11{ years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday morning, and Major would then be called to lead the government. Major, the chancellor of the exchequer, emerged from his official residence at 11 Downing St. Tuesday night smiling and holding hands with his wife, Norma. Inside, Mrs. Thatcher, who came next door from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street residence, embraced Major. I am thrilled and delighted that John Major is to succeed me, the Iron Lady said in a statement released by aides. It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had, Major said. Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general election, said Major, who will be the youngest British prime minister in this century. Major received 185 votes, two short of a majority. Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56. Hurd and Heseltine conceded within minutes, and party officials declared Major elected. The party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership challenge by Heseltine, who last week stopped Mrs. Thatcher short of victory in the first round of the leadership race. Mrs. Thatcher had not wanted to leave office, but she decided to resign last week after she was unable to put down Heseltine's challenge. She said she resigned to let someone from the Cabinet stand against Heseltine. Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both joined the race, but before the vote her aides spread the word that she was backing Major. The son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare recipient, Major personifies the values of self-reliance and hard work that Mrs. Thatcher had preached to the nation. His election climaxed a month of British politics-turned-upside down, and the Western world's longest-serving head of government was driven from office by a revolt in party ranks. Heading a government that was trailing the opposition Labor Party in the polls and suffering a losing streak in local Parliamentary elections, Mrs. Thatcher lost control of events after her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned on Nov. 1. Howe, the fourth Cabinet member to resign because of disputes over policy toward the European Community, shocked the House of Commons on Nov. 13 by calling Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital interests. The next day, Heseltine announced he would challenge her. Six days later, with Mrs. Thatcher at a 34-nation summit in Paris officially ending the Cold War, Heseltine polled enough votes to deny her re-election as leader. Two days later, she decided to resign after party leaders told her she could not win. Heseltine, 57, said Major's election lays the basis for the unity of our party. Hurd said the party needed to unite, and John Major is the right leader for this task. Opposition leaders derided Major's election as Thatcherism with a different face. The Conservatives' main rivals, the socialist Labor Party, demanded a general election. John Major is a Thatcherette - that is how he sought election and that is how he got elected, said Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. It means that the policies that brought the poll tax, recession, heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on. During his five-day campaign, Major had aaid he would review the poll tax, an unpopular local tax brought in by Mrs. Thatcher, but he gave no other hints of differing with her. While adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of Britain's involvement in Europe, he shares her opposition to a single European currency and shares her belief in tight restraint on government spending. However, he insisted over the weekend, I am not running as `Son of Thatcher.' I am running as myself, with my own priorities and my own programs. Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party. Tomorrow always dawns, he said, smiling after conceding defeat. Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year. He moved up quickly in the leadership race. By the weekend, opinion polls showed that Major was nearly as highly regarded by the public as was Heseltine, who has been prominent for a decade. Major attracted support from figures on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted Major's own views were more liberal than many supposed. He described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social issues.","FBIS4-24776,FT933-10917,LA112790-0154,FT942-6613,FBIS3-1707,FT932-15960,LA122190-0149,LA112890-0036,FBIS4-18298,AP901127-0119",Major Defeat; Prime Minister Leads Tories to Third Party Status,"The Tories will make Prime Minister John Major, protege of Margaret Thatcher, the scapegoat for their stunning defeat in local elections across Britain in May.

After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift. Major's comment while visiting America a month later that Iraqi troops might have to be ""forcibly removed"" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard-line on the Persian Gulf.Within a year of winning the general election, his popularity had plunged. In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015 the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Though Major's personal style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak leader, lacking vision and political conviction. Not even recent revelations that Major uses salty language can alter his wimp image.","John Major elected leader of Conservative Party, becomes next Prime Minister.","John Major emerged victorious in an election for leadership of the Conservative Party and became, at 47, Britain's youngest prime minister.

3,d117i,"Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel The Remains of the Day, judges announced Thursday. The prize is worth $32,000. Judges praised the novel, a love story about a butler's English vacation, as a cunningly structured and beautifully paced performance. Other finalists this year were Canadian Margaret Atwood for Cat's Eye, Irish author John Banville for Book of Evidence, Scotland's James Kelman for A Disaffection and English writers Sybille Bedford for Jigsaw and Rose Tremain for Restoration. After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his novel The Satanic Verses blasphemed their faith. Now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it is inconvenient for many people to support his writing, I just felt it was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him, Ishiguro said. Rushdie lives in England. Ishiguro, 39, arrived in England at age 6 and now lives in south London. He writes in English. In announcing the winner, the judges said: `The Remains of the Day' renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and explores the large, vexed themes of class, tradition and duty. It was narrowly preferred but universally admired. Ishiguro was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his novel An Artist of the Floating World. The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business. After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg. The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable. Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible. 'We had an extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after three hours of debate. Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she was made extremely cross by the decision. 'It's just a drunken Scotsman railing against bureaucracy,' she said. 'My eyes are stretched in disbelief. The voting system is completely mad. Kelman was the least favourite of the three front runners. If it had been a short story it would have been fine.' Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to have won the prize. In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some as a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: 'My culture and my language have the right to exist.' One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is.' The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoked controversy. But this year's rows have been of a particularly fine vintage. Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction. Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, was attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for the award, Ms Claire Messud, was in fact Mrs James Wood. Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the shortlist as narcoleptic. The other contenders were The Folding Star by Alan Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill Paton Walsh. In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominated have been selling 50 per cent less than last year's shortlist. Last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sold 350,000 copies. 'Kelman's novel is unlikely to come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said. Mr Kelman was also shortlisted for the prize in 1989 for his novel A Disaffection. It is a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania, and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it. Out are the eminences gris of Victorian letters - novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make the grade. This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced by six judges, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide. The winner will be revealed on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature. Like today's Booker Prize, it is a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is backing the spoof award, is a significant publisher of classic Victorian novels. But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction. It raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years. First, the similarities. A good yarn is a good yarn. Of the 1894 books, Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts. The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demons. On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend. All the books on both lists are gripping stories. The lists share key themes. Both, for instance, have books about colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which is set in the First World War in German East Africa. Both provoke in similar ways. The controversial books of 1894 were Trilby, with its louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced, impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver. It is now seen as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it. A century on, the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains vexed. Last week, a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics. But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century. For the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction. Today, we accept the gap between literary writing, such as Hollinghurst's, and popular bestsellers by writers like Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland. This is the gap the Booker tries to bridge by giving high-level publicity to works which would not normally reach a mass audience. The trick works - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback copies. Before the short-list was announced it sold 10,600. The Victorians, in contrast, were lovers of contemporary fiction. Novels accounted for 20 per cent of published books, and no distinction was made between high and low art. In the mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today. Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK was half that of today and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copies. All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later. Why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894? Social, cultural and psychological reasons play a part. Socially, the 1890s reading public was a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate was to belong to an elite. The idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction was irrelevant. Culturally, these writers and readers were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their political and intellectual forum. Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age. Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow. The dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents. George du Maurier originally offered the outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel. Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC. The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if we know them, was answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th century we have TV soaps. Just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop was running as a serial there was widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would die, and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved. Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soaps were clear features of the novel in 1894. Both In the Year of Jubilee and Esther Waters, for example, centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage, feminism and the 'New Woman', yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed. The 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet are set back from them. Trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide paved the way for Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression. It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today. Whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many of the 1994 books are historical (such as Paradise) or are driven by nostalgia (such as Beside the Ocean of Time). Which book will win on October 15? Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in Samoa, the setting of The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote, because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young man's self-discovery. My vote goes to Trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - in its anti-Semitic portrait of Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is a story of demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after better-written works have faded from memory. Like Rebecca, the popular novel by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the current Booker Prize seeks to create: a combination of the classic and the bestseller. The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who?' from many in the publishing industry. According to one insider, some on the list 'are B-team writers at best'. The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed. As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make the grade'. The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace. But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever. One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge. Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud. But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the award according to some critics. 'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must have dealt a final death blow to the Booker.' The winner, selected from an original 130, will be announced on October 11. The Booker Prize is Britain's literary event of the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in London's ancient Guildhall. The prize to the author is a check for 20,000 pounds (nearly $38,000), sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business. British publishers are very secretive about their sales but we know that when Thomas Keneally won it in 1982 for `Schindler's Ark,' his publishers, who had printed 15,000 copies, sold 75,000 over the next 23 weeks, said Christine Shaw of Book Trust. The trust is a charity promoting reading and books and administers the prize. The prize has become internationally known, and the worldwide demand for the winning book, in English and translations, is spectacular, said Shaw. The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing. British publishers can submit three new novels by British and Commonwealth writers. There were 110 submissions last year. A management committee of authors, booksellers, librarians and the sponsors chooses a jury of five: a writer or two, an academic, a politician interested in literature and a literary editor or critic. Each juror reads every book submitted, lists about six favorites and meets the other jurors to select and announce six finalists. As public debate rages over who's in, who's out and who might win, with bookmakers across the country calling the odds, the jurors meet again and finally select the winner on the afternoon of announcement day. This year's finalists: Beryl Bainbridge An Awfully Big Adventure, A.S. Byatt Possession, Penelope Fitzgerald The Gate of Angels, John McGahern Amongst Women, Brian Moore Lies of Silence and Mordecai Richler Solomon Gursky Was Here. Six novels have been nominated for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say the favorite is The Remains of the Day by Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro. The award, to be announced Oct. 26, carries a $31,600 prize funded by the Booker McConnell food company. Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about a butler's travels through Britain's West Country and said it was a firm favorite to win. Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view, said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe. The other books nominated are:  Cat's Eye, a story of painter Elaine Risley and her return to her childhood home in Toronto by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, also a previous nominee.  The Book of Evidence, a prison story of kidnap and murder convict Freddie Montgomery by John Banville, literary editor of The Irish Times newspaper.  Jigsaw, by Sybille Bedford, an autobiographical novel about an adolescent's travels through Germany, Italy and France.  A Disaffection, Scottish novelist James Kelman's story about a school teacher, Patrick Doyle, whose professional frustrations are fueled by a drinking problem and unrequited love for a colleague.  Restoration, British author Rose Tremain's story of Robert Merivel, a favorite of King Charles II who married the monarch's youngest mistress. We expect more interest in this year's Booker Prize than ever before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over Salman Rushdie's `Satanic Verses,' Sharpe said. Rushdie was nominated for the prize last year but it was won by Australian author Peter Carey for his love story Oscar and Lucinda. Rushdie, a British citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 14 when the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered he be killed for allegedly blaspheming Islam in Satanic Verses. This year's six nominees were chosen Thursday from 102 books considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for his book, Nice Work. On the day of the Big Event, Ladbroke, the large British betting agency, posted the final odds.  Brian Moore was the favorite at 7-4, followed by Peter Ackroyd (5-2), Iris Murdoch (3-1) and Chinua Achebe (9-2).  The two dark horses, Nina Bawden and Penelope Lively, were each tipped at 7-1.You may have noticed a distinctly literary tilt to that lineup, an affinity with the bookshelf, not the bookie.  All of those people published new works of fiction here in Britain during the past 12 months.  And for the last few weeks, literary punters throughout the British Isles have been placing bets on which of those writers would win the Booker Prize, the best-known, best-liked and, almost incidentally, most prestigious fiction award in the land.In recent weeks the Booker contenders have received almost as much press coverage as the Charles and Di rift.  And nearly every article, from book reviews to author interviews, has featured the latest odds.  The betting is done largely by literary insiders, says Graham Sharpe, who sets the Booker odds at William Hill, Britain's other big betting agency.  ""They read the books, hear the gossip and want to pull off a little coup for themselves,"" he says.Last year's winner, ""The Old Devils"" by Kingsley Amis, was a 5-2 favorite, but this year, anyone who chose the victor made some dough.""When she accepted her prize for ""Moon Tiger,"" Penelope Lively looked surprised and pleased.  ""I'm not a betting woman, and I have slight reservations about books becoming a spectator sport,"" she said in soft Oxbridge tones.  ""But those who are in the know tell me that 7-1 was an irresistible flutter.""  Her 65-year-old mother was among those who made a killing.America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) Booker Prize.  With the possible exception of France's respected Prix Goncourt, there's nothing quite like it anywhere else.Britons wryly compare the Booker to the Academy Awards, and though there's just one prize and no envelope, similarities exist.  There's a team of judges and a pool of candidates.  This year each British publisher could submit three new titles, for a grand total of 93.  As one judge noted wearily, ""By August, I was in more than a slight panic, sometimes reading all day and evening; reading while standing at the bus stop, reading while cooking, reading, almost, while talking on the telephone.""Next comes the ""short-list,"" the judges' top six, which was announced with great fanfare in late September.  This year the works included Brian Moore's political thriller ""The Color of Blood"" (E.P.  Dutton, 182 pages, $16.95); Peter Ackroyd's ""Chatterton"" (Grove Press, 240 pages, $17.95); Nina Bawden's ""Circles of Deceit"" (St. Martin's Press, 208 pages, $14.95); Iris Murdoch's 23rd novel ""The Book and the Brotherhood"" (Viking, 608 pages, $19.95); Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe's ""Anthills of the Savannah"" (Doubleday, 240 pages, $16.95); and ""Moon Tiger"" (Grove Press, 216 pages, $15.95).The awards presentation came on the last Thursday in October, and like any major awards presentation, it came complete with limousines, banquet (salmon mousse, champagne sorbet and English roast beef) and television cameras.  The suspense was genuine; the judges chose the winner just three hours before the announcement.To be sure, the ratings for the prime-time broadcast didn't upstage those of ""Eastenders,"" Britain's popular soap opera.  Yet interest was sufficient for Andre Deutsch, ""Moon Tiger's"" British publisher, to order up an additional 20,000 copies almost the minute Mrs. Lively -- and the nation -- heard the news.By British standards, sales figures for recent Booker winners are stunning, from ""The Old Devils"" (80,000 hard-cover copies) to Anita Brookner's ""Hotel du Lac"" (40,000 copies).  Even Keri Hulme's ""The Bone People,"" a look at Maori culture that most readers found impenetrable, reached a respectable 21,000 in 1985.Short-listed authors are just a few paces behind, sharing the best-seller list with Dick Francis and Scott Turow.  Heinemann initially printed 3,000 copies of ""Anthills of the Savannah,"" the usual run for contemporary literary fiction.  So far, 10,000 copies have sold.  ""Being short-listed probably changed the destiny of that book,"" declares a member of the Heinemann sales staff.  Indeed, there's currently talk of initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the year's best biography.Another notable spinoff is the Booker harpies, readers intent on digesting all six titles, then vigorously disputing the choices, which never please everyone.  This year the Sunday Times offered readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of $112, perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot.It wasn't always this way, of course.  Headlines were modest back in 1969 when P.H. Newby won the first ever Booker Prize for ""Something to Answer For."" (The wonderfully appropriate name comes from Booker-McConnell PLC, the international food and agriculture conglomerate that puts up the prize money each year.)The idea was to devise a British equivalent to the Prix Goncourt, and like that august French award, the Booker attracted attention the minute it kicked up controversy.  The early fuss was kept within the literary world, with critics sniping over choices and the prize's varied ground rules.  The real world took notice in 1974, when Elizabeth Jane Howard, one of the three judges, wrote a letter to the Times claiming that in her opinion Kingsley Amis's ""Ending Up,"" one of the short-listed books, was his best ever.  As it happens, she was married to Mr. Amis at the time.  He didn't win.But many credit the Booker's current appeal to the 1982 competition and Thomas Keneally's ""Schindler's Ark,"" or ""Schindler's List"" as it is known in the U.S. Written as a novel, the book told the true story of a remarkable German who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews in concentration camps.  But even after it won the Booker, people argued that it wasn't a novel.  ""The more people questioned it, the more it sold,"" says Ion Trewin, editorial director at Hodder & Stoughton.  ""That was the first year the prize caught the media and public imagination.  Suddenly the Booker gained inches on front pages.""Oh yes, ""Moon Tigers"" is a dying woman's recollection of her life as a World War II war correspondent and her affair with a young tank officer.--- Ms. Trucco is a free-lance writer based in London. Australian novelist Peter Carey was awarded the coveted Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday night for his love story, Oscar and Lucinda. A panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the $26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at London's ancient Guildhall. The judges made their selection from 102 books published in Britain in the past 12 months and which they read in their homes. Carey, who lives in Sydney with his wife and son, said in a brief speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won. If I'd known I was going to win I think I would have taken a bit more trouble with my handwriting, he said as he stared down at his notes. He was unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his novel, Illywhacker, was among the final six. Carey called the award a great honor and he thanked the prize sponsors for provoking so much passionate discussion about literature  perhaps there will be more tomorrow. Everyone who loves good books benefits from this, surely, he added. The winning novel is a fitting choice for Australia's bicentennial year. It tells of a romance between an English gambler and an Australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to Australia in the mid-19th century. The story weaves in Australian history from its founding in 1788 by British immigrants. Panel chairman Michael Foot, a writer and former leader of the opposition Labor Party, said the judges agreed that entries this year had been exceptionally strong and that choosing the last six novels was extremely difficult. We hope there will be no criticisms but if there are, then people should start reading the books for themselves, Foot said. Carey was the only non-Briton in the final six. The son of an auto dealer, he was born in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, and attended Geelong Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne, where the Prince of Wales was also a pupil as an 18-year-old in 1966. Carey was an advertising copywriter before turning to writing books in 1965. The first Booker Prize was awarded in 1969. It is administered by Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books, and is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming business. Critic and novelist A.S. Byatt on Tuesday won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award, for her tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary Victorian poets. The five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the $39,000 prize to Antonia Byatt for Possession, one of six finalists in the 21-year-old competition. Last year's Booker winner was Kazuo Ishiguro for his novel, The Remains of the Day. Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judge's panel, announced the prize at a banquet in London's Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor. There was very strong individual support for several books on the short list and finally `Possession' by A.S. Byatt was the winner by a majority vote, said the judges. The panel was unanimous, however, in agreeing that the standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult. Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work, has published five novels since 1964. In Possession, she tells how two graduate students piece together the relationship and lives of two imaginary Victorian poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets' journeys across England and to France. The influence of the past on the living is a theme throughout the book. Ms. Byatt, born in 1936, is the daughter of a lawyer and sister of novelist Margaret Drabble. Her first novel, Shadow of a Sun, concerned the efforts of a woman to escape the shadow of her novelist father. A 1978 work, The Virgin in the Garden, makes allegorical allusions to Shakespeare and other English literary geniuses in a tale of a play performed at a country house. Ms. Byatt taught English and American literature at University College in London until 1983, when she quit to write fulltime. Other finalists this year were 1979 Booker Prize winner Penelope Fitzgerald with The Gate of Angels, Irish novelist John McGahern's Amongst Women, Canadian-born Mordecai Richler's Solomon Gursky Was Here, Brian Moore's Lies of Silence, and Beryl Bainbridge's An Awfully Big Adventure. They were chosen from a list of 113 books published in the United Kingdom in 1989. The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust. It is Britain's top literary award. THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist. The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention. Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors does a disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers. This year's shortlist contains no surprises. London's litterati have for weeks been betting on Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient - those of them who have seen a proof copy because it is not officially published until next week. Last night the bookmakers William Hill made it the 5-2 favourite. The shortlist is: Serenity House by Christopher Hope (MacMillan Pounds 14.99). Black comedy by a master South Africa-born specialist in the trade. Set in a Highgate 'eventide refuge' where euthanasia is an unspoken word and its senior citizen, Max Montfalcon, turns out to be a geriatric Nazi scientist. The FT review next Saturday will describe it as 'surreal farce .. scabrously enjoyable ..' The Butcher's Boy by Patrick McCabe (Picador Pounds 14.99). An Irish murderer, a soft-in-the-head orphan jailed for life, recalls his life in grisly detail. The FT reviewer said that 'the misery and deprivation of working class life have never been so brutally evoked ..' Black Dogs by Ian McEwan (Secker & Warburg Pounds 14.99). McEwan's fiction is uniquely disturbing - some would say deliberately offensive. He is the novelist of misanthropy. This is the tale of a failed marriage, episodically told, and the black dogs of evil are both metaphorical and literal. The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje (Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99). The Sri Lankan poet and novelist Ondaatje, who lives in Canada, has followed 'in the skin of a lion' with an extraordinary book about four characters in a Tuscan villa in the closing months of the last war. The central metaphor is bombs - disposal of, and then Hiroshima. The 'English patient' is a central mystery around which the others' stories orbit: he fell out of the sky in flames; who is he? The FT review on Saturday will hail it as a masterpiece. Daughters of the House by Michele Roberts (Virago Pounds 14.99). The surprise contender because it is not yet published. Roberts comes from an Anglo-French Catholic background and this informs her new novel with a strong rural-Normandy atmosphere. Two cousins, one pious, one worldly. Shades of Saint Therese of Lisieux. Lots of action in the kitchen; something is hidden in the cellar. Sacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth (Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99).

4,d114h,"Tens of thousands of people chanting Freedom! Freedom! trekked to a Moslem saint's shrine Saturday to campaign for the secession of Kashmir from India, witnesses and pro-separatist activists said. At least three people died in two separate incidents on Saturday in Kashmir, the center of the four-decade-old separatist campaign, witnesses said. The deaths brought to 109 the number of people killed since Jan. 20 in the latest round of the secessionist violence and the government crackdown. Meanwhile, the president of the Pakistan state of Kashmir said in an interview Saturday that Kashmiris there had begun smuggling arms across the border to Moslem insurgents fighting for independence from India. President Abdul Qayyum, speaking to a reporter who traveled to Pakistan's Kashmir, said the people of his state also had been sheltering insurgents since India launched the military crackdown in its state of Jammu-Kashmir last month. In India's Kashmir, the 600-year-old shrine of Shiekh Nuruddin Wali at Charift Sharief, 20 miles northwest of Srinagar, became a sea of humanity as Moslem men, women and children poured in from Srinagar and nearby towns. Vehicles stopped 10 miles from the shrine as people thronged the roads, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Supporters of the militants said they went to the shrine to seek the saint's blessings to liberate Kashmir from India. In Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, residents were told by Moslem militants to put their clocks back by 30 minutes to correspond with the Pakistan standard time. The militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, are demanding either independence for Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state dominated by Moslems. Groups of young Moslem men sat at street corners, stopping passers-by and telling them to adjust their watches. At least six fights broke out when people refused to comply, said witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Friday, at least 200,000 people marched to the office of the United Nations Military Observers Group in Srinagar, demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir, police said. Witnesses claimed that more than 600,000 people took part. The U.N. group is posted to maintain a cease-fire line drawn between Indian- and Pakistani-held Kashmir after a 1948-49 war over the region. Residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said security forces fatally shot two men shouting anti-Indian slogans at Khrew, 15 miles southeast of Srinagar. In Srinagar, suspected Moslem militants shot and killed Ashok Kumar, a Hindu government employee, witnesses said, also speaking on condition of anonymity. Kumar was suspected to be a police informer. India routinely accuses Pakistan of arming, training and supporting the militants. The government in Islamabad denies the charge but says the Kashmiri people have a right to self-determination. An AP reporter who traveled to Pakistan's Kashmir last week said state-run banks in the region have begun collections to help the uprising. Signs in dozens of banks called for donations for a holy war against India. Naveed Hussain, a government spokesman in Pakistan's Kashmir, said in an interview that $5,000 had been raised in a week and that the money would be used to train Kashmiri militia groups in territory held by Pakistan. Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Moslems blew up a truck carrying security forces Wednesday, killing three soldiers in the few hours the government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the Kashmiri separatist uprising, officials said. In separate incidents, militants shot and killed a Moslem they said was a police informer and a Moslem died after he was caught in an exchange of fire between militants and security forces, officials said. Also Wednesday, Moslem snipers fired on security forces in three parts of Srinagar during a five-hour relaxation of curfew, said Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state. There were no casualties, he said. The curfew was relaxed from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. to allow people in the city of 1 million to shop for food and other essentials. An around-the-clock curfew was imposed Friday after security forces the day before shot and killed 49 Moslem demonstrators marching into Srinagar to take part in a pro-independence rally. At least 1 million Moslems demonstrated to demand independence for the predominantly Moslem state; India is predominantly Hindu. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, is the center of the separatist movement. At least 171 people have been killed in Kashmir since a government crackdown on the separatist movement began on Jan. 20. Leading national parties decided Wednesday to send a high-powered delegation to Srinagar, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. It did not name the members, but it said they would go Thursday. The decision was taken at the end of a daylong multiparty meeting on Kashmir called by Prime Minister V.P. Singh. A joint statement after the meeting said despite their ideological and political differences, (the parties) were one in defending the unity and integrity of the country, the news agency reported. Jagmohan said the truck was driving around Srinagar distributing food to troops on street corners when it was blown up by Moslem militants. He gave no further details of the attack. The attacks came amid government claims that security forces arrested at least 12 leaders of the Moslem group Hezbul Mujahedeen. Jagmohan said the militants, from Srinagar and the border towns of Baramulla and Kupwara, have been arrested since Sunday. Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of 30 militant groups fighting for secession. It is believed the second most powerful independence group after the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. We are going to hit hard at anti-national elements, there is no way they can get away with what they are doing, Jagmohan said. It may take a month, six months, maybe a year, but ultimately these anti-national elments are going to be neutralized. Jagmohan, a Hindu, was appointed the state governor of Jammu-Kashmir on Jan. 18 in an attempt by the government to control the unrest. Kashmir has been a problem for more than four decades following the 1947 partition of British colonial India into predominantly Moslem Pakistan and the mostly Hindu India. Jammu-Kashmir, then a princely state, chose to merge with India. Pakistan protested, claiming the territory because of its predominantly Moslem population. The two countries have twice gone to war over the territory. The Kashmir portion of Jammu-Kashmir is mostly Moslem, while the southern Jammu segment is predominantly Hindu. Overall, about 65 percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people and Hindus account for 82 percent. Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of houseboat hotels and Mogul gardens from whose name the English made cashmere, has become a war zone of separatism and religious enmity. Military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil servants around Srinagar in these dangerous days, as soldiers and paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem separatists in the Kashmir Valley. Intelligence officer M.K. Kaul commands one of the jeeps. At the beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turned to the four soldiers in the jeep's rear seats and ordered: Check your weapons. Be ready to fire. Kaul settled into the front seat, a 9mm pistol in his right hand. These are bad days, he murmured. These die-hard terrorists can attack from anywhere. To his men, he said: Shoot them if you see them. On Monday, an around-the-clock curfew was lifted from 5 a.m. until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers. Soldiers in sandbagged bunkers, armed with light machine guns, guarded main intersections. A spokesman for the Jammu-Kashmir state government said the situation was peaceful and absolutely normal in Srinagar, the state's largest city. At least 72 people have been killed since the crackdown began Jan. 20 in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and buildings. Most of the dead have been Moslem militants shot by Indian troops. We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any popular movement, said Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority. We are fighting a handful of terrorists who are determined to create a law and order problem, said Jagmohan, a Hindu with a reputation for toughness. Other officials in Kashmir say privately the situation is critical, perhaps the most serious threat India has faced in 42 years of independence from Britain. It looks like everyone here has turned into a fundamentalist with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become independent, a state police officer said. Kashmir was a separate kingdom, ruled by a Hindu maharajah, when Britain relinquished colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1947, and the subcontinent was partitioned on religious lines into India and Pakistan. The Hindu king opted to join India, not Pakistan, and the dispute over Kashmir has exacerbated relations since. Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the eastern. Each accused the other of forcible occupation. They have fought wars over Kashmir and the border question remains unresolved. U.N. observers are stationed on the truce line and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire. Officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to the Kashmir Valley since Jan. 20, but reports from various sources indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have been deployed. It is the valley's heavily Moslem population that tilts the sectarian scale in Jammu-Kashmir state. Of the state's nearly 6 million people, 64 percent are Moslems and 32 percent Hindus. Most Hindus live in the southern Jammu area. Srinagar has 150 mosques. This is the best breeding ground for Moslem fundamentalism, said a federal official who helps coordinate the new security measures. Nearly every mosque has a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to prayer  and, more recently, to exhort listeners to defend their faith and Kashmir. The residents are constantly bombarded with Islamic sermons and are reminded that fighting a `jihad' (Islamic holy war) is the most sacred duty of every Moslem, the federal official said, on condition of anonymity. Electricity was cut off in the city Friday, which was both the Moslem sabbath and India's national Republic Day on India's Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating because militants connected them to car batteries. Intelligence reports suggest the government has an advantage because the separatists are not united. The most powerful group is the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, but there are several others, including the Allah Tigers, Hezb-e-Mujahed Hezb-e-Islami. India claims the fundamentalists get money and weapons from Pakistan. The Pakistanis deny it. Jagmohan, the governor, insists the main issue in Kashmir is economic development, not separatism. The people do not want violence or the so-called independent Kashmir, he said. The need of the hour is development. Let more tourists come. Let new schools be built. Let new hospitals come up. As he spoke, military officers waited in the next room to discuss a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist brochures call Paradise. Right now, Paradise looks lost, at least temporarily. The army on Tuesday dispatched tanks and troop reinforcements to the frontier with Pakistan, where soldiers from the two nations have been fighting recently, officials and witnesses said. Prime Minister V.P. Singh told Parliament that Indian armed forces were fully prepared to effectively deal with any eventuality. Indian and Pakistani troops clashed in a remote border area in the disputed Kashmir region Monday. Singh, who is also defense minister, said exchange of fire also occurred Tuesday. In Pakistan, a Defense Ministry spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said Tuesday that Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchanged artillery fire in the Kel sector along the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir into Pakistani and Indian regions. He said there were no casualties among Pakistani soldiers. The Pakistani official also said that on Monday and Tuesday, Indian soldiers fired on Pakistani civilians traveling on a mountain road, injuring four people. He also said Indian soldiers fired on an ambulance and a bus. There was no report from India on the alleged firing. Despite the tension, officials from both sides said the incidents did not appear to be serious. There is no cause for any undue concern since we trust that these localized incidents will be contained and the situation defused, United News of India quoted Singh as saying in the Parliament. Singh said directors of military operations from both countries were in touch. He did not elaborate. The Pakistani official said: This is not a serious situation. It's just in one sector. It could be just a local incident. We don't know what it will lead to. We'll just have to wait and see. India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir, in 1965 and 1971. Both sides claim Kashmir, which has been divided into Indian and Pakistani sectors. Tensions over Kashmir flared again this summer. India accuses Pakistan of supporting a Moslem secessionist movement in the Indian sector by providing arms and training to Moslem militants. Pakistan, an Islamic state, denies the charge but says it will back any movement for self-determination by Kashmir's people. Jammu-Kashmir state is the only one of India's states with a Moslem majority. At least 1,034 people have been killed in the Kashmir valley since New Delhi cracked down on the secessionist movement on Jan. 20. Military officials in Jammu, the summer capital of India-held Kashmir, said Tuesday that tanks and troops reinforcements were dispatched to the border areas. At least 20 tanks and 30 trucks with soldiers left their quarters at Kaluchak and Baridrahamna for the frontier, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Indian military officials said the additional troops were sent to Rajauri and Poonch sectors, which were the scenes of fierce battles in the wars of 1965 and 1971. Pakistani troops fired on Indian security forces who stopped a mob of Pakistani protesters from storming across the border into disputed Kashmir, officials said today. At least three demonstrators were killed Sunday night, a Defense Ministry spokesman said in Islamabad. Pakistan's state-run TV said the Indian guards killed as many as six. The trouble started after Indian border guards opened fire on hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line separating Pakistan-controlled Kashmir from the Indian-held region. A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said Pakistani troops then fired about 200 rounds from light and medium weapons at Indian border posts in the Uri sector. Indian forces returned fire and the exchange continued for about half an hour, the spokesman said. No one was hurt. A Pakistani official in Islamabad denied the accusations. Pakistani military authorities and the Foreign Secretary are in touch with Indian authorities to remove the misunderstanding, said Additional Foreign Secretary Khalid Mahmood in Islamabad. Pakistan's top diplomat in New Delhi, Bashir Babar, was summoned to India's Foreign Ministry on Sunday and today and apprised of India's concern over the events, an Indian government spokesman said. A fluid 840-mile cease-fire line separates the Indian and Pakistani Kashmirs. Pakistan and Indian twice have gone to war over Kashmir, in 1948 and again in 1965. On Feb. 5, at least one person was killed and 12 wounded when Pakistani mobs tried to cross the cease-fire line near Jammu, 95 miles to the south. The two demonstrations at the cease-fire line were to express support for Moslem militants who are fighting for independence for the Moslem-dominated state from the predominantly Hindu India. On Sunday, the Pakistani mob retreated when soldiers of India's paramilitary border security force opened fire, said the Indian spokesman who refused to be identified. The mob returned a second time by which time it had become slightly dark, he said. That is when the Pakistani troops opened fire. A Pakistani spokesman, who also refused to be identified, said Pakistani army patrols repulsed a mob of some 1,200 demonstrators. Small groups broke away from the crowd and slipped into the Indian-held territory, he said. An official of the Indian border security force, which normally patrols the border, said the Indian army today took control of the cease-fire line. Some men in the intruding crowd were armed with guns which they fired occasionally, he said. It was becoming very difficult, our troops had to open fire, he said. Farouk Haider, vice-president of the militant Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front that is leading the uprising, said in Islamabad after the Indian firing that the situation is very confusing. Thirty-one people were wounded in the shooting, Haider said. Five were in critical condition in a hospital in Muzzafarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, he said, adding he knew of only one death. The 40-year-old conflict over Kashmir flared Jan. 20 after a government crackdown and the arrest of 250 suspected militants. Most of them were subsequently released, but the arrests sparked widespread violence. At least 85 people have been killed since the crackdown began. Most of the victims have been curfew-breaking protesters shot by security forces in Srinagar. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, has been the center of the secessionist movement that has turned violent in recent years. The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front had earlier campaigned for union with Islamic Pakistan but has in recent years demanded independence and the status of a neutral country. About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Moslems, making it the only Moslem majority state in predominantly Hindu India's 25 states. Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million population. Hindus comprise 82 percent. Troops battled mobs of Moslem separatists in the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21 people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided Sunday night, police said. Fifteen demonstrators were shot and killed Sunday, while six were fatally wounded late Saturday night, according to Mohammad Nomani, inspector general of Srinagar police. Militants defied a curfew and continued trading intermittent shots with government forces on Sunday, officials said. Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death toll was at least 30, but that figure could not be confirmed. Nomani, speaking by telephone from Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, said the fighting tapered off late Sunday afternoon as heavy rains lashed the city. But gunfire echoed through the deserted streets until evening, one resident said, requesting anonymity. They (the troops) are shooting at anything moving, he said. It is a disastrous situation out there, said Ramesh Kaul, a hotel receptionist in Srinagar. At least 47 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir state since the beginning of the year in violence triggered by Moslem militants demanding independence or union with Islamic Pakistan. The separatists, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, have often attacked government offices and police officials. The situation is tense and dangerous, the state's chief secretary, Moosa Raza, said in Jammu, the state's winter capital 95 miles south of Srinagar. Nomani said the police dispatched 25 cars with loudspeakers into the city, to appeal to people to obey the curfew. The cars were escorted by heavily armed troops from the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force, he said. A 24-hour curfew was imposed Saturday in a bid to quell escalating violence and mass anti-India demonstrations in Srinagar and nearby towns. But late Saturday, crowds defied curfew and surged into downtown Srinagar chanting Indian dogs go back! and Long live Pakistan! local reporters said. They said the paramilitary troops opened fire, killing two people instantly and injuring 14. Four of them died later. As news of the shootings spread, thousands of Moslem men poured out of their homes, the reporters said. They said protesters recited verses from the Koran, the Moslem holy book. Some took up a chant urging mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, to prepare for the final sacrifice in a showdown with India's Hindu-dominated government. Jammu-Kashmir's former state chief minister, Farooq Abdullah, issued a statement accusing authorities of letting loose a reign of terror and repression. Abdullah's Moslem-dominated National Conference Party is closely aligned with the Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi, the arch political foe of Prime Minister V.P. Singh. Abdullah's government resigned Friday to protest the appointment of Singh's nominee as the state's new governor and imposition of governor's rule which amounts to tighter federal control over the state. The curfew order was one of the first acts of the new governor, Jagmohan, a tough administrator who had cracked down on Kashmiri militants during an earlier stint as the state's governor. Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses one name, took office Friday. Parts of Kashmir region are claimed by both India and Pakistan. The dispute started when the state was partitioned between the two countries when they gained independence from Britain in 1947. Srinagar's 800,000 people are moslty Moslem, as is a majority of population in the Kashmir region. The Jammu region is predominantly Hindu. India has often accused Pakistan of aiding the Kashmiri militants, a charge Pakistan has denied. Jammu-Kashmir is the only state with a Moslem majority in predominantly Hindu India. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state population of 5 million. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880 million people, while Hindus comprise 82 percent. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Thursday accused India of waging genocide in secession-minded Kashmir and of trying to start a war with Pakistan to deflect attention. Her remarks raised tensions further between India and Pakistan, which have been feuding over Indian-controlled Kashmir. The two countries, which have fought wars over the area in 1949 and 1965, have in recent weeks again built up their military forces near the common border. India is indulging in genocide, Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight Moslem countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Islamic scholars are being killed and innocent people are being slaughtered. This is deplorable, said the prime minister. She was referring to the assassination of Maulvi Mohammad Farooq, the top Moslem cleric in Indian Kashmir. During his funeral procession Monday, Indian forces shot to death 58 people. Ms. Bhutto returned late Wednesday from visits to Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, North Yemen, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, a high-profile diplomatic offensive to drum up support for Pakistan's stand on the Kashmir issue. Hindu-dominated India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Kashmiri militants fighting for secession of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with a Moslem majority. Pakistan, which is dominated by Moslems, denies the Indian charge. Since the Indian government ordered a crackdown on the militants in late January, more than 400 people have been killed. During her trip abroad, Ms. Bhutto said all her host countries agreed that India and Pakistan needed to find a lasting political settlement of the 43-year-old dispute. However, she added, If subjected to aggression, we would have the full support of the Arab Islamic nations. Pakistan, I was assured, would never be left alone. We believe the threats to peace are grave, she said. We cannot rule out the possibility of an armed conflict, but we do not believe war is inevitable, she told reporters. Ms. Bhutto said she opposes an independent Kashmir. She said it was not envisioned when India and Pakistan gained independence in a 1947 partition. The prime minister again called for talks between Pakistan and India. She also said a neutral body should look into the charges made by both sides. India has already rejected both suggestions. Moslem extremists abducted a leading businessman and an educator Friday and threatened to kill them, a day after authorities killed six militants crossing into Pakistan for arms and training, police said. Roads were blocked around Srinagar, where the hostages were seized, and soldiers tightened security around the Kashmir Valley, where the government launched a crackdown Jan. 20 on the Moslem separatist movement. A telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24 hours of a Monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed militants. The caller claimed to speak for the Students Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Moslem state. India itself is overwhelmingly Hindu. Police sources, who demanded anonymity, and the telephone caller both identified the new kidnap victims as Vice Chancellor Mushir ul-Haq of Kashmir University and L.M. Khela, general manager of Hindustan Machine Tools Co. The caller said ul-Haq's private secretary also was being held hostage, but that could not be confirmed. Moslem separatists had warned Indian government officials to leave Jammu-Kashmir state before April or face the consequences. Police said the border violence took place in Kupwara district, where at least 20 separatists tried to sneak into neighboring Pakistan to receive military training and buy weapons. No details were available. India says Pakistan trains and arms the militants in Kashmir, at the far northern tip of India. Pakistan denies it. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the region since 1947, when both nations won independence from Britain. Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged fire for several hours today after a Pakistani soldier became the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border, officers and a western observer said. The soldier was shot in the leg Sunday at a ceasefire line, several miles from the village of Chaukothi, officials said on condition of anonymity. They said there were no reports of casualties from today's firefight at the line, which divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India. The nations have twice gone to war over the Himalayan state, in 1948 and again in 1965. The former princely state was divided between the two nations after British colonial rule ended in 1947. Relations between the neighbors have become increasingly strained since Jan. 20 when Indian troops launched a military crackdown on Moslem separatists in turbulent Jammu-Kashmir. The militants want India's only majority Moslem state to either become independent or join Pakistan. Jammu-Kashmir is an aberration in India, where 82 percent of the country's 880 million people are Hindus. The leaders of both countries have tried to soothe tempers in the dispute and have said another war over the region is unlikely. However, Pakistani forces have now sealed off the border area at Chaukothi, forbidding civilians from entering the area. The border crossing was the scene of a bloody confrontation on Feb. 11 between Indian troops and Pakistani students, who were marching in solidarity with activists in Indian-held Kashmir. Indian troops killed three students and wounded several during that confrontation, a Pakistan defence ministry spokesman said. The two armies also exchanged gunfire for about 30 minutes before calm was restored. A Paksitan army captain, who said he witnessed the firefight, said unlike the occasional shootings in the past, Indian soldiers appeared to be aiming at Pakistani troops. The western observer said Sunday's shooting of the Pakistan soldier appeared to back up that assertion. In another sign of increased tensions, Pakistani and Indian officers are no longer accompanying United Nations' military observers as they pass through the borders. It is not a normal situation, the officer said. The border is extremely tense. Pakistan officials said they were taking steps to quell what one official called war fever on the Pakistan side. We are trying to tie the people down, said Amir Alan Khan, a retired lieutenant colonel who heads Kashmir's civil defence. He said hundreds of retired soldiers have approached him to ask for orders to fight the Indian army. The bodies of four Moslems were found in a Kashmir town Monday, five days after they were kidnapped by Moslem militants agitating for secession from India. The bodies, which had bullet wounds, were found in the town of Sopore about 35 miles northwest of the Kashmir capital of Srinagar, said police officials speaking on condition of anonymity. Anonymous callers to local newspapers and news agency offices said the four were killed by the Hezbul Mujahedeen because they were police informers. The Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of more than a dozen Moslem organizations fighting for independence of the Kashmir valley from India. Police officials also reported the death of one soldier in a militant ambush of an army convoy in the district of Baramulla, northwest of Srinagar. At least three soldiers were injured, they said. The deaths raise to 630 the number of people killed since security forces began a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20. The Kashmir valley, most of which falls in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, is predominantly Moslem. Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority. Moslem militants earlier had demanded union with Pakistan, the Islamic nation on India's western border. But, of late, they have been demanding independence and the status of a neutral nation. A leader of the Moslem separatist movement in Kashmir tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker Friday but was killed in a volley of police gunfire. Tens of thousands of Moslems gathered later for the funeral. Comrades fired into the air and vowed to carry on the fight for independence from India. Ashfaq Majid Wani, 28, was a leader of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, a leading separatist group. He was the front's area commander in Srinagar. Police said he tried to throw the grenade at a police bunker in downtown Srinagar while riding by on a motor scooter. The grenade went off after officers opened fire with automatic weapons. Three other people died in the melee, the police said. Hours later, thousands of residents gathered near Wani's house in an attempt to hold a funeral procession in defiance of a government curfew. But soldiers and police prevented the procession and took Wani's body to a burial ground in a government ambulance escorted by a police jeep. Women wailed and beat their chest as Wani's body was taken out of the ambulance and placed near the grave. Men shouted: Ashfaq's blood will usher independence! A group militants fired pistols and automatic rifles in the air. Witnesses estimated the crowd at 40,000. The firing continued intermittently for more than one hour until the body wa interred at 5 p.m. We will carry forward Asfaq's mission, which was to gain independence, said one militant leader holding a Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifle. He refused to give his name. The secessionist movement has been alternately simmering and flaring since 1948, when the Hindu ruler of the old princely state of Kashmir, faced with the option of merging either with India or Islamic Pakistan, chose India. The two countries then were one year old, having been partitioned from the British colonial India.

5,d112h,"DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have been obtained by the Financial Times. Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell. This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the Maxwell family. The FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss Trust. The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price. The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the Swiss trusts. If either had a financial interest in the Swiss trusts, the purchases should have been disclosed under company law, because they were both directors of MCC. The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals. Goldman's lawyers are convinced that it acted properly. Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since Robert Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family. He said MCC share purchases had been 'going on for some time' through Yakosa. He denied that the shares were bought for Yakosa's 'own account'. He said the shares were bought for other 'foundations' and then 'held for a certain time.' He also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said. Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell. The FT has however obtained documents showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell was closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex. On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company. The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury'. Two other faxes sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the transaction, the sale of the 25m shares. The Swiss trusts bought the shares, using Goldman as broker, from two Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme) and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme). Each pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds 27.47m in total. At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds. As a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each pension fund what it was owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr Maxwell described as 'nominee' for the two pension funds. In other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be sent by Goldman back to BIT. In the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer in its account at Barclays. Goldman then levied its commission and expenses on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest account. Scots bank bows out, Page 8 Claims to Israeli shares, Page 8 Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicling the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell. Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompted Sir Nicholas to apply to the High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production. The musical tells the tycoon's life story through updated versions of familiar tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan. Now in rehearsal, the show is due to open at London's Criterion theatre on February 11. The attorney-general's move to close down a West End production before its first night is regarded as without precedent. However, it is no more unprecedented, most lawyers say, than the prospect of the Maxwell brothers having to commute to their trial at the Old Bailey past a theatre advertising the story of their father as 'the musical review that will make you laugh, sing - and be angry'. The musical, which has cost Pounds 1.1m to put on, has been produced by Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private companies. Mr Steadman indicated yesterday he intended the show to go on and that the attorney-general's application for an injunction would be contested. However, he said he was leaving matters in the hands of his lawyers. Press coverage of the late publisher since his death has already caused deep concern to the Maxwell brothers' lawyers . Mr Alun Jones QC, Kevin Maxwell's barrister, led calls for reporting restrictions to be placed on a recent High Court ruling that Robert Maxwell had been fraudulent in his dealings with shares in Berlitz, the publishing company. Turning down his request, the judge asked him: 'Is it going to be your client's defence that Mr Robert Maxwell was not guilty of misappropriation?' At that point, lawyers in court themselves fell about laughing. MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year, according to the chairman's statement released with MGN accounts yesterday. Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, two sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions. Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refused to provide MGN with information, the statement says. Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, lists a series of transactions - some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few months. He says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations, including Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, over more than Pounds 40m in transfers from MGN if the bank was aware that they were 'effected for improper purposes'. Notes to the accounts show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of Pounds 421.5m in the year to December 29 1991, including Pounds 208.6m in pension deficiencies and Pounds 122.4m in transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies. Sir Robert says that during the year there were at least 28 'unusual' payments for more than Pounds 1m from the group's bank accounts, making a total of more than Pounds 180m. 'Some may well ultimately be established to have arisen under legitimate transactions.' Nine of the payments were authorised solely by Robert Maxwell. The others were authorised mainly by Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Michael Stoney, he says. One transfer to Goldman Sachs was countersigned by Mr Ernest Burrington, former managing director, at the request of Mr Kevin Maxwell on the reported instruction of Robert Maxwell. Two authorisations were countersigned by Mr Lawrence Guest, former MGN finance director. Sir Robert says the MGN directors do not believe that either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest knew there was anything improper about these payments. With these exceptions, 'the independent directors . . . were not involved in, and did not authorise or approve any of these payments,' he says. Sir Robert says the group finance department accepted assurances from the treasury department - which was headed by Mr Stoney - about 'the nature of certain transactions' including payments to financial institutions which were recorded as deposits. 'The treasury department arranged for it to appear that sums of interest had been credited to the group in respect of those 'deposits',' he says. In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN board: Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval; Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed systems and mandates, but was not convened; The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activities. The report details a Pounds 50m loan made by Bankers Trust in London last October which appears to have been used to pay off a loan from Bankers Trust in New York to Robert Maxwell Group, parent of the Maxwell private interests, Separately, the statement highlights three transfers of more than Pounds 40m from MGN to Goldman Sachs - Pounds 11m of this was transferred on Robert Maxwell's signature to pay for previous dealings in Maxwell Communication Corporation stock. The balance was for foreign exchange trade exposures incurred by Bishopsgate Investment Trust and Robert Maxwell Group, it says. He says MGN is inquiring to see whether it can establish if Goldman Sachs was 'aware or should have been aware' that the transfers 'had been effected for improper purposes'. If so, he says 'it will be possible to seek orders against them . . . for the sums paid.' He says MGN is considering legal action against professional advisers in relation to property leases, and hopes to recover money through claims on insurance policies written on Robert Maxwell's life. ABOUT 20 banks became con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses run by Robert Maxwell several months before he died and his business empire collapsed. Their concern arose when Maxwell Communication Corporation made late payments to them, a Financial Times investigation has discovered. Yet although some banks became alarmed at the implications for the financial health of his empire, they did not discuss their concerns with each other or with authorities such as the Bank of England. Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's former finance director, has described his shock to the FT at discovering last August that MCC had failed to settle foreign currency transactions with about 20 banks on time. Starting about July 4 1991, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Maxwell and his son, Kevin, had begun to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign currencies. In these 'spot' transactions, MCC would buy a currency in one financial centre promising to make payment in another centre. On a number of occasions, MCC received the currency, but did not make the payment - thereby giving itself an unauthorised loan. Mr Brookes says about 20 banks, including Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, were involved in the flurry of foreign exchange deals. At least Dollars 100m (Pounds 55m) in unapproved credit is thought to have been raised this way. A former Maxwell employee said some appeared to have been channelled into private Maxwell businesses. One banker said attempts to raise money by making late payments in the foreign market was a relatively well-known ruse with the nickname called 'teaming and lading'. It also emerged yesterday that National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender to the Maxwell private companies, felt badly let down by Maxwell because he failed to deliver funds on time at the end of July. At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on July 10, NatWest refused Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m. NatWest was upset three weeks later when it provided funds - less than Pounds 100m - to the Maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repaid the same day, and then found that repayment was not made. NatWest was forced to convert this 'intra-day' transaction into a short-term loan, which was eventually repaid. The bank told both Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell that it was concerned that repayment had not been made, but it did not discuss the problem with other banks or with the Bank of England. Instead, it pressed on with its policy of reducing the size of its loans to the Maxwell businesses. NatWest's loans to the Maxwell empire now total Pounds 182m, half the level of two years ago. Later last year, Robert Maxwell made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund assets and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercises with US investment banks, from which tens of millions of dollars were borrowed at a high price.

THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell liked to think of himself as a 'strong ' chess player and there was always a chess set in his suite in his London headquarters. 'There is no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments,' said Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday took over the business and assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge. There may be doubts about Robert Maxwell's strength as a player but less about his enthusiasm for the game. In 1990, through The European newspaper, he sponsored a section of the World Chess championships in New York. And when Pergamon was sold to Elsevier last year Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses. Mr Pein said it had taken most of the year since Mr Maxwell's death to prise the businesses, which include Chess Monthly and Bridge Monthly from the administrators to the Maxwell empire. 'Price Waterhouse took months and months to come up with any information about the company,' said Mr Pein. Even when the new company had reached agreement to buy the business from Price Waterhouse, administrator to the public Maxwell companies they then ran into trouble with Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell businesses. Mr Pein said the new company wanted to use and pay for the premises of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge - prefabricated buildings in the village of Wheatley, Oxfordshire - until they found permanent premises. However, he said that Arthur Andersen wanted two years back rent. Despite the year of difficulties, Chess and Bridge is now set up in new premises in Euston Road, London. The company said it had the largest collection of chess and bridge books and products in the UK. Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid. The writs were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme. The trustees seek more than Dollars 100m for the sale of shares plus interest, commission charges and punitive damages from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of international equities trading. The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which were transacted through Goldman and for which the schemes were never paid. The writs allege Goldman was aware the trusts were controlled by Robert Maxwell. The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman was due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer 'with close connections to Robert Maxwell'. The writs claim that Goldman was 'competing directly with its customer, the pension fund trustee, for payment'. On April 26 1991, they say, Mr Kevin Maxwell told Mr Sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the Swiss trusts. On May 23 he told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the Maxwell family. The writs allege that after the deal was struck Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension fund administrator, told Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to BIT. The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg 'made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m shares should go'. Goldman said it had 'received no money or other benefit from these transactions other than its brokerage commissions of Pounds 110,000 which were substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties paid to the Inland Revenue of Pounds 215,000'. Mirror's flagship publication is the tabloid Daily Mirror, with sales of three million copies daily. Last month, in another money-raising move, Mr. Maxwell's Maxwell Communication Corp. sold its Pergamon Press PLC unit for #440 million. In other changes, Mr. Maxwell's son Ian, who has been appointed deputy chairman of Mirror Group, will resign from his post at Maxwell Communication, where he was joint deputy managing director. Maxwell Communication said last month that its management would be taken over by Kevin Maxwell, Ian's brother. Robert Maxwell bought Mirror Group in 1984 from Reed International PLC for #113 million. Through staff cuts and heavy spending on printing facilities, Mr. Maxwell built Mirror into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper groups. In 1990, Mirror had profit of #37.2 million, or 28.2 pence a share, on revenue of #445 million. Proceeds from the share flotation will be used to strengthen and refinance the group's balance sheet. About #210 million will be used to pay back bank loans and the rest to pay in full a loan from Robert Maxwell Holdings Ltd. Salomon Bros.

Maxwell, who put together a publishing empire following his immigration to Britain in 1940, was found dead off the coast of the Canary Islands after apparently having fallen overboard from his yacht. There are allegations that Maxwell, along with two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, and a senior executive in several Maxwell corporations, Michael Stoney, were involved in the illegal transfer of funds to help his publishing empire fend off debt. The scheme used Swiss trusts and a number of institutions, including the U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs.","Robert Maxwell has been described as the Citizen Kane of his time.

He put together and personally ran world-wide publishing empire that included Macmillan Publishing House in New York, Britain's Daily mirror, the Daily Record and the European and British Printing Company, and communications Corp., Britain's largest printing company. Improprieties have been alleged in the handling of funds which involve not only Robert Maxwell, but two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, as well as Michael Stoney, an executive in several Maxwell companies. At issue is the alleged improper transfer of funds in an attempt to handle his publishing empire's crushing debts.

6,d111h," Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- Today, the Foreign  Ministry said that control operations carried out by the  corvette Spiro against a Korean-flagged [as received] ship  fishing illegally in Argentine waters were carried out ""in  accordance with international law and in coordination with the  Foreign Ministry."" The Foreign Ministry thus approved the intervention by the  Argentine corvette when it discovered the Korean ship Chin Yuan  Hsing violating Argentine jurisdictional waters on 21 May. The Argentine Navy reported today that the corvette Spiro  stayed near the Korean ship ""given the adverse weather  conditions, and fulfilling its responsibilities of sea search  and rescue."" The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in  Argentine waters, was sunk by its own crew after failing to  answer to the Argentine ship's warnings. The crew was transferred to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was  sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking  ship. The Navy reported that around 15 nautical miles off the  coast  of Malvinas and ""in accordance with bilateral agreements with  Great Britain, the Spiro transferred assistance responsibility  to British authorities."" The Foreign Ministry said ""an understanding with the UK for  operations in cases of uninterrupted persecution of illegally  fishing ships was implemented."" The Foreign Ministry also said the policy ""is in accordance  with the growing international opinion currently giving priority  to the preservation, regulation, and the sustainable use of  marine live resources and the effective punishment of violators  of national laws on the matter."" An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment. The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill. No injuries were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Salvage efforts had been hampered by 50 mph winds. The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique. Telam did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when it went down. The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately known. The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science Foundation said in a statement released in Washington. The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near Palmer station. The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins, sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation statement said. There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings. Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife, had stopped. Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak, a foundation statement said. It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive Thursday or Friday. Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill. Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: The fuel it carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel drums so a spill is practically impossible. The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82 passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and taken to Palmer Station. The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the station, said Renerie. Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement said. Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago. Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called Lucona scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee. Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resigned Jan.19. Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian Ocean. Six sailors died. The Lucona's cargo was officially described by Proksch as for a uranium processing plant and insured for $16 million. The insurance company has never paid, claiming the cargo was only scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money. Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in Syria, the Philippines and Latin America. In several interviews, Gratz described himself as a close friend of Proksch, but when Proksch fled to escape prosecution, Gratz criticized him. Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious posts in Austria. My decision is a personal one and it is politically motivated, Gratz told the house. If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council (parliament) in such a way as is his duty. In past newspaper stories, Gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment was for a uranium processing plant. Gratz, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping Proksch in several other ways. Like Blecha, Gratz is to appear before the parliamentary investigation committee. A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said. The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28 nautical miles north of the island of Ameland. It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who was not identified. There were no casualties, he said. The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview, identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer. He did not give the ship's origin or destination. The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking in high winds. They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the sinking, the official said. A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the scene. Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland. Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany. A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday. During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck sitting upright and proud two weeks ago. Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed himself to the German people in German. I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter, he said, translating himself back into English. We found no human remains. We touched nothing and took nothing. ... The future of the Bismarck is in the hands of the German people. He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship, which sank after a battle May 27, 1941. Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire. Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece, Ballard said. It appears the crew opened it up along its entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern. Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize, he added. It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships. Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons. In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits  its sinking clearly inevitable. Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered British biplanes, it was unable to escape. Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire, Ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the Germans were giving up. Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands. The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France. He said it was in remarkably good shape, elegant, well preserved. Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ringing three-word command: Sink the Bismarck! Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived. British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might have been a German U-boat. German vessels later rescued only five more survivors. The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie. The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power. The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the vessel's crew of 1,419. The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of crucial importance. Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the property of the German people. The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg. A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the Voyage of the Damned was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane, officials said Tuesday. They're going to have to move it, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Veronica Cady. The 85-foot Ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast. It was sunk June 4, 50 years after the U.S. Coast Guard turned away the SS St. Louis as its more than 900 Jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the Holocaust. The sinking site was supposed to be near where the Coast Guard intercepted the St. Louis, whose passengers also were turned away by Cuba and forced to return to Europe. Most of the passengers later died in Nazi concentration camps. For unexplained reasons, the Ostwind was pushed off a barge about a mile north of the site, and is resting in 25 feet of water on a living reef. It was truly an incredible, incredible historic event, and suddenly  boom!  somebody made a mistake, said Mayor Abe Resnick, a Holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event. Federal and Dade County officials who allowed Resnick to sink the boat are upset about the result. They didn't even come close, complained Susan Markely, an administrator with Dade's environmental department. Coast Guard Lt. Al Crespo said the yacht is balanced on a delicate living reef, threatening damage to coral and sponges. It's also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels heading to the port of Miami and has been marked with a flashing buoy, he said. It's close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor, it could hit it, Crespo said. The Army Corps of Engineers said the Ostwind must be moved or cut to pieces by June 22. If it's not, the government will remove it and bill Resnick. Resnick blames the mistake on A.M. Daly Jr., captain of the tug that towed the yacht to where it was sunk. Daly, however, said Chris Cadley, captain of a passenger boat that accompanied him, had agreed to lead him to the site. Cadley denied that, saying he only agreed to meet Daly off the coast. Resnick said someone will have to pay. I think's that's going to end up being decided by attorneys, said Ben Mostkoff, the county's artificial reef director. The Ostwind was built at Hitler's direction, although he rarely used it. After World War II, the badly decayed boat wound up in the hands of a Jacksonville marina owner. A Florida couple said their pleasure boat was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S. Coast Guard reported Sunday. William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were weak but recovering at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo. The survivors told authorities they lost about 50 pounds each from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by telephone early Sunday. The U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Command is headquartered in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco. William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by several whales on June 15 about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica. They were large, according to Mr. Butler, Vallecillo said. But he didn't know how many whales. The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said. Vallecillo said he'd heard of boats running into marine mammals when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there are any recorded cases of whale aggression. This happened in the early morning hours with good visibility, he said. This is the first (case) I've documented. As the boat was sinking, the couple said, they grabbed fishing rods and a salt-water purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat, where they remained for the next two months, Vallecillo said. As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months, the Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit. Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times the couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down. On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making its fisheries patrol about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued the couple. They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said. Butler is an experienced sailor, he said. Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, were flying to Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunited with their parents, Vallecillo said. Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822. The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert. The Bourloti Seimaz  or Explosives Invincible  was set afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios. Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greece won independence in 1830. The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture, The Massacre of Chios, based on the raids. It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the War of Independence, Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press. Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, started querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed obstacles. He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said. When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy seabed and dozens of objects  Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls, a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church, he said. The ship was obviously crammed with loot from Chios. I think there may be gold and silver items as well, he said. I also saw what I recognized as human bones, he added. He said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet in length. According to historians, more than 1,000 people  including 400 Greek captives  were aboard the ship when Kanaris staged his attack in the early hours of June 7, 1822. The Greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of Psara, towing a boat stuffed with explosives. Its pointed bow was rammed into the mouth of a cannon on the Bourloti Seimaz and a fuse lit. The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, was killed in the blast that split the ship. Kanaris and his crew of Greeks escaped. This is a very significant, very emotive find, coming from this particular period of history, said George Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine archaeology. Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet, but he said, This is a ship that must be explored. Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap American and Turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international project. American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A & M University, working in cooperation with Turkish divers, have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast. Greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying historic wrecks scattered around the Aegean and rarely carry out excavations. Ferries are among the safest vessels afloat. But, as the tragic sinking of the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high. As ferries increase in size, so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up. The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its members, the ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety. But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety. Particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987. Unlike the Herald, the Estonia appears to have had its doors closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration. Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues. First the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered. Additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulges which project from the ship's side just above the water line. Greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks. These proposals were looked at by the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise. It calculated that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the UK ferry fleet, with a further Pounds 22m in extra annual running costs. Higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares - unwelcome to ferry operators when, on the short cross-Channel routes, they face competition from the Channel tunnel. But the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster. Second, the IMO and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulations. The IMO has been trying to move enforcement up its agenda, but it depends on the good will and professionalism of governments and shipowners. Third, the IMO should be given support by national governments in its campaign, launched yesterday, to improve crew training. Much of the regulation in recent years has concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment. Above all, if new regulation does turn out to be necessary, it must be introduced speedily. As things stand, it can take years before changes are ratified by enough governments to give them force. The European Union, which Sweden and Finland are getting ready to join, could take a lead in speeding up the process. Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector. Five (small) ferries were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register. But this figure pales into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also went down. When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean, very little attention is paid. If the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in European waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the Estonia. Two sailors were missing Monday evening after a 652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sank in rough seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod. Twenty-three crew members were rescued. The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York. They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes, Midgett said. The two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft, which was the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search planes, officials said. The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft, but it turned out to be empty. The cause of the sinking was not immediately known, officials said. The Star of Alexandria had been en route from Athens, Greece, to New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds up to 35 mph, Midgett said. The first mayday call went out at 9:05 a.m. A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130 plane from Elizabeth City, N.C., converged on the ship. The lifeboat was spotted around noon. The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish communications, Midgett said. About four hours later, they were rescued by the Ravenscraig. The Star of Alexandria was not spotted, and was presumed to be sinking or sunk, Midgett said. Visibility in the rough seas was five to eight miles Monday afternoon. The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in England. It was designed to carry bulk freight, and was owned by Caribene Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a Paris-based shipping registry. The Ravenscraig had been bound for England, but its destination after its rescue mission was not immediately known.","FBIS4-57796,AP890201-0043,AP890125-0099,AP880913-0070,AP890622-0157,AP890613-0125,AP890820-0068,AP880521-0088,FT943-178,AP890417-0189",Maritime Losses Continue.

7,d118i,"John G. Tower has fallen, but the sky has not. For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding as usual. President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic assurances of future cooperation. That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the White House. Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats. They ended up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against Tower. Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed. There will be ripples, and some of them could be wave-sized. The good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target. We've established what will be known as the Tower standards, said Sen. John Warner, R-Va. That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright. But it will be a debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that was ordained long before the Tower episode. While President Bush was unwavering in his support of Tower, he burned no bridges to congressional Democrats. He insisted that Tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice, even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed. But he didn't get nasty about it, saying there was no point in escalating the fight. That's over, he said 24 hours after the Tower defeat. That's history. And now we are going to go forward. The 53-47 vote against Tower was a setback to Bush in the sense that it always is a defeat when Congress denies a president something he wants. But this denial did not cost Bush a program, or a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters. Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon. It was a break Bush could not make with a political ally who had been after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan was elected president. Tower had not been a Reagan man  he had supported Bush for the 1980 nomination. And the Reagan White House went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any Cabinet post. After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his own loyalty, all the way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee. Tower not only shunned withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if only the Senate would let him have the job. Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national television. And when that didn't work, he offered to become the first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans proposed that he get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency. No deal. So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be rejected, the first who was a former senator. Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes. Tower did not restrain himself. Battling for the job, he said withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be damning the president's judgment. He said his nomination had been turned into a vehicle for a major presidential defeat. Tower's advocates on the Senate floor said grave constitutional issues were at stake, that the authority of the presidency was on the line, that the Senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the Tower decision. But Bush said all along that the outcome, either way, would not hurt on other issues. Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed. He told his Georgia constituents that the Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's leadership. In Washington, `triumphs' and `setbacks' are short-lived, Nunn said, and that's particularly true of the president. Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said. Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair condition, hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night. The senator is expected to make a full recovery. Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said. A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas. Thursday's surgery took approximately three hours, Habgood said. When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed. Tests of that growth showed it to contain some malignant but well differentiated cells, Habgood said. Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said. After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant. He also served as an arms negotiator for President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra investigative panel. President-elect Bush designated Tower as his defense secretary on Dec. 16. The nomination is subject to Senate approval. Defense Secretary-designate John Tower contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to reports published Saturday. Meanwhile, new questions were raised about the thoroughness of the FBI's background investigation of the embattled nominee. One newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently were overlooked in the probe. The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits, including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors. Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending, has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties. A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined on Saturday to comment on the latest reports, saying it's (the nomination) before the committee. Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, did not answer a reporter's calls Saturday. In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower said he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities in connection with his work for the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace, Inc. That statement, according to two publications, The Los Angeles Times and the Legal Times, did not square with information which Tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in June of 1987. In the divorce deposition, Tower said he went to work for British Aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nation's chief strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon, the Los Angeles Times reported. Tower told the Senate committee he worked chiefly on selling commercial aircraft to U.S. airlines and also advised the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuations. He said he earned $265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December. The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorneys that he was retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapons involved. The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the FBI, the Legal Times said. It said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly. The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently has not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower. The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said the incidents included an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair. When firemen broke into his room to remove him, he was reportedly in no condition to free himself, the Post said. The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and, two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way home from work. The youth was not seriously hurt. FBI spokesman Bill Carter refused comment on specifics of the Tower investigation, but said We will follow any lead. On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice President Dan Quayle said, I have never seen drinking being a factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine. Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was no question that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said: He is not an alcoholic. He's not had a drinking problem for years. Another victim was Dr. Nicholas Davies, president-elect of the American College of Physicians, a 60,000-member industry group, said Dr. Louis Felder, who worked with Davies at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. None of the 20 passengers or three crew members aboard Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2311 survived.; The crash followed by one day the plane-helicopter collision that killed Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and six other people.; Tower, 65, and his daughter Marian, 35, boarded the 30-passenger, turboprop Embraer 120 in Atlanta and were headed to Sea Island, off the Georgia coast, for a party in Tower's honor.; Officials said they did not know the cause of the crash. The plane was descending in clear weather, authorities said, when it went down at 2:47 p.m. about three miles northeast of the runway at the Brunswick-Glynco Jetport.; Witnesses said the plane appeared to have fallen straight from the sky.; ""It just went straight down. There was no cropping of trees,"" said Lt. Jack Hopper of the Glynn County Police Department, quoting witnesses.; ""It started in on its nose, and I knew it was in trouble,"" said James Griner, who lives a quarter-mile from the airport. ""I went to the plane, but I couldn't get to it because of the fire. . . . When I got to it, it looked compacted.""; Atlantic Southeast's senior vice president, John Beiser, said officials had no indication from the pilot that the flight was in trouble.; Donald Day, the airline's manager of consumer affairs, described the aircraft as ""extremely sophisticated and fuel-efficient, one of the backbones of our commuter fleet."" He said the plane was new and had been put in service in December.; The Brazilian-made Embraer 120 is manufactured by Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA. In 1984, an Embraer 110 Bandeirante, an earlier model of the 120, crashed in Jacksonville, Fla., killing 13 people. The Federal Aviation Administration subsequently ordered an inspection of all Embraers for possible sheared or worn rivets in the tail sections.; Tower's death prompted words of grief and praise among his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, even those who helped derail his elevation to the Cabinet in 1989.; ""I'm deeply saddened by the loss of John Tower, a tough, able friend and patriot,"" said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who broke ranks with most Democrats to support President Bush's nomination of the 24-year Senate veteran to be defense secretary. ""He was intelligent and had independence of judgment.""; Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who led the successful fight against Tower's confirmation, said: ""America had lost a patriot. . . . He fought for freedom and worked diligently to make the world more secure.""; ""It's so sad,"" Bush said. ""It is a tragic loss."" Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting. An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, like a ton of bricks and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination. The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends  not Tower alone  had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch. After meeting with staff and advisers, Combest, who worked for then-Sen. Tower in the 1970s, issued a two-sentence statement supporting his fellow Texan. As a member of Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this country's armed forces. In my judgment, John Tower will be a superb secretary of defense, the statement said. Combest spokesman Rich Adams refused to comment further, and said Combest was not available to speak to reporters. The Washington Post reported that Combest described for Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s. A congressional source was quoted as saying that Combest told the senators that Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week. Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, told the Post that Combest originally went to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol. Boyd also told the Post that a group of people drank the entire bottle of scotch, not Tower alone. That was the account Combest gave the FBI following his talk with Nunn and Warner, the newspaper said. It said that in that account, Combest said that he had only seen Tower drunk on two or three occasions. Tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively in the 1970s, but says he has reduced his intake to wine with dinner. On Sunday, he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed as defense secretary. Combest, 43, worked for Tower for seven years, 1971-1978, as a legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy. Tower served in the Senate for 24 years, deciding not to seek re-election in 1984. He was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1981 through 1984. The committee, now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject Tower's nomination. You would obviously expect Mr. Tower to say no, and he obliges: volubly and passionately. If that was all there was to ""Consequences,"" we could scan the dust jacket and invest our savings in local real estate. ""Consequences"" reads a bit like a political Stephen King story as the small senator swelled into a Beltway monster. Politics never has been for the squeamish, but the Tower controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did the senator's caperings (which mostly took place in the '70s anyway). Were the writing less stiff and the narrative technique less choppy, ""Consequences"" might have been a classic case study of late 20th-century politics out of control. Given Mr. Tower's qualifications for the job -- intelligence, patriotism and past chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee -- the nomination should have sailed through with flying colors. Instead it sank like the Bismarck. Clearly and apparently to his surprise, Mr. Tower had made many enemies since his arrival in Washington in 1961, often rubbing even supporters the wrong way. The senator from the Lone Star State could be lordly, in his English-cut suits. Once, meeting with the editors of my newspaper which had backed him strongly, he thought nothing of tilting back in his chair, crossing his tiny, well-shod feet atop the conference table. When the Tower hearings opened, all manner of accusations came to public notice. The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claimed to have seen the senator consorting with A Lady Not His Wife. It was reported that Mr. Tower had chased a secretary around his desk and had fondled women at Bergstrom Air Force Base. The second wife, whom the senator had recently divorced, possessed a repertory of tales she cheerfully volunteered. At his hotel, Mr. Tower was accorded that doubtful tribute to instant-celebrity status, the media stakeout. The nominee issued fervent denials: He drank only wine, having long since sworn off scotch; he'd never chased secretaries; his services for defense-industry clients had been proper and modest. None of the charges, at least on Mr. Tower's showing, proved to have the least substance. No use. Dirt is dirtier than purity is pure, as one of John O'Hara's characters observes. Sen. Sam Nunn, Mr. Tower's successor as Armed Services Committee chairman, seemed initially to smile on the nomination; then the rumor mill started churning and he changed fronts. While endeavoring to look statesmanlike, Sen. Nunn leaned on moderate Democrats who would otherwise have supported Tower. Sen. Nunn made the campaign personal, says Mr. Tower -- vote for me or vote for him. Most Democrats, in the end, went with Sen. Nunn. What was all this about? Morality? Mr. Tower suggests instead that Sen. Nunn, a presidential hopeful, discovered and seized an opportunity to show who was really No. 1 on national defense. Sen. Nunn had every reason to know that the moral and ethical charges leveled at Mr. Tower, and investigated exhaustively by the FBI, were flimsy. Yet he waved them about anyway. When the media retailed lurid and unsubstantiated stories, Sen. Nunn pursed his lips like a Georgia Sunday-school superintendent and suggested that a drunken Mr. Tower might accidentally press the nuclear button. ""Sam Nunn,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""used the FBI inquiries to discredit me and to strike at the president of the United States. The essential chain of good judgment and goodwill broke down during my confirmation process."" Sen. Nunn has company on Mr. Tower's dishonor roll. There is Sen. Ernest Hollings (""a study in arrogance and pomposity""), Sen. James Exon (""one of the most excessive regular boozers in the Senate"") and NBC's Andrea Mitchell (""the most viciously partisan reporter I've ever seen""), along with the Washington press corps. Sen. John Warner, a Republican, is depicted as falling all over himself to stay in good with Sen. Nunn. Mr. Tower feels, not without reason, that he was arraigned on morals charges by cynical colleagues and media personages whom no one ever mistook for Southern Baptist deacons. ""I don't so much resent my rejection by the Senate,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""as the way it was done."" ""Tower, you were lynched,"" Mike Wallace, the CBS correspondent, told him. Worse yet, the lynch mob remains at large. --- Mr. Murchison is a senior columnist for the Dallas Morning News. The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term. The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on Tower's drinking habits, behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors. It was only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate has voted to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it has done so early in a new administration. Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee. The Senate galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats as the roll was called. The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed, Quayle intoned after the vote. Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to declare her opposition. She said her most serious concerns were over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an arms control negotiator. She also expressed doubts that he would pay enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military. Tower's Republican defenders began to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat, even before the roll was called. Just moments ago I took a call from John Tower, said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. His head is high, his voice is strong, Warner said. He asked me to convey thanks  in his words  to the troops who rallied to his support. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate and President Bush. I know what's in my heart and in my mind, he told reporters. I want to directly, clearly and unambiguously say that this doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the president. Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking. There was no doubt about the outcome as the Senate went through the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours before the roll call. The last few undecided senators declared their positions. Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., said he would vote against Tower. Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said he would support the nomination. Senators from both parties credited Tower's defeat to the decision to oppose him made by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee. When he made his decision all the other Democrats wheeled in behind him, said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. With the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, If necessary, we'll come up with a (new) candidate very rapidly. Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as a replacement for Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. Scowcroft replied No when asked this morning if he was in line for the Pentagon job. It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and the national security adviser, any number of congressmen and senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on the tip of their tongue, Fitzwater said. But the time has not come, he added. The time will come as soon as the vote is completed. We will wait until then. The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and one Republican committed to vote against Tower or leaning strongly in that direction. It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats declared for Tower or leaning his way. Nevertheless, the White House said it wanted to see the nomination go all the way to a vote. Tower, meanwhile, reported for work at the Pentagon where he and his three daughters had coffee together. He then continued a review of various administration proposals. I hope and believe we can work together on important matters, Mitchell said. The tension of this issue will have no long-lasting effect on the relationship. I want to say from the bottom of my heart that I hope this will be the case. The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed was dealt a crushing blow on Wednesday as a parade of previously undecided Democratic senators announced they would vote no. Only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said he would vote yes, joining just two other Democrats who have made that decision. Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., all said they would vote against Tower. Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaves him with the clear impression that Tower's personality changes when he drinks heavily, leading to a recklessness in the social sense entirely different from his behavior when sober.","AP890316-0012,LA020489-0035,AP890105-0224,AP890211-0110,LA021189-0003,SJMN91-06097121,AP890228-0146,WSJ910213-0136,LA020189-0050,AP890309-0143",Former Texas Senator John Tower killed in plane crash.,Former Texas Senator John Tower was killed in the crash of a commuter plane off the coast of Georgia.

8,d119i,"President Bush is expected to name a female career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro, according to informed sources. The sources said Thursday it is virtually certain the appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to Mozambique. They said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office Wednesday. They also said the administration is eager to have more women in key posts. Only rarely have U.S. ambassadorships in Latin America gone to women. In choosing Ms. Wells, the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. Ms. Wells, who was born in Estonia, has no prior experience in Latin America. Her personnel record indicates she speaks Spanish. Wells' name was submitted to the White House by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the Managua post, and approval is considered 99.9 percent certain, one source said. The United States and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals since July 1988. The Sandinista government expelled then-U.S. ambassador Richard Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats on the grounds they were interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs. The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the Nicaraguan embassy here. But a new era in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations is expected to open with the inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President Daniel Ortega in elections this February. Vice President Dan Quayle and a large congressional delegation are expected to represent Bush at her inaugural. The administration has asked Congress for $300 million in assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be used for resettling Contra rebels. But the request has been stalled by Senate Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe has a greater claim on U.S. resources than Nicaragua. Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986 encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward that country. The nomination finally was approved in September 1987. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to Mozambique's Marxist government. Mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the U.S. government's list of countries under Marxist rule. The Bush administration is expected to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says. The administration had planned to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives. The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party. Mrs. Chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare. The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July 1988. At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were interfering in the country's internal affairs. The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight Nicaraguan envoys in Washington, including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann. Shlaudeman, who has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation. He retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called back to duty last fall to serve as a State Department liaison with the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, was approached by a senior State Department official weeks ago about going to Managua but said he was not interested. He told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally by President Bush. When Bush telephoned him earlier this week, Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday. In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman was the top Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President Reagan. The U.S. official said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several of his conservative allies would not assure the administration that they would not delay Wells' nomination. When Wells was nominated to be ambassador to Mozambique in late 1986, Helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11 months. They took the action as a means of expressing opposition to the Reagan administration's friendship toward Mozambique's Marxist government. With the end of the Cold War, the U.N. is playing an increasingly important role in working to resolve regional disputes. It has led efforts to end civil wars in El Salvador and Cambodia, and it also helped monitor elections in Namibia. Last Friday, during an unprecedented U.N. Security Council meeting of heads of state, President Bush reaffirmed the U.N.'s leading role in peacemaking. The assignment in India could be an important one. India and its neighbor Pakistan remain embroiled in a long, bitter feud that has the potential of becoming one of the world's few remaining nuclear standoffs. Mr. Pickering was one of President Bush's first ambassadorial appointments. He served at the U.N. during the time the administration was involved in the delicate negotiations that led to the formation of the coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf War and the U.N. sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime. But some senior State Department officials have been irritated by what they call Mr. Pickering's propensity for the media spotlight. During the 1980s, when the Reagan administration drew the line against communist-backed insurgences in Central America, Mr. Pickering played an active role in that effort as U.S. envoy to El Salvador. Mr. Perkins was the U.S. ambassador to South Africa in 1986, when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions against that nation's white-minority government to pressure it to end apartheid. Mr. Perkins, who is black, traveled widely across South Africa during this period, making sure he was seen in black townships, attending church services and funerals, as well as in white communities. Mr. Pickering, reached over the weekend, refused to comment on his future plans, and Mr. Perkins couldn't be reached. Ronald I. Spiers, a veteran U.S. diplomat, will be the new undersecretary-general for General Assembly affairs, the top-ranking American post at the world body, U.N. officials said Tuesday. Spiers was ambassador to Pakistan from 1981-83 and has served as ambassador to the Bahamas and Turkey. He replaces Joseph Verner Reed, a banker who served in the post from 1987 until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for the United States. Although Spiers' nomination as undersecretary-general for Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services had been an open secret for months, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced it was effective as of Tuesday. Spiers, 64, is a career foreign service officer, most recently serving as undersecretary of state for management since 1983. Spiers has been a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations; was director of political affairs for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; and was director of NATO Affairs for the State Department. From 1966-69, Spiers was counselor for political affairs in the U.S. Embassy in London. In 1969, he became assistant secretary of State in charge of the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. When the Bahamas became independent from Britain in 1973, Spiers became the first U.S. ambassador to that nation. He became charge d'affaires in London in 1974, and was minister of the U.S. Embassy there until 1977, when he was appointed ambassador to Turkey. In 1980 he returned to the State Department as director of Intelligence and Research, and was appointed ambassador to Pakistan in 1981. Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show. Gildenhorn, according to Senate sources, is one of several Bush ambassadorial nominees who have been rated unqualified by the American Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of former high ranking diplomats, including all living former secretaries of state. One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee. The gift was not subject to the disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act. The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for Foreign Service professionals. Gildenhorn said Friday he could not comment because he is in a confirmation process. A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an excellent candidate for an ambassadorship because of his solid background in law and management. It also cited another qualification. Mr. Gildenhorn has been a strong Republican supporter being a member of the Eagles and Team 100, the State Department said. The Republican Eagles are contributors of $10,000 or more in a single year to the Republican National Committee, while Team 100 designates people who have donated $100,000 or more. Gildenhorn's political contributions are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has set a hearing on the nomination for this week. They totaled $14,675 in 1984, $17,000 in 1985; $25,469.97 in 1986; $25,250 in 1987; $104,350 in 1988; and $11,000 this year. The total: $197,744.97. Additionally, his wife, Alma Lee, gave $20,125 over the six years, including $13,000 in 1988; his daughter, Carolyn, gave $2,000; his son, Michael, gave $4,050 and his father, Oscar Gildenhorn, gave $5,750. That brings the total contributions made by Gildenhorn and his family to the GOP to $229,669.97 since 1984. Gildenhorn gave $50,000 during the period to the Republican National Committee or to the Republican Eagles. He gave $2,500 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986 to the Fund for the American Future, a Bush political action committee and contributed the legal limit of $1,000 to the Bush campaign in 1987. Gildenhorn also gave thousands of dollars to Republican congressional candidates. Included were gifts to the campaigns of Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Bill Cohen, R-Maine; Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; John Warner, R-Va.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; and former Sen. Paula Hawkins, R-Fla. Gildenhorn, 59, is a senior partner in Brown, Gildenhorn and Jacobs, a law firm specializing in real estate. He is also president of the JBG Real Estate Associates and JBG Properties Inc. Gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the Sovran Bank here. He is a graduate of the University of Maryland and Yale University Law School. Other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the American Academy of Diplomacy include Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala, nominated as ambassador to Spain; Melvin L. Sembler, a real estate executive in Florida named to be ambassador to Australia; and Della M. Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker named to be ambassador to New Zealand. No action has been taken by the Senate on any of those nominations. According to Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who first raised the issue of political contributions, Zappala and Sembler each contributed more than $100,000 to Republican candidates and causes. Mrs. Newman served as chairman of the Washington state Bush for President committee. Ambassador David Popper, president of the Academy of Diplomacy, declined to confirm that Gildenhorn and the other three nominees had been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors. But he said the academy does offer such ratings, making its judgments based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the requirements of the job. He said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the United States abroad with dignity, respect and ability. Twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by Bush in the first six months of his administration have gone to non-professionals, many of them large contributors to Republican causes, committee sources said. Sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps with amateurs rewarded for purely political services. Political throwaways, Sarbanes calls them. I think the time has come, very frankly, to get off the money merry-go-round and ask some very difficult questions, essentially about when extensive political contributions are going to be a sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination, Sarbanes told the committee last month. It's not true in every instance, but in most of these cases you seem to have to be over the $100,000 mark in order to make the consideration list, Sarbanes said. Sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such, noting that many of them compiled distinguished records. It is not the political ambassadors that are the problem, Sarbanes said. It is ambassadors without qualifications. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might embarrass the United States because of his penchant for making gross remarks. The committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of Secchia, a former Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry executive. The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., voted present, meaning they took no position. Pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts containing the distasteful specifics of Mr. Secchia's remarks. At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast. But Pell said he was unpersuaded. Tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful diplomats, Pell said. Mr. Secchia has demonstrated that he would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to Italy. Italian friends of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their country, the chairman said. I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States, Pell said. But he said that since Secchia is the president's choice he would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it. President Bush has named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday. Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, who was recalled by Bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian elections last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Bush sent Davis back to Panama City after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by U.S. forces and installation of Guillermo Endara as president. Independent observers mostly concluded Endara had won the elections by a hefty margin. Bush named Hinton as a recess appointment because Congress is not in session. That means Hinton can serve until the end of next year before he must go before the Senate for confirmation. The appointment of the 66-year-old Hinton, with his long expierience on Latin American issues, is seen as a signal of the importance Bush is placing on restoring normal relations with Panama. Those relations steadily deteriorated after the United States indicted Noriega, once a ally particularly of the U.S. intelligence community, on drug trafficking charges in Florida. Hinton has been ambassador to Costa Rica since 1987. Before that he was ambassador to Pakistan from 1983 to 1987, and ambassador to El Salvador from 1981 to 1983. He was assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs from 1979 to 1981, and before that U.S. representative to the 12-nation European Community, headquartered in Brussels, a State Department adviser on economic affairs, and director and economic counselor of the State Department's Agency for economic Development in Chile and in Guatemala. Davis, a former State Department consultant and former ambassador to Paraguay, was sent to Panama by President Reagan in 1986. Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama, said one administration official. Officials described Hinton as an experienced Latin America hand and a good person to have in place with the volatile developments in the South American country. On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Hinton highly qualified for the post because of his wide-ranging experience and expertise in Central America. However, Mitchell said he hoped Bush would send the appointment to the Senate after Congress convenes Jan. 23 despite the nature of the recess appointment.","AP900420-0006,LA072689-0050,AP900510-0029,WSJ920203-0038,LA020389-0041,FBIS3-13911,AP890801-0134,AP890715-0076,AP890517-0106,LA020289-0065,AP900102-0114",Bush ambassadorial nominees include veteran diplomats and big campaign contributors,"Veteran diplomats nominated by Bush as ambassadors included James Lilley (China), John Negroponte (Mexico), Deane Hinton (Panama), Harry Shlaudeman (Nicaragua), Thomas Pickering (India), Wesley Egan (Jordan), and Edward Perkins (UN).

9,d115i,"Police bulldozed unstable brick and mud houses today while those left homeless by an earthquake that killed at least 749 people sought shelter and awaited government aid. Casualty reports continued to trickle in from remote parts of this Himalayan mountain kingdom as relief workers fanned out through the foothills and valleys. Sunday's pre-dawn quake struck near the India-Nepal border. Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that followed the quake. Others had cracks three feet deep or were blocked by boulders the size of houses. At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa of the Home Affairs Ministry. Dharan was hardest hit. At least 131 bodies were found in the city of 100,000. Indian officials have maintained since Monday that the death toll in their country was 200 or less, but the figure was questioned by opposition politicians, survivors and the local media, including the Times of India, a newspaper that generally supports the government. They put the India death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500. Indian officials said 200 people were injured in the quake. Nepalese officials listed 752 injured, down from their earlier estimate of 1,000. In Bhaktapur, a city of 50,000 where seven people died in the quake, 63-year-old Nhuchhe Raj Sakya said his five-story brick and mud house had nearly fallen down but that he and his family of 10 were still living in it. What else can we do? the goldsmith said. We have no tent. How can I leave my place? Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan on Tuesday and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story and five-story houses. This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal, Shrestha said as he toured the town. Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plain at the base of a steep hill. Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains. Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation. We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied (the ones remaining) are safe to live in, he said. Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes were demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors or found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth. The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts. Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's quake, and rumors of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan. The rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by word of mouth. In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousing people from their sleep. Rescuers searched through debris today for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one-third of this country's territory and parts of India, killing at least 650 people and injuring thousands. The death toll was expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawn quake on the India-Nepal border, which triggered landslides and floods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years. Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, which knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at least 3,000 people. Niranjan Thapa, Nepal's minister of state for home affairs, told a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1,000 injured. He said officials expected the numbers to climb. Indian officials reported at least 200 people dead and more than 2,000 injured, most by debris from collapsing buildings. The quake, centered almost on the India-Nepal border, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale. Indian television today showed the devastation in the Indian state of Bihar: crumbled buildings, makeshift morgues lined with rows of bodies wrapped in white shrouds, damaged hospital wards packed with survivors. Medical teams in India carried medicine and other supplies to overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for victims. But the monsoons, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually last through September, hampered relief operations. Nepal's Thapa told a news conference that the rains have been a great hindrance in carrying out rescue works. Access to some areas of this mountain country is impossible. He said 21 of the kingdom's 75 districts suffered extensive damage. The hardest hit appeared to be Dharan, a sparsely populated border region where Thapa said at least 131 people died. Bir Bahadur Shahi, secretary of the home affairs ministry, flew to eastern Nepal on Sunday. He said 50,000 to 60,000 houses were destroyed in the Dharan district alone. Ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked, Shahi said, adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stone and older houses from mud and bricks. Wooden houses were not affected, he said. Many people were given shelter in schools, guesthouses and public buildings, but most of the people do not want to leave their homes, Shahi said. He said water supplies were still adequate and there were no reports of disease breaking out. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi flew to Bihar to tour some of the hardest hit areas. The government said it would release a detailed report after he returned to the capital tonight. Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha of Nepal visited some of the victims at Bir Hospital in his capital, Katmandu. The quake roused people from their sleep in Bihar and nine other Indian states and central and eastern Nepal. It lasted about a minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour. Rail tracks sank into the soggy ground and bridges over rising rivers cracked, paralyzing train service and road travel in many parts of the devastated areas. Parts of northern Bangladesh and the capital, Dhaka, also felt the tremor. There were reports that 50 people were injured, most by jumping from their houses during the quake. Witnesses in Darbhanga, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 miles south of the epicenter, said the only warnings were hissing sounds, rattling doors and cracking windows. Women began blowing conch shells, following an ancient tradition believed to appease the weather gods. More than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga, as well as the districts of Munger and Madhubani, Indian officials said. In Madhubani, the Bhootahi Balan River jumped its banks and flooded nearly 50 villages. Officials said at least 45 people died, but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsing houses. It was the worst quake to strike the region in 38 years. A temblor rumbled through the Indian state of Assam on the India-China border in August 1950. Official accounts said more than 1,500 people died, but seismologists said their records showed 30,000 were killed. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas. Rescue workers coped with aftershocks and heavy rain today in an effort to reach remote regions of the Himalayas to help victims of an earthquake whose official death toll neared 700. Rumors predicting another large quake sent thousands of panic-stricken people fleeing from their homes in India and Nepal. Sunday's pre-dawn quake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and claimed at least 497 lives in Nepal and 200 in India, government officials said. Officials in both countries said they expected the death toll to climb when reports arrived from regions difficult to reach even in good weather. The quake injured at least 2,000 people in India and 1,000 in Nepal, officials said. In Biratnagar, a city near the Indian border 150 miles east of the Nepalese capital Katmandu, residents poured into the streets before dawn today as men ran from houses to house, shouting that a message came from Katmandu that a new quake was expected before dawn. Police in the city of 300,000 people said they received no such message. I have tried to tell them they are making a mistake, but no one will listen to me, said Dabal Singh, an inspector. Anonymous telephone calls with similar rumors roused hundreds of people in Katmandu, also before dawn. Sunday's quake was felt in the capital, but no deaths or serious damage were reported in the city. In Patna, India, thousands of people huddled in the rain in open courtyards Monday as rumors swept the city that another quake was imminent. Patna is the capital of Bihar state, the worst hit area in India. A quake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale shook eastern Nepal late Monday afternoon, but there were no immediate reports of new casualties or damage. In general, however, the intensity of aftershocks has lessened. Compared to the ones on Sunday and Monday, they have been declining, Madhav Prasad Pandy, senior seismologist at Nepal's Department of Geology, said in Katmandu. He said most aftershocks had declined to a reading of 1 on the Richter scale. Rain continued in quake-affected areas, hampering access on muddy roads already cracked by the quake. Landslides blocked many roads to devastated areas. Railroad tracks sank into the mud, and the quake also cracked bridges over rivers swollen by the monsoon. In India, the area with the greatest damage and casualties was just south of the border in Bihar, India's poorest state. News reports said 400 people died in Bihar state, double the Indian government's count. Bihar officials said the reports were exaggerated, while opposition politicians in the state accused the government of suppressing information and claimed the death toll was close to 1,500. Tremors flattened more than 25,000 houses in India, officials said, and the Bhoothai Balan River flooded nearly 50 villages in the Madhubani district. Indian army soldiers helped with relief efforts, and the navy and air force were put on alert. Nepalese soldiers, police and volunteers joined forces in the kingdom's remote mountains and valleys. Niranjan Thapa of the Home Minstry reported extensive damage in 21 of Nepal's 75 districts and at least four affected districts reported 50 or more deaths. Officials distributed 88-pound bags of rice to families in this kingdom of 17 million people. Government officials said many offers of assistance had come from abroad, but no decision had been made about whether to accept them. A U.S. Embassy official said the embassy had offered $25,000 in immediate aid but had not received a response. The quake was the worst in the region since a temblor in India's eastern state of Assam killed 1,500 people in 1950, according to official accounts. Seismologists said their records showed a death toll of at least 30,000. The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on seismographs and each number represents aa tenflod increaase in intensity. A quake of 6 on the scale is capable of causing severe damage, while one measuring 5 can cause considerable damage. Police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday to keep people from returning to homes left unsafe by an earthquake that killed at least 731 people in India and Nepal. Officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise as relief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessible since Sunday's devastating quake. Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued Tuesday, while others had 3-foot-deep cracks or were blocked by boulders the size of houses in the Himalayan mountains and valleys. At least 531 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa, additional secretary in the Home Affairs Ministry. Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan, one of the hardest-hit towns, and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story and five-story houses. This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal, Shrestha said as he toured the town. India reported an official death toll of 200, but the figure was disputed by news media and opposition politicians who put the Indian death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500. In Darbhanga, India on Tuesday, worshipers offered sweets, milk and coconuts to appease the Hindu god of destruction. Women dressed in colorful saris gathered at countryside temples in the quake-ravaged areas of eastern Bihar state to pray and present their offerings to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction in the Hindu trinity. If God is pleased, nothing will happen, said one woman, who refused to give her name. The earthquake, which struck shortly before daybreak Sunday when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale. It was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950 when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts. Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plain at the base of a steep hill. At least 131 bodies have been found in the town of 100,000. Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains. Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation. We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied (the ones remaining) are safe to live in, he said. British soldiers from a nearby Gurkha recruiting center pitched in with cranes to aid the demolition. Dharan is in the heart of regional famed for fierce Gurkha fighters who have served in the British army for more than 150 years. Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes were demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors of found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth. The hardest hit areas in India were in Bihar state just across the Nepalese border. Rescuers in army helicopters searched for survivors in Bihar's Darbhanga, Madhubani and Mungar districts. Other helicopters ferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to police trapped in the most remote regions of Bihar, India's poorest state. Heavy rains, overflowing rivers and submerged bridges and roads hampered attempts by 1,000 Indian soldiers to provide assistance. In Nepal, 88-pound bags of rice were being distributed to families affected by the quake, but officials were unable to give any figures. International agencies operating in Nepal were gearing up to contribute supplies or assistance but have not yet heard from the government on what was wanted, according to several foreign relief workers who spoke on condition of anonymity. Shrestha said the mountain kingdom had not sought foreign aid because we are still assessing the magnitude of the tragedy. Some supplies, medicine and health workers arrived in eastern Nepal on Tuesday. Donors included UNICEF and the government of Japan and Britain. Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. Two-third of the children under age of 5 suffer from malnutrition and life expectancy is 52, according to UNICEF. A nation of 17 million, Nepal has one doctor for every 22,650 people, compared with 5,000 people per doctor in India and 780 per doctor in the United States. Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's earthquake, and rumors of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan. The rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by word of mouth. In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousing people from their sleep. The parents of a Peace Corps worker learned Thursday that their son, a volunteer in Nepal, was safe following an earthquake last weekend that killed at least 750 people in that country and neighboring India. They called this morning, that's the first we had heard about anything since the quake, said Arthur Giaquinta, whose 24-year-old son, Peter, lives in a village 10 miles north of the hard-hit Dharan Bazar township. Jim Flanigan, a Peace Corps spokesman in Washington, said Peter Giaquinta was fine as far as we know. In Boston, the brother of Peace Corps volunteer Bettyjean Bouffard, 27, said Thursday she called her relatives to say she was safe. The call, said Dave Bouffard, was the first news the family had had of her safety. We're ecstatic, he said, adding that his sister had been living with a Nepalese family five miles from the earthquake epicenter. Flanigan said the Peace Corps has been able to track down all but three of the 157 volunteers in Nepal. There are no Peace Corps members in India, he said. The three, he said, are from Michigan, Wisconsin and the Philadelphia area; he declined to release their names. We have a problem with roads out, monsoon rains, Flanigan said. In the best of times, reaching some of these volunteers is several days. A strong earthquake hit the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal and parts of eastern India on Sunday morning, triggering landslides and collapsing buildings. First reports said 100 people may have died. Nepal's Department of Geology said the earthquake struck at 4:54 a.m. (7:09 p.m. EDT Saturday) and measured 5.7 on the Richter scale. The department said the quake was centered near Udayapur, a town near the Indian-Nepalese border and 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, Nepal's capital. Officials said the temblor lasted about 40 seconds. In New Delhi, the Seismologoical Observatory said the quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale. The state-run Radio Nepal said at least 27 people were killed in the towns of Bhaktapur and Dharan when they were buried by collapsing houses. Press Trust of India news agency said that in addition to 100 feared dead in India and Nepal, 1,000 people were injured in the Indian states of Bihar, Sikkim and West Bengal. A Nepalese journalist in Dharan, 130 miles southeast of Katmandu, said by telephone that 20 people have already died. A large number of injured were being taken to local hospitals and a rescue operation is under way. Men of the Royal Nepal Army, police, social workers and other local inhabitants are taking part in the rescue operation. The journalist added that 90 percent of the house of Vijapur area of Dharan collapsed. Police reported seven people died in Bhaktapur, an ancient town seven miles east of Katmandu, while 20 others suffered injuries. The quake was also felt in the Indian capital of New Delhi and Calcutta, but there was no report of any casualties. One hard-hit Indian city was Dharbhanga in Bihar state, where 14 children were believed killed when their school hostel collapsed. Dharbhanga, with a population of 200,000, is 550 miles east of New Delhi. Several homes in the residential areas of Dharbhanga have collapsed, killing an unspecified number of people. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated areas while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage. The death toll from the Himalayan earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday as rescue workers hampered by monsoon rains, aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote areas of Nepal and found more bodies. In eastern India, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks were found in the embankments of six rivers in Bihar state, and officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million people. It may be the second coming. All the rivers are in full spate, and if the embankments breach, we are in for serious problems, said Puranman Mittal, the relief commissioner in Bihar state, which suffered the most damage in India. Bihar residents ran screaming through the streets on Wednesday when a mild tremor rumbled through the area. No casualties or damage was reported, witnesses and the Seismological Observatory in New Delhi said. Residents in Dharan, the worst-hit area of Nepal, also raced from their homes Wednesday during two aftershocks, officials in Katmandu said. No further damage was reported in the city, where 100 houses collapsed during the quake. Rescue workers demolished 50 homes in Dharan on Wednesday that were severely damaged in the temblor, police inspector G. Adhikari said. We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied (the ones remaining) are to safe to live in, he said. This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal, Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha, said Tuesday after a tour of devastated areas in his nation. At least 758 people died and 950 were injured in both countries Sunday when the earthquake jolted the mountainous India-Nepal border region. It was the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since 1950, when, by official count, 1,500 people were killed in the eastern Indian state of Assam. Indian officials said Wednesday that at least 196 died in India in Sunday's disaster. Officials in Nepal said at least 562 people were killed in Nepal, including 31 people whose bodies were found in remote areas on Wednesday. In India's Bihar state, officials said the water had reached dangerous levels and was still rising in six rivers: the Ganges, the Ghagara, the Burigandak, the Bagmati, the Koshi and the Mahananada. To make matters worse, survey teams found cracks in the embankments of the six rivers, which are swollen by monsoon rains that began in late June. Engineers tried to strengthen the weakened embankments with cement, and helicopters made aerial surveys watching for ruptures. As survivors in both countries began rebuilding homes damaged or destroyed by the quake, medicine, food and financial aid began arriving from abroad. Elroy J. Carlson, an official at the U.S. Embassy in Katmandu, said the United State offered $25,000 in aid. In New Delhi, U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean presented the government with a similar amount for Indian victims. Michael Hamilton, an official at the British Embassy in Katmandu, said three medical teams had been sent to Dharan. The teams are carrying two truckloads of blood and medicine, Hamilton said. The British army also runs a military hospital in Dharan, where at least 100 people were admitted. The government hospital in Dharan treated hundreds of people injured when brick and wood houses collapsed. U.N. agencies and the Red Cross also sent medical teams to Nepal, and the government began distributing 90-pound bags of rice. The relief efforts were hampered in both countries by heavy rains which cut off communications and road links to several of the affected areas. The earthquake hit a wide area, and it is a big job to reach the remote villages. But we are trying, said Mittal, the relief official in Bihar state. An earthquake that devastated parts of Nepal and India earlier this week has killed more than 980 people, officials from the two countries said Friday. Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town, calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to earthquake victims. Hang the murderers, scores of young men chanted as they marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of Karna Hyanju, once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed Communist Party. Witnesses said Hyanju was beaten with umbrellas and sticks late Thursday afternoon, then dragged through the streets for nearly two hours before police intervened. He died Friday at the Bir hospital in Katmandu, 7 miles west of Bhaktapur. Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blankets, milk and other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters. Reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from remote parts of Nepal on Friday, and the Home Affairs Ministry updated its confirmed death toll to 704. In India, the official count rose to 277. But survivors, the news media and opposition politicians say the toll could be as high as 1,500. Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, which records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion measured by a seismograph. A reading of 6 indicates the possibility of severe damage, while 7 signifies a major quake. Dhaubanjar said he saw about 40 people rounded up by police Thursday night after Hyanju's beating death. He said many belonged to the same Communist faction that Hyanju once supported. People started beating him with umbrellas, Dhaubanjar said. There were a lot of scratches on his body, and a lot of blood. It looked like one ear was missing. Then they made a necklace of their shoes (by tying the laces together), put it around his neck and pulled him through the streets. As Hyanju's body was taken through the winding streets of Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, thousands of the town's 50,000 people jammed streets, temple steps and the balconies of brick and mud houses. Pashupati Rana, one of several Cabinet ministers who marched in the funeral procession, said several people were arrested in the killing, including the mayor, the deputy mayor and a member of the Rashtriya Panchayat, or non-partisan assembly. Rana, who is minister of local development and legislative, affairs, called Hyanju's death political murder. Hyanju served in the Panchayat from 1981 until 1986 when he lost the backing of the Communists in Bhaktapur, traditionally a leftist stronghold. The Panchayat, whose members are elected on non-party lines, was created after the late king Mahendra abolished the old Parliament and all political parties in 1960, saying a Western-style parliamentary system was not suited to his mountain kingdom. Dhaubanjar and a group of young men who gathered around him said Hyanju was perceived as a government supporter despite his previous communist leanings. A strong earthquake triggered landslides and destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border region early Sunday, killing at least 237 people and injuring more than 1,500, officials and news reports said. Seismologists said it was the deadliest earthquake to strike the Himalayan region since 1950. More than 100 people died when the quake rumbled through the eastern Indian state of Bihar, officials said. In Nepal, authorities said at least 137 people were dead. Officials in both countries predicted the death toll would rise after they received reports from remote areas which were hit harder. The tolls have come in only from urban areas, said V.K. Sharma, deputy secretary in the Bihar government. The temblor also jolted parts of northern Bangladesh and the capital of Dhaka, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Witnesses said windows and doors rattled, buildings cracked and people roused from their sleep ran screaming from their homes as objects tumbled from shelves and tables. My bed rattled, then it began swinging, said R.N. Rudra, a resident of Patna, the Bihar capital. My dogs began barking and I rushed out of the house. At least 1,000 people were injured when the quake triggered landslides and house collapses in Bihar and the surrounding states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, all heavily populated, largely agricultural areas. The quake also was felt in Sikkim and Tripura, located in the Himalayan foothills, the Press Trust of India news agency said. In Nepal, a Foreign Ministry official, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, said more than 500 people were injured and thousands of houses collapsed from the quake's impact. Most of them (were) buried alive under collapsed houses, said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the rescue operation in Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000 people about 18 miles from the Indian border. Shrestha said rescue operations were being hampered by the monsoon rains, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually last through September. Both countries were rushing emergency medical teams to the area. The Red Cross of Nepal issued urgent appeals for blood donations. In India's Bihar state, communications with Darbhanga, which appeared to be the worst-hit area, were disrupted. The Press Trust of India said a school hostel in the town collapsed, killing at least 17 children. It said more bodies were feared buried under the debris. The quake damaged most of the houses in Darbhanga, the news agency said, quoting P.K. Patnaik, the top civil administrator in the district. Deaths were also reported in the neighboring towns of Munger, Keoti and Narpatnagar. The tremor also was felt in the eastern city of Calcutta, Press Trust of India said. There were no immediate reports of casualties but residents were quoted as saying windows of several homes vibrated and doors rattled. The Seismological Observatory in New Delhi said the quake hit at 4:40 a.m. (7:10 p.m. EDT Saturday) and was centered 40 to 50 miles northeast of the town of Darbhanga in Bihar state, along the India-Nepal border. Observatory Director H.N. Srivastava said the quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale. Srivastava said the quake lasted about one minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour. Seismologists warned aftershocks could continue for days. The U.S. Geological Survey said its initial seismograph readings placed the center of the quake 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, the capital of Nepal. Geological Survey monitors in Golden, Colo., recorded the earthquake at a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the Richter scale. The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of magnitude 6 is capable of causing severe damage. Earthquakes are common in the Himalayan region. On Aug. 6 a quake of magnitude 7.3 shook the states of Assam, Manipur, West Bengal and Bihar. Four people were killed. India's worst earthquake was in 1950, when at least 30,000 people were killed in Assam state.","AP880824-0050,AP880822-0075,AP880823-0059,AP880823-0127,AP880825-0147,AP880821-0008,AP880824-0139,AP880826-0161,AP880821-0010",Strong Himalayan Quake Kills 704 in Nepal; 277 in India,"Sunday's strong, Himalayan earthquake, triggered landslides and collapsed houses.

10,d102e,"The actor who played Little Ricky on the I Love Lucy show said Wednesday he spent more time with Lucille Ball than he did with his own family in the five years he played the comedian's TV son. Miss Ball died of a ruptured aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Wednesday morning, hospital officials said. She was 77. She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so I was not shocked by her death, said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age 6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world. I'm sure all this is going to hit me a little later on. Thibodeaux grew up on the set, playing Little Ricky from 1956 until 1961 under Miss Ball's watchful eye. I think the thing I remember most about Lucy was that she was very much in control of everything, said Thibodeaux, who began playing the drums at age 2, was a professional drummer at age 4 and is now drummer with David and the Giants, a Christian rock group. He lives in Jackson with his wife, Kathy, a ballerina. Thibodeaux, 38, said he got his break in show business when big band leader Horace Heidt persuaded his father to bring him from Lafayette, La., to California for the Swift Premium Hour, a traveling radio show that led to a string of one-night stands across the country. That led to an audition for the I Love Lucy role in Hollywood. I remember Lucy saying, `that's him,' and from that time I was Little Ricky, said Thibodeaux, who then used the name Richard Keith. I signed a seven-year contract with the studio in 1956 and the first episode I was in was aired that December with Bob Hope  I just turned 6. Thibodeaux said that during the series' run he spent as much time with Miss Ball as with his own family in Lafayette. And I spent more time with her off the set at her home than at the studio, he said. I remember her as very strict but with a lot of love. She had her ways but despite all, she was a great person, very, very talented. I know everybody remembers her as zany and wacky but that was only on the show. Actually, she was just the opposite and was very serious. ... That's what made her a great actress. He said Miss Ball often gave him gifts and that he remembers spending at least one Christmas at her home. I remember she once gave me an Indian tepee, then my own dressing room, he said. She gave me bicycles and an identical set of drums. As a young girl in western New York, Lucille Ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as she dreamed of starring in movies, hometown friends recalled. She always talked about being a star, said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her. Miss Ball, born 60 miles south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug. 6, 1911, grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake. Mrs. Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as daring in many ways. She tried to get me to run off (to Broadway), Mrs. Lopus added. But I didn't have the nerve. At 15, Miss Ball worked as a barker at the amusement park, screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice. Later, she starred in high school plays and got her start in front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct Palace Theater in Jamestown. Although Miss Ball hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had no family there, she stayed in touch with friends. Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to us, said Irene Rosseti of Celoron. Mrs. Rosseti said Miss Ball recently sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary. Miss Ball regularly donated money to charities, civic events and Jamestown Community College, said Jamestown Mayor Steven Carlson. On May 20, Miss Ball was to receive an honorary degree from the college and had planned to return to Jamestown, now a city of about 40,000. Residents had put up posters saying Jamestown Loves Lucy in storefronts and home windows. After Miss Ball suffered a heart attack last week, residents decided to sign the posters and send them to her as a get-well greeting. More than 150 posters were sent with 10,000 signatures. The 77-year-old comedian died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she was recovering from last week's emergency heart surgery. It is a sad day for all of us, said Nelson Garifi, an organizer of the welcoming event. But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world. Garifi, community relations director for the community college, said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously. Future generations in Celoron will have a reminder of their famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where she grew up  it will be renamed Lucy Lane. Village officials had planned formal ceremonies renaming the street when she was due in the area next month. But it will happen anyway, John Goodell of the village's historical society said Wednesday. When the society was formed about a year ago, Goodell said: We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership. It was a check written in a very bold hand with a signature about a half inch high. Bob Thomas has covered Hollywood for The Associated Press for 45 years. Thousands of Lucille Ball's fans shed tears for the woman who made them laugh, as three cities held memorial services in which the redheaded comedian was remembered with prayers and applause. She was a whole package. There never will be another one like her. I love her, said a tearful Carol Burnett following a memorial Mass in suburban Santa Monica. More than a thousand people who packed the St. Monica's Catholic Church rose to their feet and clapped for several minutes after television minister the Rev. Robert Schuller asked them to applaud the Lord for Lucille Ball. About 1,000 people also crowded a church in New York and 200 gathered in a Chicago church. All three memorial Masses began at 8 p.m. Monday, the time Miss Ball's three most popular programs were often broadcast. The 77-year-old comedian who starred in one of television's biggest all-time hits, I Love Lucy, died here April 26 of a ruptured aorta, a major blood vessel, eight days after emergency open-heart surgery. Miss Ball, known for her honed comedic timing, wide-mouthed expressions and wacky antics, was popular among generations of fans who watched I Love Lucy as a first-run show in the '50s and in three decades of reruns. She showed her love in the only way she knew how, by making you laugh, the Rev. James Fox told those gathered for the Roman Catholic Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola in New York. Broadcaster Diane Sawyer told the crowd that the death of Miss Ball may have settled a longstanding theological debate over whether there is laughter in heaven. A God who would have created her would never let her laughter be far from Him, said Ms. Sawyer. In Chicago, the Rev. Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick Church that God gave the world talents like Miss Ball to show us life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending. She taught us that if we could love Lucy, we could love ourselves, Wall said. In announcing the services, Miss Ball's family said: Monday night was the time when most of the nation was used to being with Lucy. Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball starred, The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy, aired Monday nights. I Love Lucy had starting times on Mondays and other days. Lucille Ball gave the gift of humor which produced happiness, said Schuller at the Santa Monica service. Only God knows how many husbands and wives weren't speaking  and then Monday night rolled around. Fans lined up to get in the Santa Monica church as much as four hours early. Florists delivered arrangements including a 3-foot heart of red carnations with the words I Love Lucy written across. Hundreds of people came forward during Holy Communion to receive blessings from three priests, including a woman wearing an I Love Lucy T-shirt. I think she would have loved it very much, and she lived her life for the people who were in that room tonight, said Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Miss Ball and the late Desi Arnaz. Gary Morton, Miss Ball's husband for more than two decades, attended a private service for his wife last month. The actress' remains were buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills. Bob Hope keeps voluminous files, including the jokes he delivered and people he has performed with, and his first entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a show called G.I. Journal. I really can't remember many details about it, said Hope, who pays tribute to his frequent co-star in an NBC special Saturday night. It's called Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball. She died in April of this year. That first time together was followed by four movies, frequent visits by Hope on I Love Lucy and regular appearances by Lucy on his television shows. Lucy was a very funny woman, Hope said. Even in private she could get off a great ad lib. But it's hard to compare her with other funny women. It's like asking who's the best golfer. You have to go to the records. I don't think anyone ever had the success she had. She certainly holds the most records. A secretary dug the details of that first joint appearance out of one of two vaults where Hope keeps everything pertaining to his long comic career. There are written records of all his shows, copies of all the scripts, monologues and comic routines, audio tapes of his radio shows and thousands of other mementos. G.I. Journal was on May 4, 1945. Hope's file reads: Spot: Lucille Ball ... English play ... For Charity Bazaar. Hope and Ball had actually known each other before they began working together. In fact, the late Desi Arnaz, her then husband, worked for Hope first. He said Ball asked him nearly 50 years ago to find a place on his popular radio show for band leader Arnaz. Stan Kenton was leaving as my orchestra leader, Hope said. I gave Desi a spot on my show. We also gave him some lines to speak. Every time he walked up to the microphone he dropped an enchilada. He could hardly talk, let alone get a laugh. When they started `I Love Lucy,' I said, `What's going on? This man is funny.' The night before she died I performed at the Music Center, he said. Lucy was in the hospital and I saw her daughter, Lucie Arnaz, and said, `Isn't it wonderful she's doing better.' They called me the next day and said she had died. I said, `God has her now, but we'll have her forever.' We'll be watching her performances for a long, long time. Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucy will include clips from their movies and TV appearances, plus such guest stars as Betty White, George Burns and Danny Thomas. I'm going through everything myself picking out the clips, Hope said. The last time she was on my show was my birthday show two years ago. We sang `I Remember It Well.' Our last time together in public was at the Academy Awards in March. I think I'll do my tribute to her over a shot of that in the background. I think everyone remembers that. She was on his radio show on May 27, 1947, at Detroit. The program notes say, Lucille Ball: New York, clothes, cars, pictures. I could do a fashion show with her walking on stage, Hope said of the show clips he had been watching in preparing the special. She had great gowns and hairdos. When she performed she would use different styles. She'd change the way she read a line. She'd throw a line away one time, then she'd turn around and milk a line for laughs. Hope recalled his funny co-star in a sunny alcove in the living room of his Los Angeles home. It overlooks the one-hole golf course in the back yard, and he was attired in golfing clothes. Occasionally, he called his office in another building on the grounds to check on a piece of information. Soon after the interview, he was aboard a plane for a series of personal appearances around the country. Ball made 22 appearances on Hope's specials and he was on her shows 10 or 12 times, he said. In their first movie, Sorrowful Jones in 1949, Hope played a racetrack bookie who's forced to become the foster father of a young girl whose real father was killed by gangsters in a racehorse fix. Ball was a nightclub singer who helps him look after the girl. It was a remake of Little Miss Marker, which starred Shirley Temple in 1934. Next was Fancy Pants in 1950, a remake of Ruggles of Red Gap. Ball played a rich rancher who acquires an English butler, played by Hope. Facts of Life was in 1960, with Hope and Ball as married lovers who have a tryst. Their last film was Critic's Choice in 1963, in which Hope is a Broadway critic who has to review a play written by his wife, played by Ball. Someone reminded me the other night of a bus tour we did of movie theaters in New York to promote one our of pictures, he said. I think it was `Critic's Choice.' I found her very cooperative, very wonderful. We always had a lot of fun together. Lucille Ball, the daffy comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted viewers for four decades, died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery. She was 77. The actress, star of the hugely popular I Love Lucy and related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries, had undergone major heart surgery April 18. She had been recovering steadily, getting out of bed and joking with the staff, but shortly before dawn Wednesday, she went into cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived, said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ronald Wise. She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 a.m. and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless, Wise said. There was nothing to indicate this would happen, Wise said. The heart itself apparently was not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death. In the 6{-hour surgery at Cedars-Sinai, doctors replaced her aorta and aortic valve. Although the replaced portion of Miss Ball's aorta did not apparently fail, the entire artery was in poor condition when she was operated upon, said Dr. Robert Kass. Kass, who performed the operation, said at the time the tearing in Miss Ball's aorta progressed all the way down into her abdomen. Miss Ball, with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail, was considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format. I and 100 million others will miss her, said comedian George Burns. But we haven't lost Lucille Ball because she's still with us on television and we can see her on and on. Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter. But she also embodied an even greater treasure  the gift of love, President Bush said in a statement. She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit. She was not merely an actress or comedienne. She was Lucy and she was loved. Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution, former President and Nancy Reagan said in a statement. Just the mention of her name brings a smile. ... We love Lucy and will miss her deeply. It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 years, said Miss Ball's frequent sidekick, Gale Gordon, who was in Edmonton, Alberta. While in the hospital, the comedian was deluged with thousands of cards, letters, flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as Australia and Europe. Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in I Love Lucy from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated reruns. The late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz. Her split-second timing, wide-mouthed wails and exaggerated pratfalls made the I Love Lucy show one of the most popular in television history. Bridge clubs and bowling teams changed their meeting nights to watch Lucy and Ethel cook up still another ridiculous scheme that would push their long-suffering husbands to exasperation. Miss Ball's real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewers  more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower  tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky. The real birth occurred just four hours before the previously-filmed show was broadcast. Miss Ball's singularity as a comedian was matched by her talent as a show-business entrepreneur. She and Arnaz established one of TV's first major independent studios. Desilu, as their production company was called, made some of the top comedy shows of the 1950s and '60s, including December Bride, Our Miss Brooks and Make Room for Daddy. As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and Arnaz signed an $8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953  the largest in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch today. The couple stopped making weekly I Love Lucy shows in 1957. Despite riches and two children, Lucie and Desi Jr., their marriage foundered, and the couple divorced in 1960. In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic Gary Morton, who became her executive producer, and remained on TV for 12 more years in the weekly Here's Lucy and The Lucy Show. Miss Ball was born Aug. 6, 1911, in Jamestown, N.Y., the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist. Young Lucy, a brunette, was dazzled by the stage, but her ambitions were discouraged by an acting school  They sent my mother a letter saying she was wasting her money, Miss Ball once said  and she turned to modeling under the name Diane Belmont. Her ads for Chesterfield cigarettes caught Hollywood's eye, and in 1933 she went to California. As a blonde, she appeared with the Marx Brothers in Room Service, with Fred Astaire in Follow the Fleet and with Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in Stage Door. In all, she appeared in more than 75 movies. In 1940, her tresses colored the fiery trademark red, Miss Ball met Arnaz, a rumba star. They married within six months. In 1951, when CBS decided to move her radio series, My Favorite Husband, to television, Miss Ball insisted that Arnaz be her co-star. But the network wasn't sure Arnaz would be a hit with the American public. The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved audiences would watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born band leader with a heavy accent. They also produced their own pilot episode on borrowed money. CBS relented, and I Love Lucy was an immediate success. The show revolutionized television sitcom production in the days before videotape. It was filmed in advance before a live audience, employing three cameras instead of the traditional one used for motion pictures. The actress was last seen at the 61st Academy Awards ceremony March 29, where the svelte actress received a standing ovation and laughed freely throughout her brief bit with Bob Hope. Her last series  Life with Lucy, once again co-starring Gordon  was carried by ABC at the start of the 1986 season. But the show, her first series in 12 years, was canceled after less than two months when it drew spectacularly low ratings. She felt terrible. ... It really devastated her, daughter Lucie Arnaz said at the time. Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 TV movie Stone Pillow, considered one of the most challenging roles of her career. She was hospitalized for dehydration when it was over, but the movie was a minor critical and ratings success. Just this month, Miss Ball had signed a deal for a reported $750,000 with Putnam to publish her autobiography. Said CBS Chairman William Paley: Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS. ... Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever. Funeral arrangements were pending. An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to childhood neighbors followed the death of Lucille Ball, but many said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television reruns and her influence on comedy. The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 77 and died eight days after emergency heart surgery. A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes. God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her forever, said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope. Hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and thousands of cards after Miss Ball's death, spokesman Ron Wise said. Miss Ball's family requested that any flowers sent to the Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients. Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was critically ill. Following her operation last week, her first words to her daughter, Lucie, were: Wouldn't you know  this is the day I was going to get my hair done. Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so her death came as a shock. She had been walking, her spirits were up. Her family was with her, Wise said. She responded as well as anyone could respond to that kind of surgery. He said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden pain in her back, and in a matter of seconds went into a full cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta. Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in I Love Lucy from 1951 to 1957. In the ground-breaking show, still seen in syndication worldwide, the late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz. Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do, said actress-comedian Jane Curtin, star of the sitcom Kate and Allie. But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her shows. The show, one of the most popular in television history, was distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls. Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in comedy, recalled Joan Rivers. What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime. Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said: Lucy was great because she represented every person. She showed us human foibles and gave us a chance to laugh at ourselves. Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the I Love Lucy characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant. That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant, Miss Goldberg said. She was looking at him in a compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously. And that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy. Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of I Love Lucy on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989 appeared. I felt I had lost someone in my family. I couldn't believe it, said Rosati, 40. I was watching Lucy like I do every morning. She's one of the most-admired ladies in this town. He was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside Miss Ball's home on Roxbury Drive as florists delivered baskets of flowers to the house. Tour vans passed by in a non-stop procession. On Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flower arrangements were placed on Miss Ball's two stars  one for her film work, one for television. Budd Friedman, owner of the Improvisation comedy clubs, said, The world of comedy has lost its first lady. Her death is an irreparable loss ... to our industry. Actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series Taxi. It made it like it had been blessed, he recalled. Admirers included President Bush, in Southern California at the time of Miss Ball's passing, and former President Reagan. Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution, the former president and Nancy Reagan said in a statement. Just the mention of her name brings a smile. ... We love Lucy and will miss her deeply. Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter, Bush said. But she also embodied an even greater treasure  the gift of love. She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit. She was not merely an actress or comedienne. She was Lucy and she was loved. To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing, said Saturday Night Live comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after I Love Lucy went off the air as a regular series. She didn't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life. Said comic Tim Conway: We're going to miss this lady, but not really, because she's still here. All those wonderful things they did together ... those wonderful TV shows ... are still available. Although Miss Ball hadn't visited her hometown of Jamestown, N.Y, since 1956 and had no family there, she had stayed in touch with friends. Irene Rosseti, who now lives in Celoron, N.Y., said Miss Ball recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary. Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to us, she recalled. Lucille Ball was mourned Wednesday by the western New York hometown she left for Hollywood more than half a century ago. It is a sad day for all of us. But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world, said Nelson Garifi, organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that was to have been held next month. She was always so full of life, said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her. It seemed like she would just go on forever. The 77-year-old comedian died of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she was recovering from emergency heart surgery last week. The American Heart Association's Jamestown office was deluged with calls from Miss Ball's fans who wanted to make a memorial donation, officials said. We just can't process as many memorials as we've received, said office manager Nathan Lax. Miss Ball was born Aug. 6, 1911, in this city of 40,000 people about 60 miles south of Buffalo, the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist. She grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake. Friends said some of the characteristics of her most famous role  the zany, excitable star of television's I Love Lucy  were evident during her childhood. Mrs. Lopus said Miss Ball dreamed of fame, either as a dramatic actress in New York City or as a dancing girl in musicals. At age 15, she worked as a barker at a local amusement park, screaming pitches for popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice. In high school, she starred in high school plays and made her first appearance before a large audience at the now-defunct Palace Theater here. As a model, she caught Hollywood's eye and in 1933, she was off to Hollywood. Although the comedian hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had no family there, she regularly donated money to charities, civic events and Jamestown Community College, said Mayor Steven Carlson. Miss Ball was to have received an honorary degree from the college at the homecoming scheduled for May 20. Residents had hung posters saying Jamestown Loves Lucy in storefronts and house windows. After she fell ill last week, residents signed the posters and sent them to her as a get-well greeting. They sent more than 150 posters with 10,000 signatures. The honorary degree will be awarded posthumously, said Garifi, who is community relations director at the college. Celoron had planned to rename a street in Miss Ball's honor during her visit, and still plans to rename it as Lucy Lane, said John Goodell of Celoron's Historical Society. Goodell said that when the group was formed about a year ago, We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership. Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny. Oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face, the 83-year-old Gordon said in a telephone interview. She never saw it, but she was extremely amusing. Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend. The world will miss her greatly, the actor said. I personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the world ... a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius  the only one I've ever really known. In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon was the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in The Lucy Show from 1962-68. The next six years saw him as Harrison Carter on Here's Lucy. They were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived Life With Lucy. Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program My Favorite Husband, which later became I Love Lucy on television. I thought she was a very good-looking young woman, and very talented, he recalled. She was very pleasant to work with. None of us knew what was going to happen  television was very young then and it wasn't taken too seriously. We never dreamed it would ever become the power it was ... and the great stars it would produce. Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday, Feb. 20, when she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years. Gordon has done regular stints for years at a chain of Edmonton-based dinner theatres called Stage West. He is currently appearing with that company's Mayfair Dinner Theatre as a priest in the play Mass Appeal. The play has another month to run and Gordon says that means he won't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral. I couldn't do that because it would put people out of work, he said. She would be the first one to scream her head off if I did that.

11,d108g,"Hitting Baghdad where it hurts, more countries have joined a U.N.-sanctioned boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait. On Tuesday, countries ranging from powerful Japan to neutral Switzerland to tiny Cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort to convince the Baghdad government to withdraw its troops that invaded Kuwait on Thursday. Turkey announced it was shut down the twin Iraqi oil pipelines that run through it to the Mediterranean  carrying half of Baghdad's crude output  and cutting off trade with Iraq. Baghdad's only other major pipelines exporting crude run through Saudi Arabia, where the flow has been drastically reduced. The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted to impose broad economic sanctions against Iraq for invading small oil-rich Kuwait. The measure forbids loans to Iraq or Kuwait and prohibits any activities, including the transfer of money, that would help the two countries export their goods. Sanctions adopted by the European Economic Community on Saturday froze Iraqi assets and suspended the purchase of oil from the two Arab countries. More than 90 percent of imports from Iraq to the 12-nation EEC are petroleum products. The EEC also suspended arms sales to Iraq. Switzerland, which is not a member of the United Nations, made the unusual move Tuesday of joining the U.N. sanctions and banned all trade with Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. In addition, Switzerland prohibited all payments and other financial transfers to Iraq and Kuwait. Denmark, Norway and Sweden also announced embargoes on all trade with both countries. Japan's participation in the U.N. sanctions was seen as especially key since Tokyo usually has taken a low profile in the Middle East, which supplies much of its petroleum needs. Japan imports 99 percent of its oil. China joined the U.N. decision to embargo arms sales to Iraq, but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning the invasion. China sold arms to both Iran and Iraq during their eight-year war and is a major Iraqi trade partner. Cyprus' sacrifice in joining the embargo was to give up 70 percent of its oil imports, government spokesman Akis Fantis said. Cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of August, he said, but we are already in the process of taking steps to secure alternative sources ... The worldwide closing of ranks against Iraqi oil imports is likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices, which have already risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact on the world economy. Wholesale oil prices soared to five-year highs in New York on Monday. France will introduce controls Thursday on prices of petroleum products to prevent refiners from using Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as an excuse to raise prices, acting Premier Pierre Beregovoy announced Tuesday. An official with the Petroleum Association of Japan said he was unaware of any increase yet in the price of gasoline for consumers. The official, who refused to be further identified, said it would be at least three months before the sanctions could be expected to force higher gas prices in Japan. An Iraqi airways jet carrying 78 foreigners and a number of Iraqi citizens arrived today, the first commercial flight allowed out of Iraq since it invaded Kuwait, a Japanese Embassy spokesman said. The mostly Japanese tourists arrived at Amman airport at 6:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. EDT) along with 34 members of an Iraqi football team, said the spokesman on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately known if there were Americans on board. He said that the plane was due to leave Amman for an undisclosed destination. The spokesman said the plane was supposed to land in Vienna, but it was denied landing rights. The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted economic sanctions that ban all trade and military ties with Iraq. Jordan's information minister, Ibrahim Izzedine, said earlier today that the U.S. government had asked Jordan to facilitate the entrance from Iraq of American diplomats and their dependents. Izzedine said the request was made through the U.S. Embassy in Amman. Thousands of Westerners have been stranded in Kuwait and Iraq since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday. They include more than 350 who were on a British Airways flight that was caught in the unrest in Kuwait. A British Airways spokeswoman said today a substantial number of those passengers arrived safely in Baghdad on Monday. Among the passengers were 28 Americans, who also turned up in a Baghdad hotel and appear to be fine, a U.S. official said in Washington. In addition, a Kuwaiti businessman said about 1,000 people a day were fleeing Kuwait through the desert to Saudi Arabia. The businessman, who arrived in London on a British Airways flight from Bahrain today, said Kuwaitis and expatriates, including Westerners, were joining convoys to escape the Iraqi forces. Jordan's borders with Iraq had been closed from the Iraqi side since Thursday morning, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The provisional government of free Kuwait set up by Iraq had threatened Sunday to hold hostage citizens of countries imposing sanctions on it. A U.S. diplomat said Washington had instructed American citizens living in or visiting Iraq and Kuwait to leave when circumstances permit. Here are some quotes on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait: Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over oil production and their common border. July 17  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue. He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's economy and undermine its military buildup. July 18  Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking to wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down prices. July 20  Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors  including Kuwait  to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. July 24  The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy warships and aircraft are holding a short-notice exercise in the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait reinstates a state of alert it declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tension between the two oil-producing countries. July 25  The Iraqi government in Baghdad says that it will not be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring Kuwait, and Saddams summons the U.S. ambassador for talks. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet in Saudi Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute. July 26  OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproduction in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates pledge to abide by the agreement. Analysts say Saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the meetings. July 31  Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations meet in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to negotiate the oil and border dispute. Diplomats say Iraq has massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple the number originally estimated. That number dwarfs the Kuwaiti army, which has a total of about 20,000 troops. Aug. 1  Iraq pulls out of talks on the 2-week-old border, oil and money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends its forces to invade the oil-rich sheikdom. Aug. 2  Iraq's powerful army overruns Kuwait before dawn with tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and other government buildings. THE INVASION: Iraq's troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and government buildings 40 miles away. Early Friday, the invaders controlled Kuwait city, the capital. The soldiers were also making sweeps through the southern oilfields, according to residents and Lloyds' insurance service in London. Diplomatic sources estimate more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion. Kuwait's Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia.  THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border. Kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, has 1.9 million residents  60 percent foreigners  and an army of 20,300 soldiers.  CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil prices through overproduction. Kuwait and U.N. diplomats dismissed Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries.  REACTION: The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion. President Bush denounced it as naked agression. He froze Iraq's assets in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi imports, including oil. The order also froze Kuwait property under U.S. jurisdiction  a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it. The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales to Iraq. Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the nation had asked for American military intervention. A Pentagon source said a U.S. naval group was diverted toward the Persian Gulf. Oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion would reduce the supply of oil. Iranian editorial writers are rejoicing now that the world is waking up to one of their most hated bogeymen: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. A Monday headline: We warned you Frankenstein would torment his own creators. Saddam attacked Iran in September 1980 after a series of border skirmishes, spawning a war that dragged until an August 1988 cease-fire. The conflict has still not formally ended. Iran's late fundamentalist patriarch, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, vowed for years to unseat Saddam. Never at a loss for a vivid phrase, he compared accepting the cease-fire with Saddam to drinking poison. The status of Great Satan was reserved for the United States, the all-encompassing public enemy No. 1 for the Islamic Republic. Iran frequently accuses both the U.S. and Saddam of trying to undermine the Islamic revolution. Saddam conveniently boasts of having alone staunched the tide of radical Islam. In fact one of his reasons for invading Kuwait on Thursday, the Iraqi press noted, was its gall in demanding back tens of billions of dollars loaned to Iraq during the war Saddam says he fought for all Arabs. Over the past six months, successful U.N.-sponsored efforts toward face-to-face negotiations between Iraq and Iran robbed Iranian newspapers and television commentators of a favorite target. Saddam's overthrow of the emir of Kuwait changed all that. Old scores came brimming to the surface. Kuwait, after all, reflagged tankers in the United States during the Iran-Iraq war, ushering in the reason for the arrival of the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf in force. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency printed excerpts Mondya of an editorial from the Ettela'at newspaper that was headlined: Foster child turns rapaciously on nourisher Kuwait. It noted that Kuwait had blindly supported Iraq, little knowing that it was feeding a wild beast in her own neighborhood. Saddam has also been called generalissimo and The Invader. Under the Frankenstein headline, IRNA said in its own commentary: For the time being, tiny Kuwait ... breathes no more. With its sheikh a stateless person, and its powerful dinar which bankrolled the Iraqi military mere garbage, Kuwait is a nonentity, swallowed up by the dangerous pet it reared. Despite all the attention to the dangerous pet, the Great Satan has not been forgotton. According to Iran's pundits, the Great Satan planned it all. It wanted to get the Navy back in the Persian Gulf.","LA080290-0037,LA080290-0233,AP900808-0030,LA080690-0111,LA080890-0078,AP900807-0093,AP900802-0118,AP900803-0008,AP900802-0180,AP900807-0029","Iraq invaded Kuwait August 1990.

While the Kuwaiti emir and refugees fled to Saudi Arabia, Iraq began rounding up foreign nationals and repopulating the nation with Iraqi citizens.  Some foreigners were taken to Iraq, while some were flown to Jordan.  Reactions to the invasion have been strong. The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed trade and military sanctions and President Bush said he would defend U.S. interests.  Iran rejoiced.  Most nations are strongly enforcing these sanctions as oil prices soar and Iraq begins defensive preparations.","The Iraqi occupation of Kuwait began on August 2 when masses of combat-experienced troops poured across the border, quickly taking the country.  The Kuwait emir fled to Saudi Arabia.  The dispute began in mid-July when Iraq, a nation with 17 million, accused tiny Kuwait of stealing oil and flooding the market.  As Iraqi troops mobilized, efforts to avoid a confrontation failed.  While Iraqi said it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries, a Kuwaiti spokesman called this a false pretext.  President Bush said he would defend U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf.  Iran, which fought an 8-year war with Iraq, rejoiced that the world saw the ""Frankenstein"" created by the United States and Kuwait.  The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed trade and military sanctions against Iraq and Kuwait.  Most nations strongly enforced these sanctions, as oil prices soared.Iraq rounded-up foreign nationals in Kuwait, including passengers of a British airliner, and took many to Iraq.

12,d103g,"Iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say. The regime is very much fearful of public outrage, said Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran. They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks. As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House. Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale. Iran has told the United Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100,000. Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition. They have been very late in assisting the people, he said. Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carried signs criticizing their native country. Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake, but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's stricken residents. Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life. This regime has brought them nothing but devastation and misery. This regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home, he said. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire was declared last year after eight years of the Iran-Iraq war. Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage. The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980. The shah died in exile in July 1980, U.S. hostages were freed six months later and Khomeini died last June. Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah but had no part in organizing the Islamic republic. Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in Iran, Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated 3,000 people attending the rally. There were many, many victims before this tragedy and there are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of the United States, he said. Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through non-government groups. The State Department said Friday that Iran was willing to accept earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian organizations. An anti-American newspaper in Iran said Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake. The criminal role of America in Iran's past became evident once again in the recent earthquake, the Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Our people, even under the rubble, chant `Death to America' and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States ... even those hands stretched out to help, it said. It argued that by plundering Iran's oil and other resources for 25 years, the United States had prevented the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development projects and advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems. Even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots, halted the renovation of the country, the editorial added. The newspaper was implying that with these actions the United States had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety measures. If the United States has real humanitarian objectives and intended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing, stop hatching plots, the newspaper said. It called on Iranians to reject relief offers by the United States and other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the Iranian people. Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups. The two nations have no diplomatic ties. Countries worldwide, both friendly and hostile to Tehran's Islamic government, sent supplies, medical personnel and condolences to Iran, where about 40,000 people have died in an earthquake. Iran's deadliest earthquake since 1976 jolted the northern part of the country Thursday, devastating towns and injuring at least 100,000 people. The United States sent a message of condolence and expressed its willingness to provide humanitarian aid. Iran, which has had no diplomatic ties with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups. Moderate Arab countries with which Iran has had prickly relations  Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan  also offered their support. An official statement distributed late Friday by the Saudi Press Agency said the kingdom followed with deep sorrow the news of the tragedy. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... declares its readiness to help in extending assistance to those harmed by the tragedy, wishing to help ease the pain of the afflicted from among the sons of the Iranian Moslem nation, it said. Jordan announced Saturday it was sending medical aid to Iran, but details were not immediately clear. King Hussein sent condolences to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday in what is believed to be the first direct contact between Jordanian and Iranian heads of state in almost a decade. Jordan backed Iraq in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which ended with a cease-fire in August 1988, and at one point sent hundreds of Jordanian volunteers to fight alongside Iraqi soldiers. Egypt was sending two military planes with supplies, the Middle East News Agency reported. President Hosni Mubarak offered the aid in the framework of Egypt's concern to provide help for brothers and friends, especially at times of natural disasters. The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that a professional lifesaving team from the Armenian capital of Yerevan flew Saturday to Iran. The team gained experience in the devastating 1988 earthquake in Armenia that killed 25,000 people. Thousands of residents in the predominantly Moslem Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, which borders Iran, donated tons of flour, rice and tea, and contributed more than $500,000 to a special earthquake fund, Tass said. The Italian Red Cross sent a plane to Iran Saturday with relief supplies, including tents, blankets and medicine. In Paris, the French government, which already has sent a 200-member civil defense team  including rescuers, medical personnel and search dogs  said Saturday it would send an entire mobile hospital unit if Iran wanted it. In West Germany, the Foreign Ministry said that it was sending tents, blankets, hospital equipment and cooking equipment to Iran. Eight tons was being shipped Saturday and the government has chartered a jumbo jet to transport 100 tons of equipment Monday. At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II sent aid to earthquake victims and a message of condolence to Iranian leaders. The Vatican said in a statement that the donation of an unspecified amount was to provide for the most immediate needs of the population hurt by this huge earthquake. John Paul also sent a telegram to the papal nuncio, or diplomatic representative, in Tehran saying the pope is praying fervently for the wounded and the families of the victims. The Indian government said it would donate medicine, blankets and other relief supplies worth more than $500,000. China's Red Cross said it was sending $106,000 worth of relief supplies, state-run television said Saturday. The Polish government was sending 5 tons of powdered milk, a ton of bed sheets, a ton of medicine and 3 tons of blankets and clothing, according to Polish media reports. Malaysia was providing more than $90,000 in relief aid. Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar told reporters Saturday the money would be used to buy medicine, food, powdered milk, tents and other essential items. The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988. Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people. Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit. It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7 according to the U.S. Geological Survey. In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight. Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily. In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings. Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you, said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo. The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said. The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said. Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes. Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 years, Needham said. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas. The earthquake that devastated Iran early Thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said. Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you, said Russ Needham, a geophysist with the U.S. Geological Survey that monitors ground motion around the world. The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the people were in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo. At least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in the quake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of people in the rubble of their homes, Iranian officials said. Needham said most structures in that area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily. It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, he said of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people. A Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings. The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7. The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, he said. The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, Needhams said. Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes. Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 years, Needhams said. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas. The estimated 50,000 dead in the Iran earthquake make it the world's fourth deadliest quake in the past half-century. Here is a list of the major quakes of the past 50 years.

The Iranian President appealed for international aid from all countries except Israel and South Africa. Countries around the world, both friendly and hostile to Iran's Islamic government, responded quickly. The aid from the United States, including funds and supplies raised by Iranians in California , was channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This was a rare example of U.S.-Iranian cooperation after the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Countries as diverse as Egypt, China, India, Malaysia and the Soviet Union sent help. Even Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born author of ""Satanic Verses,"" condemned to death by the Iranian ayatollahs, contributed $8,600. All was not sweetness and light, however.

An opposition group as accused the Iranian government underestimating the number of casualties and of devoting all of its resources to a war with Iran rather than providing adequate housing.

They thought the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev, and apparently believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening everyone else, they could quickly take charge of the country.;But the people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not Gorbachev himself, but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created. For the first time in their thousand-year history, Russians asserted their independence from autocracy, and the autocrats fell.;There will be much to sort out in the months ahead. But almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the democratic revolution it tried to choke. That revolution will alter the country, creating a new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much more quickly than anyone anticipated.;Gorbachev's own standing also will be transformed by these events. It seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations -- especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule. Gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late 20th century, but this week he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin, who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him.;Yeltsin had two talents that Gorbachev lacked. One was the ability to stay close to the Russian people as their world was transformed by Gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's abysmal standing in the polls. Yeltsin's second talent was his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the Soviet Communist Party, the world from which both he and Gorbachev emerged.;Gorbachev could never shuck his party apparatchik's skin. Instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as Yeltsin has, he surrounded himself with traditional Communist Party officials and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas. Gorbachev thought Vladimir Kryuchkov of the KGB, Boris Pugo of the Ministry of Interior, Dmitri Yazov of the Red Army and Gennady Yanayev of the Communist Party were necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative forces that hated his reforms. Instead, they turned out to be mortal enemies.;If they had been only personal enemies, Gorbachev might have been undone by them. But when they closed the new, liberal news media and reverted to the Stalinist tradition of the big lie, the members of the State Emergency Committee threatened not just Gorbachev but also the new Soviet Union -- a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for dignity, self-reliance and freedom. For years, Soviets and Western Kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new Soviet Union were irreversible. Tuesday, it became clear that they were.;Of course, Gorbachev initiated those changes, and history will credit him for that. He also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend.;It is intriguing in assessing the coup's failure that men trained as thugs by some of the most violent and mean-spirited institutions created by any state could not, in their moment of truth, behave like thugs and kill their compatriots. They left Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin at large; they let the Western media report their coup as it unfolded; and they allowed foreign radio stations to broadcast news of it back into the country. Even their own news media, under strict control, conveyed the fact that there was widespread resistance to their attempted coup.;By Tuesday night, the Emergency Committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and this proved an unequal contest. As Gorbachev had previously discovered in his negotiations with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the legitimacy provided by the 50 million votes that Yeltsin received in the elections for president of the Russian federation was a formidable political force.;At first blush, the botching of the coup was surprising -- couldn't the vaunted KGB and its allies run an efficient putsch? But these were representatives of the political class that turned one of the world's richest nations into a basket case. Perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn effort to deny a truth that proved undeniable -- that the Stalinist system had failed so utterly there was simply no way to redeem it. Gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the right's impending attempt to seize power. Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup. But, incredibly, the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves.;A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the ""nightingale of the General Staff,"" published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov. With remarkable candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union. Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of Eight.;Gorbachev ignored these warnings.;To some -- an admitted minority -- the thought of a Gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of the traditional Soviet art of deception known as maskirovka. And to laymen, something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power.;The most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from Gorbachev himself, in his Thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house arrest in the Crimea.;Among the questions: If Gorbachev's 32 armed guards remained loyal to him throughout, why was there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup? Why didn't the coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or at least separate them from him?;If Gorbachev's contact with the outside world was limited to intercepting Western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio, how was he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators, down to his view of their trembling hands?;It is highly unlikely that the hard-liners had been set up or ordered by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing. Such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.;A more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev was initially a full member of the conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new Union Treaty, to have been signed last Tuesday, which provided for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics.;It is possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence.;Gorbachev did reveal, however, that two important officials had visited him in Crimea at the outset of the coup. One was head of the KGB department responsible for the security of Soviet leaders; the other was V. Boldin, Gorbachev's closest aide, by the president's own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him. One can't help but wonder whether these two visitors came to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise.;Conspiracy theorists grope for motives -- Gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his government, to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessened his powers. But there is virtually unanimous agreement on one point. Gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal mutterings about him. Cut to a row of dour Communists in ill-fitting gray suits announcing Gorbachev's illness and a palace coup. The camera zooms in on the impassive faces of the two men last seen in Gorbachev's office.;What is going on here?;OK, it's a hackneyed device that would only work in the movies. But then, this week's events in the Soviet Union have all the makings of a spy thriller.;Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories are working overtime, though they insist that their darkest imaginings be clearly labeled ""pure speculation."";""Once you have a palace coup, the possibilities are endless,"" said Robert Conquest, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution. ""Russian politics are full of very strange things."";For all we know, Conquest joked, Gorbachev could be injected with drugs to change his personality or KGB scientists could produce a body-double to impersonate him.;""His friends would know, but would you or I?"" Conquest said. ""That would be going a bit far."";A more intriguing scenario has Gorbachev conspiring with the coup plotters to engineer a transformation of the Soviet political landscape. The thinking goes like this:;With his popularity at rock bottom, Gorbachev, a lifelong creature of the KGB, hatches a false coup in order to step out of the way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other. The coup falls apart and Gorbachev triumphantly returns with a level of legitimacy he never enjoyed before.;The theory could explain the apparent bungling of the coup plotters, said author Joseph Finder, whose 1991 novel, ""The Moscow Club,"" foreshadowed many of the elements of the current crisis.;Finder, who said he did not subscribe to the scenario, nonetheless pointed out that tanks did not begin to roll until hours after Gorbachev's supposed arrest. Russian President Boris Yeltsin was not arrested, and Leningrad was left alone.;Speculation was not unique to Kremlin watchers in the United States.;Theorizing was rampant in the streets of Moscow on Tuesday, said San Francisco businesswoman Kimberly Getto, who sent a long fax detailing speculation, fueled by the fact that many of the tanks encircling the Russian parliament building had no ammunition. Gorbachev did not want bloodshed, according to the theory.;The Democratic Reform Movement, headed by former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's longtime ally, floated the same possibility in a statement Monday.;""It's highly implausible, but not to be excluded, that Gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal, thinking he'd show them they still needed him,"" said Norman Naimark, director of Stanford's Center for Russian and East European Studies. ""The degree of connivance is difficult to gauge."" At the news conference -- Gorbachev's first since the coup against him collapsed on Wednesday -- the 60-year-old leader condemned the takeover as being against ""the people, against democracy."";Earlier, he told reporters he would have killed himself rather than submit to any forced arrangement with the coup leaders. ""I said I wouldn't make any deals,"" he said then. ""Otherwise, I would have had to commit suicide."";Gorbachev detailed his purge of coup leaders, including Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov. He named a new acting KGB chief, interior minister and defense minister, and said he would do everything to ""drive out the reactionary forces from the Communist Party."";Gorbachev pledged cooperation with Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin but said he had no plans to leave the Communist Party.;""I am convinced that socialism is correct. I am an adherent of socialism."";When asked if Yeltsin now had more power than he did, Gorbachev said, ""We have been bound together by the situation."";Looking and sounding angry, he described the plotters as ""primitive and crude and crafty"" and scoffed at their announcement that he had stepped aside because he was ill. ""Their hands were shaking the whole time,"" he said derisively.;Despite his display of anger, the Soviet president said the failure of the coup could ultimately help ensure the continuation of his reforms. ""We have to see this as an enormous opportunity,"" he said.;At his news conference, Gorbachev made a point of publicly praising Yeltsin, whose folk-hero stature was enhanced during the coup as he rallied hundreds of thousands of his supporters to resist.;Before dawn today, Gorbachev flew back to Moscow from the Crimea, where he had been confined to his summer home during his brief ouster.;The Soviet president, who was reported to have slept for a few hours in his dacha outside Moscow after returning from the Crimea, arrived at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport unannounced, under heavy security. He looked somewhat disheveled, clad in a windbreaker and a shirt with open collar.;Appearing on Soviet television after his arrival, Gorbachev looked haggard and unshaven, with deep lines around his eyes and mouth. Later, at his news conference, he at first spoke haltingly, but then appeared to recover his composure and spoke in a forceful voice.;Gorbachev said his captors cut off all communication and that his only source of news during the coup had been from foreign broadcasts, including the BBC and Voice of America, received on a makeshift radio set up by his personal guards.;""This has been a very difficult, an extremely difficult lesson for me. It's my, you might say, my drama,"" he told reporters.;""Everything was done to weaken me psychologically,"" Gorbachev said. ""It was hard. It is hard to say it now, but that's how it was."";He said that early on in the coup, he tried to find out who was behind it.;""I picked up one of the telephones I have and it wasn't working. I picked up a second, a third, a fourth . . . everything was cut off,"" he said.;""Every day, morning and night, I demanded . . . that my communication be restored and that an airplane be brought immediately so I could be returned to Moscow,"" he said. He was being held at his vacation home in the Crimea.;Gorbachev said the coup leaders demanded that he resign.;""I said, 'You will never live that long (to see me resign).' "";He called the crisis ""one of the most difficult trials of the entire history"" of his six-year rule.;Gorbachev said his 32-man personal guard stayed with him throughout the coup.;The 60-year-old president said the crisis had been difficult for his family, especially his wife, Raisa, who ""took it very hard."";""Best of all, my granddaughter Anastasia didn't understand anything that was going on,"" Gorbachev told reporters. ""She wanted to go to the beach; that's all that concerned her. But the guards wouldn't let her go to the beach; they were concerned something would happen."";When it became clear the coup was failing, Gorbachev said he prepared himself and his family for the possibility that they would be killed by the conspirators.;""You know that it appeared as though they might have done something to me. They might have killed me and my whole family and made it look as if . . . they were acting in the name"" of the acting president.;""These people might have done almost anything,"" he said. Gorbachev told an audience at the Russian parliament that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover. ""They wanted to turn us into meat. They wanted to annihilate us, and for that they must bear the severe responsibility,"" the Soviet president said.;He accused the Communist Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup.

14,d106g,"The arrival Wednesday of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela prompted an outpouring of praise and encouragement from politicians and supporters. A sampling of their comments: In the 15 months since he walked free from prison, Nelson Mandela has played the chief role in talks with President F.W. de Klerk and the white government. He has presided over an African National Congress divided and not yet organized for politics. He has spent his moral capital trying, unsuccessfully, to end the murderous conflict between black political factions.; Now Mandela is confronted with his wife's conviction for a brutal criminal offense. He has loyally defended her innocence. He has seemed to hear no voice to the contrary. But events have caught up.; The radicals in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs. Mandela to arouse members against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.; There are rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to move such older leaders as Mandela and Walter Sisulu aside to a nominal senior role.; It is a gloomy picture: an elderly man bearing the hopes of peace in South Africa beset by problems, personal trauma on top of political. But I think it would be wrong to conclude that the South African drama is necessarily heading toward a tragic end.; One reason for a degree of optimism is the way South Africans on all sides, most of them, have dealt with Winnie Mandela's trial: calmly and fairly.; During the years of white supremacy the law has been viciously misused. But from all one can tell, this trial was handled professionally by the judge, Justice Michael Stegmann.; The reaction to the verdict and six-year prison sentence was also mild. Surprisingly few supporters gathered outside the court to cheer Mrs. Mandela. The ANC issued a detached statement saying that the last word had not been spoken in the case. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said ""the movement is larger than any individual.""; A more fundamental reason for hope is that F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial South Africa. They need each other. Without their agreement, there can be no solution, no outcome that leaves a viable country.; The next step is formal negotiations. They can come only when the government takes further steps to meet the reasonable ANC demand for action against violence -- in particular, a ban on the carrying of so-called ""cultural"" weapons such as spears. How can the government look away when 1,000 Zulus carrying spears and machetes slaughter township residents?; The time factor is crucial now. Negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of the public, black and white, is to retain hope for a peaceful solution. World and time press on Nelson Mandela. A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has raised objections from some faculty and students. Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring Mandela on May 13, ending a long effort by students seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony. The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner. Law students last September began a campaign of demonstrations and vigils on the campus. They hung a banner from the second floor of the law library that said: Honor Nelson Mandela. Before he was imprisoned, said third-year law student Sarah Ottinger, Nelson Mandela was an ... attorney and an activist who worked against apartheid. That's the message we wanted conveyed to students. South Africa's white-minority government says it will free Mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking political power for blacks in the country. Some faculty members and students, including many blacks, have criticized the administration's plan for the event, saying no effort was made to include them. I don't even know what office is sponsoring it, said Keith Motley, dean and director of the African-American Institute, a student group. We got a memo from the administration saying they need six ushers, but that's it. You'd think at least we'd be clued in to what's going on. This started out as something noble, something we've tried to have done for three years, said Ottinger. We are very, very sorry it happened this way. It wasn't meant to turn out like this. The trustees decided in January that Mandela should get the honorary degree. Students set up a committee to contact Mandela's family to get their approval. University spokesman Paul Jones said letters were sent to Mandela's wife, Winnie, and his two daughters: Zenani, a student at Boston University, and Makaziwe, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. However, Northeastern still has not received approval from the Mandela family, The Boston Globe reported. Unidentified assailants hurled a grenade and fired shots today at the home of relatives of Nelson Mandela, killing a baby girl and injuring her parents, police said. African National Congress officials said the dead child and her parents were distant cousins of Nelson Mandela. They denied South African police and press reports that the child was Mandela's great-granddaughter. Police said they did not know who was responsible for the attack. No group took immediate responsibility. Police Lt. Govindesamy Mariemuthoo said the attack occurred before dawn at the home of Monde Mandela in the black township of Soweto. The blast badly damaged part of the house, knocking holes in the wall and causing extensive damage. The police officer said a baby girl was killed and her parents injured. He gave no other detail on the victims. He said the room in which the injured couple had been sleeping was destroyed. ANC officials said the dead child was the great niece of Mandela's father, making her a distant cousin of Nelson Mandela. The dead girl's father, Monde Mandela, runs a small grocery shop. The ANC officials said Nelson Mandela was close to the Monde Mandela family. An ANC statement said, The ANC notes the curious coincidence of an attack on a man bearing the Mandela name at this time. Given the distant connection between Mandela and the family, police said they did not know if the attack was deliberate or just a random attack linked to the general violence. Mandela was reportedly attending a political meeting in the eastern province of Natal today. Soweto and other black townships around Johannesburg have been hit by black factional fighting that has killed about 800 people since August. The fighting has pitted followers of the ANC against Zulus of the conservative Inkatha group. Mandela has repeatedly accused security forces of manipulating the violence to derail government efforts to end apartheid and share power with the black majority. The police have denied Mandela's charges. Mandela was released in February after 27 years in jail for opposing the white minority government. He is closely guarded by ANC operatives, and there have been reports of threats on his life in recent months. Mandela and other ANC leaders have been negotiating with President F.W. de Klerk to pave the way for full-scale talks on ending apartheid, the South African system of racial separation. De Klerk has promised to end white-minority rule. Mayor David Dinkins warned Jewish groups against protesting the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New York City, saying the protests might insult the black community, a newspaper said today. The mayor also asked members of the organized Jewish community to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the visit, the Daily News said. Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, will visit eight cities from June 20 to July 1. There is a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in very, very high esteem taking great umbrage at any public protest, Dinkins said. I think it's sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very unwise, because this man is an international symbol of freedom and especially so seen by persons of color, Dinkins told the newspaper in an interview. Leaders of several Jewish-American organizations plan to meet Mandela on Sunday in Geneva. The organizations want the South African leader to clarify his position on Israel. Mandela has embraced Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in public and has compared the struggle of Palestinians to that of black South Africans. Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announced his Coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandela's public welcome in New York because of the anti-apartheid leader's unbending anti-Israel stance. City councilman Noach Dear and state assemblyman Dov Hikind said if Mandela does not make a strong statement in support of Israel, they would take out ads in newspapers and hold demonstrations. Four imprisoned African National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist said today. The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spent about six hours with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend of the Mandelas. Mandela was moved to the suburban-style home on the prison grounds Dec. 7 after recovering from tuberculosis at a private clinic in Cape Town. Mandela's wife, Winnie, said after visiting her husband last month that he is being held practically in solitary confinement at the house. The four men who visited Mandela are Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mhlangeni, Raymond Mhlaba and Ahmed Kathrada. The men were convicted along with Mandela and three others at the same trial in 1964. All were given life sentences for their activities with the ANC, the main guerrilla group attempting to overthrow the white-led government. All of them  except Sisulu  had not seen Nelson since 1986, and they were very excited at being able to spend time with him, Omar said. Of the three co-defendants not at the Dec. 23 gathering, two have been released and one remains at the Robben Island Prison near Cape Town. The Prisons Service declined to confirm or deny the visit. A representative of the African National Congress said Saturday the South African government may release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela as early as Tuesday. There are very strong rumors in South Africa today that on Nov. 15 Nelson Mandela will be released, said Yusef Saloojee, chief representative in Canada for the ANC, which is fighting to end white-minority rule in South Africa. Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jailed 27 years ago, was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the South African government. He was transferred from prison to a hospital in August for treatment of tuberculosis. Since then, it has been widely rumored Mandela will be released by Christmas in a move to win strong international support for the South African government. It will be a victory for the people of South Africa and indeed a victory for the whole of Africa, Saloojee told an audience at the University of Toronto. A South African government source last week indicated recent rumors of Mandela's impending release were orchestrated by members of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some action. And a prominent anti-apatheid activist in South Africa said there has been no indication (Mandela) would be released today or in the near future. Apartheid is South Africa's policy of racial separation. The largest family group to visit black leader Nelson Mandela since he was jailed 27 years ago gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his 71st birthday. His wife, Winnie Mandela, arrived Monday night and indicated she did not expect Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, would be freed soon. She said that opinion came from her husband, who she visited last week after Mandela's July 5 meeting with President P.W. Botha. That meeting sparked speculation that Mandela would be freed this year. He is serving a life term after being convicted of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government. Mrs. Mandela, referring to her earlier visit with her husband, told reporters: He said from that meeting with P.W. Botha we musn't construe as indicating his release. His release wasn't even there. In fact it was not on the agenda at all. Mrs. Mandela, dressed in black as an expression of mourning, spoke with reporters at the D.F. Malan Airport. She said the family normally spent Mandela's birthday at home, fasting and praying, but members would visit him this year on his birthday because he has invited us to come and share it with him. The family said 14 relatives, including children from both of Mandela's marriages, would go to Mandela's house at the Victor Verster prison farm in Paarl, north of Cape Town. In addition to Mrs. Mandela the group will include three of Mandela's children, one daughter-in-law, eight grandhildren and a great-grandson. Mrs. Mandela showed reporters a huge cardboard birthday card in the black, green and yellow colors of the outlawed African National Congress, the largest guerrilla group fighting the government. She said the card was made by members of the National Union of Mineworkers. It is very nice but it is also at the same time very sad, she said of the planned birthday celebration. After all, he is not at home. Mandela was allowed to meet last Friday with five other ANC members convicted with him in 1964 of trying to overthrow the government and still imprisoned in Cape Town, according to Dullah Omar, a family friend and attorney. Mandela has been in prison since 1962 when he was sentenced to five years for leaving the country illegally and organizing an illegal strike. He was given a life sentence following the 1964 conviction. Omar said Tuesday's family gathering will be an occasion with a strong theme of sadness because after the reunion they will leave Mr. Mandela to resume his lonely life. Mandela's oldest grandson, Mandla, 14, arrived Monday evening from Swaziland where he is a student at a private school. Mandla is the son of Makgatho Mandela, the prisoner's eldest son by his first marriage to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, who lives in the black township of Soweto and was not expected to join the reunion. Makgatho Mandela came to Cape Town with his wife, Zondi, his daughter Indaba and 4-year-old Thembela, Mandela's great-grandson. Thembela is the grandson of Tembikile Mandela. Tembikile, Mandela's son by his marriage to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, died in an automobile accident in 1970. Evelyn Ntoko Mase, the cousin of ANC leader Walter Sisulu who has been imprisoned with Mandela, married Nelson Mandela in 1944. They had four children. One of their daughters, Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, arrived with her three children from the United States, where she is studying for a doctoral degree in anthropology at Amherst College in Massachusetts. She said, He (Nelson Mandela) believes that education is the key to all doors and he would like to see all of his children get an education; in fact all of the black children ... because you cannot claim to want to rule the country and be the leaders of the future if you have people who are untrained and don't have any skills. Mrs. Mandela-Amuah said of her father's possible release, I always firmly believe that you can't predict what the South African government will do.","AP900620-0133,LA021190-0179,SJMN91-06145218,AP880508-0070,AP901006-0037,AP900609-0040,AP890118-0100,AP881113-0007,AP890717-0149,LA021190-0181",,,,,Mandela released from prison; end of apartheid in South Africa near,"Nelson Mandela spent 27 years of a life sentence in prison for conspiring tooverthrow the apartheid government of South Africa.

15,d105g," Viktor Alksnis, former USSR Supreme Soviet deputy,  today reminded us of his existence. [Correspondent Irina Zaytseva] Viktor Alksnis, born 1950,  Latvian, former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the former USSR,  soldier, resigned from the Army in order to fight for the  restoration of the USSR. During the October events he left the  White House with a head wound and was taken to hospital. After a long interval Viktor Alksnis held a news conference  today in the Slavjanskaya Hotel. He began it with a short  statement, the essence of which comes down to the fact that the  adoption of the Latvian citizenship law violates not only human  rights, but creates the conditions for a conflict similar, in  his opinion, to the ones in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. It was  not only the Latvian Government Alksnis accused of this, but  also the United States. According to him, during the latest  visit to the United States by [Latvian President] Guntis  Ulmanis, sanction was obtained for the adoption of the  aforementioned discriminatory law. [Begin Alksnis recording] And thus carte blanche was given  for mild ethnic cleansing of the Russian speaking population of  the republic. [end recording] [Zaytseva] Apart from that, Alksnis added, according to  information received from reliable sources, certain circles in  Moscow want conflict in Latvia. [Begin Alksnis recording] A certain scenario exists to drive  a so-called security corridor along the route  Daugavpils-Yekabpils-Riga where stringent ethnic cleansing of  the Latvian population will take place in reply to the mild  ethnic cleansing of the Russian population in order to bring  so-called independent Latvia to its knees. [end recording] [Zaytseva] Journalists asked for more precise information  about what Alksnis called reliable sources. [Begin Alksnis recording] You understand that I cannot name  these sources. But I can say that they are fairly  authoritative. [end recording] [Zaytseva] Asked what he intends to do, Alksnis said his  opportunities are unfortunately limited, and that is why he is  appealing to journalists. In his opinion, only joint efforts  can bring this information to the attention of world public  opinion, point out the seriousness of this issue, and avoid the  coming tragedy. Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying nationalist passions benefit opponents of his reforms. The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country, due in part to active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups. Perestroika, or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program for widespread economic and social change. State-run media also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. The six-month conflict between the two republics over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh district has led to mass rallies, strikes and ethnic violence since February. The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, intervened July 18. It rejected any change in Nagorno-Karabakh's status but called for measures to develop the region's economy and culture. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became Communist Party chief in March 1985. He indicated Friday he wants to defuse tensions between ethnic groups, but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis. Gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the Central Committee, the party's policy-making body. A summary of his remarks was distributed by the official Tass news agency. Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a current aggravation of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union, Tass said. Among the causes, Gorbachev listed a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups, inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups. Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces, he suggested increasing accountability in Soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife. Tass did not give details of Gorbachev's suggestion. At the July 18 Presidium meeting, the Soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive. Gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which says the law can punish any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt. Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on equal use of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions. In particular, the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, have demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs. The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, will face criminal charges following an incident in which activists seeking the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh attached slogans to their cars and drove around the city. The paper did not give the date or size of the mobile demonstration, but said 155 drivers have had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined. In its July 18th decision, the Presidium also ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the Caucasus Mountain region. Tass reported Friday that the situation was stabilizing in Armenia, but said that at the urging of instigators, some strikes and protests were continuing. The international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet Union. The problem is indeed a pressing one. The disputes in the Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union are causing great suffering for those involved. They are a source of legitimate concern to the Russians, who are worried by clashes close to their borders. They are concerned too about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those countries where there are conflicts, and about the economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to Russia (whose potential number is estimated at more than 2m). They believe that the problems in some of the former Soviet republics are either ignored or misunderstood. The Russians fear that if they do nothing, the conflicts will worsen and probably spread. They argue that they have a legitimate concern in trying to resolve conflicts that threaten their security. They ask why, when the international community is engaged in peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the world's trouble spots, similar efforts should not be undertaken in the hot spots near them. Equally, these disputes are of legitimate concern to Britain, its western partners and the whole international community, both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability. If uncontrolled, they pose a variety of threats to European security, including increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism. Crises in Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations with the west: unless they are carefully handled, they risk prejudicing the emerging relationship between us. The west is sometimes suspicious of Moscow's attitude. There are no differences about the need to resolve these conflicts: but there are differences over how to go about it. The British government will not underwrite Russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn into occupying forces. Nor are countries that secured their independence when the Soviet Union was dissolved keen that the west should concede to Moscow the same role it played in the Soviet empire. They fear that this would compromise their sovereignty. When they are willing for Russian troops to play a peacekeeping role, they want there to be some form of international monitoring. This has meant that, even though the west lacks the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots, it has been wary of appearing to endorse Russian involvement instead, in case it had imperial tendencies. If we are to fashion a joint approach by Russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, we must address all these concerns. Clearly Russia has an important role to play in this area. If the Russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community, the west in turn needs guarantees that Russia will not regard recognition of its involvement as giving it carte blanche in the former Soviet Union. Peace-keeping in the former Soviet Union, as indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply with internationally recognised principles. It needs to be looked at on a case by case basis. Respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount. We agreed that the principles underlying Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operations would need to include: strict respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved; an invitation from the government concerned and the consent of the parties to the conflict; commitment to a parallel political peace process; a clear mandate setting out the role of the peacekeeping forces (which should whenever possible be multinational in character); and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed. These principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the parties to the conflict, focus attention and, where possible, resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former Soviet Union. All this will help enhance Russian peacekeeping practices. Although the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the UN lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves, they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process. Extending co-operation within the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and also co-operation between Russia and Nato, might help improve training for Russian peacekeepers. This is an area we shall need to explore further. We also need to put much more emphasis on preventive diplomacy. One of the ways in which we can help prevent conflicts is to strengthen the democratic institutions in the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union. The CSCE and other international institutions can play an important role here, drawing the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on ways of promoting democratic values and principles. We discussed ways of strengthening the CSCE's role, including the role of the High Commissioner for National Minorities, at the recent Rome ministerial meeting. We must try to find ways of managing and resolving tensions before they erupt into conflict. It will not be easy, but we must try. Potentially explosive cocktails of ethnic and political animosities could spread the fire of intolerance all too easily to other countries and regions. We need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership. And we need to deal with it urgently. Our security is indivisible and we must ensure it by vigorous and imaginative efforts aimed at promoting peace for all as well as rights for all. The authors are UK foreign secretary and Russian foreign minister RUSSIA flew 3,000 special forces to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled Caucasus mountains at the weekend, its second troop deployment in a week to support a beleaguered government in its former empire. Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Spetsnaz commandos and elite police to Vladikavkaz, capital of the Russian autonomous republic of North Ossetia, 1,100 miles south of Moscow. The troops were sent to halt fighting between Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who officials claimed were setting fire to Ossetian-owned homes. Scores were reported killed and injured in street fighting between Ossetians and Ingush in the past several days. Ingush rebels were reported yesterday to have taken hostage 80 Russian interior ministry soldiers based in the region. A local official said the soldiers were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said. The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the return of lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and declared part of North Ossetia. Mr Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar held emergency meetings on the crisis on Saturday and yesterday. At the same time, the North Ossetian government said it would distribute Russian army-supplied automatic weapons to civilian volunteers. 'The Russian authorities are strong enough to make all those violating the law respect it,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's specialist on the Caucasus, told Russian television. The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed. The Central Asian nation, which has yet to form its own army since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, has also distributed weapons to civilians. On October 26-27 Russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. The Caucasus mountains, which stretch from southern Russia to the borders of Turkey and Iran, are engulfed by several conflicts. Among them are Georgia's war with Abkhazian separatists, and Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official language. The republic's parliament acted in response to a decree issued on Dec. 22 by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the official news agency Tass reported. Gorbachev also gave the republic 10 days to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measures guaranteeing equal rights for all ethnic groups within its borders. Tass said the Moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that Gorbachev said restricted the rights of minorities. Ethnic tension has gripped Moldavia, a largely agricultural republic bordering Romania, during its push for independence from the Soviet Union this year. The unrest turned violent last month, when government troops clashed with activists, leaving four dead. Gorbachev said the conflicts had reached critical levels, and he put part of the blame on the Moldavian Supreme Soviet for enacting laws that discriminate against minorities. Alarmed by rising Moldavian nationalism, two of the republic's minority groups have begun their own separatist movements. The Gagauz, a group of about 150,000 Turkish Christians, declared a new republic in southern Moldavia. In the eastern part of Moldavia, more than 300,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have joined in declaring a new republic along the Dneister River. All three groups claim discrimination by Moldavians. In particular, they resent a new law making Moldavian the official language and requiring people in dozens of jobs ranging from doctors to hairdressers to pass Moldavian language tests by 1995. Tass did not say how the Moldavian parliament would modify the law. Moldavian is identical to Romanian except for the Cyrillic script Josef Stalin imposed on the republic. It is spoken by two-thirds of the republic's residents. Soviet hard-liners want Gorbachev to impose a state of emergency and presidential rule in troubled zones throughout the ethnically and geographically diverse country. Gorbachev said the declaration of the Gagauz and Dniester republics was illegal under the Soviet and Moldavian constitutions, as were elections to form legislatures and any actions by those bodies. The Moldavian legislature has also voted to declare the elections null and void. After residents of the Gagauz region began holding local elections in late October, the Moldavian legislature clamped a two-month state of emergency on the region, restricting movement in and out of the area and banning public rallies. Volunteer brigades of college-age Moldavians, who then flocked to the region to try to stop the separatist movement, were ordered dissolved by Gorbachev's decree. The volunteers were organized by nationalist groups, including the Moldavian People's Front. A CEASEFIRE in Moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority. The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the Moldovan authorities, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr. At least nine people have been killed in clashes over the past week. As in the more severe conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the underlying tensions are growing and neither side believes it is losing. In other respects, however, the conflicts are quite different and illustrate the complexity of conflict with which the former Soviet Union is now faced. The Trans Dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh has been a source of tension between Azeris and Armenians for centuries. Moldova (formerly Moldavia) was finally taken under full Soviet control in 1944. The Soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former links with Romania - calling Moldovan a separate language from Romanian, and constructing a separate history for the Moldovan people. Industry was largely situated on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staffed by Russians and Ukrainians. Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 per cent of the population, with Moldovans accounting for 64 per cent. The little republic (4.5m people) was slow to respond to the stirrings of reform. When it did, in 1989, a language movement quickly put the hardline Communist Party on the defensive and it lost power in 1990 to the present nationalist government, headed by President Mircea Snegur, the former secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee. From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it was clear that the Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile, reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov. During the August coup last year, the Moldovan government stoutly rejected it and the Trans Dnestr authorities welcomed it, siding with the Soviet army in its brief efforts to impose military rule. Thereafter, the two sides have gathered military forces. The Trans Dnestr side has been augmented by Cossacks from nearby areas returning to their traditional role as defenders of Russia's borders. The daily Izvestia reported yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appointed themselves mercenaries for the Russians (they are paid from Rbs2,000 to Rbs5,000 a week by the Trans Dnestr authorities). TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States' defence minister, announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce. The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by Armenians. The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces. Fighting flared again yesterday in the capital Stepanakert, where the regiment is based. Azerbaijani and Armenian officials claimed their civilian targets were under particularly vicious attack. Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union. No dates have been given for the withdrawal. Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn. Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which encompasses Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered to rebuff attacks on military installations. Azeri and Armenian officials say sophisticated weapons, including combat helicopters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers, are being used by guerrillas on both sides in the four-year-old conflict. Armenian militants attacked the last Azeri stronghold in Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday, according to Azerbaijan's interior ministry, which said residents of the town of Shusha fled as helicopter gunships swooped down from snow-covered mountains. Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan will not give up any territory. Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official news agency Tass said Wednesday. Tass said 748 of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a search was continuing for a police officer who vanished June 7. No new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clashes arising from a land dispute began on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems. The argument involves allocation of land in a densly populated region where housing is scarce. It was the latest in a series of bloody civil conflicts to trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government. Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministry's Political Department, said that in two years of civil strife  mainly ethnic clashes  in the Soviet Union, about 24,000 people have been arrested. He said in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troops had to be used in 13 regions of the Soviet Union because of such outbreaks, Tass said. Grienko said 16 ministry soldiers were killed, four were reported missing and more than 1,000 wounded. Tass did not quote Grienko on how civilians casualties. The general was quoted as saying these conflicts were often accompanied by riots and pogroms, arson and massacre of innocent people, (and) complete or partial destabilization of the situation. Besides unrest this month in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence also has been reported in recent years in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan. The government has decided to give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Josef Stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years, Tass reported Wednesday. The ice has been broken. A start has been made. We're working on creating such autonomy, said Rafik Nishanov, chairman of a chamber of the Soviet legislature, in remarks carried by the official news agency. However, he said, the nuts and bolts of how to create the regions still had to be worked out. For example, a 10-year program on resettlement. People can't just be expelled from the area for others to move in. The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas. The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands, and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated. But other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged to the exiles, and re-establishing their dominion in their home regions will not be so simple. The Supreme Soviet took the basic decision that the two autonmous regions should be created on Nov. 28 but kept it quiet, apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now living in the regions. It was also a potentially dangerous precedent: The Soviet Union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic groups, and many of them have outstanding territorial claims. Trouble already has been reported between ethnic Germans and Russians in several cities on the Volga. Residents of the Saratov and Volgograd regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of the nation's estimated 2 million Germans descending on them. Ethnographers estimate there are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars in the Soviet Union, and another 1 million in Turkey. Their protests near the Kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return to their homeland were among the first tests of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promises of greater democracy. Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back to the Crimea each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return. A wave of some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrated to West Germany this year, but many would probably stay if they could be assured of their own republic, said Irina Ostroukh, a researcher at the Soviet Institute of Ethnography who studies ethnic Germans. The Nov. 28 plan approved by the Supreme Soviet recommended excluding from the German region areas where resistance to German resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts. The explosive conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the Nagorno-Karabakh region has led to 200 deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last two years. Both sides claim control over the mountainous enclave. The Supreme Soviet charged the government with creating a commmission to determine how to create the regions for the Germans and Crimean Tatars. RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow. Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia. Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilians and injured two others, underscoring the difficulties facing the operation. The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the Romanian to the Afghan borders. Reports from the former Soviet republic of Moldova said several people had been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government forces and separatists. In the Transcaucasian republic of Armenia, Radio Russia said five civilians had died overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the latest victims of a four-year undeclared war which has killed 2,000 people. Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of 'political measures and actions'. South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin. Hundreds have been killed since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians. The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet bands and matching chevrons on their sleeves. They will be joined later by a multi-ethnic force - Russians, Ukrainians, Ossetians and other mountain peoples - under the nominal command of North Ossetian leaders. The peace-keepers' mission is to form a physical barrier between the two sides, opening the way to future talks. The greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either Russian or Georgian authorities. Interfax news agency said Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, at present on a visit to Moldova, proposed a similar peace-keeping operation there.","FBIS4-40244,AP880729-0155,FT934-2439,FT924-10185,FBIS4-62505,LA070289-0167,AP901230-0022,FT921-4937,FT921-5959,AP900613-0195,AP891213-0164,FT923-13244",,,,,The collapse of the Soviet Union was accompanied by major civil unrest and ethnic conflict.,"The collapse of the Soviet Union was accompanied by major civil unrest and ethnic conflict in the former republics.

The dangerous conflicts in the former Soviet Union worried the international community. There was fear that the area would be destabilized.   By May 1994 the number killed in Tajikistan reached 100,00. The Communist Party leader said only a restored Soviet Union could deal with the ethnic fighting."
16,d104g,"The Chinese government says that 300 soldiers, thugs, bystanders and students have been killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing. But most other estimates of casualties are far higher. State Council spokesman Yuan Mu said on Tuesday that 7,000 people, including 5,000 soldiers, have been injured and 400 other soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded. Non-official sources say Yuan's figures on civilian casualties are far too low, but most have different estimates on the number of victims. They range from 500 to 12,000 people slain. In Washington, U.S. intelligence reports indicate 3,000 people probably were killed, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said estimates of the number of dead could go higher. Nearly all of the deaths and injuries occurred Saturday night and early Sunday when troops, firing randomly into large crowds, smashed through barricades to reach Tiananmen square and attack demonstrators demanding democratic reforms. One doctor said Sunday that a quick check of 10 hospitals placed the death toll at 500. Other sources, compiling various reports and surveys, estimated more than 1,000 people had been killed. That number has increased with additional details and rumors of killings. Some officials of China's Red Cross said 2,600 people were killed but Beijing's Red Cross office has refused to provide any figures. One Hong Kong newspaper reported 5,000 deaths and 30,000 injured. An Eastern European diplomat, whose country has good relations with China, insisted that 12,000 people were slain by soldiers as they attacked protesters in Tiananmen Square. That figure is certainly high. Probably fewer than 10,000 people were in the square when the troops moved in and most were able to escape unharmed. But students who had joined the Tiananmen occupation said hundreds of colleagues from the Academy of Fine Arts who were huddled around their Goddess of Democracy statue in the square were shot or crushed by tanks. Beijing University students said 150 of their fellow students who were in the square are missing. There were rumors that after the square was cleared troops burned many corpses in large bonfires and other bodies were removed by helicopters and garbage trucks to minimize the death count. Yuan's statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured were students. The exact number of people killed may never be known. Victims were taken to dozens of hospitals, clinics and homes, and there is no indication the government will reveal many details of the tragedy. And the death toll mounts. Troops manning checkpoints in central Beijing continue to fire on unfriendly crowds and victims fall. Here is a look at key events in the student pro-democracy movement that led to Sunday's assault by soldiers on protesters in Tiananmen Square: April 15  Former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang dies. Beijing University students put up posters praising him and indirectly criticizing opponents who forced his resignation after student demonstrations in 1986-87. April 17  Thousands of students march in Beijing and Shanghai, shouting Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy! April 27  More than 150,000 students, with wide support from people on the street, surge past police lines and fill Tiananmen Square, chanting slogans for democracy and freedom. April 29  Officials meet with student leaders, but independent student groups are not satisfied and continue a class boycott at 41 universities. April 30  Beijing's Communist Party chief, Zhao Ziyang, meets with student representatives. May 4  About 100,000 students and supporters march on Tiananmen Square to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's first student movement. Demonstrations are held in Shanghai, Nanjing and other cities. About 300 journalists protest outside the official Xinhua News Agency. May 9  Journalists petition the government for press freedom. May 10  Thousands of students bicycle to major media offices in a press freedom demonstration. Another protest is held in the provincial capital of Taiyuan. May 13  About 2,000 students begin a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. May 14  Thousands flock to the square to back the students. The number fasting rises to 3,000. May 15  The government deadline for students to leave the square passes. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's welcoming ceremony planned near the square must be moved to the airport. May 16  Hundreds of thousands occupy the square. Journalists and intellectuals join the protest. May 17  Zhao pleas for students to leave. Students reject his appeal and hold marches that generate 1 million supporters in Beijing. May 18  About 1 million people, including many workers, again take to the streets to show their support for the hunger strikers. Li Peng issues a stern lecture to student leaders and refuses to discuss their demands. May 19  A tearful Zhao visits weakened hunger strikers. Li also visits the students briefly. The students later decide to end the hunger strike. May 20  Martial law is declared in parts of Beijing. Zhao reportedly resigns after failing to persuade Li and other hardliners to compromise. Students resume their hunger strike, then abandon it, saying they will need their strength for the struggle ahead. May 21  Students claim to reject an order by Li Peng to leave the Tiananman Square or face military action. Defying martial law, hundreds of thousands of people remain in the square or block intersections to prevent troops from reaching it. May 22  Hundreds of thousands of people again block major roads and senior military leaders say they are resisting orders to order their troops on the protesters. At least one military convoy is reported to withdraw. May 23  One million people take to the streets to demonstrate for democracy. May 25  Li makes his first appearance since declaring martial law. State- run radio says 27 of 29 provinces support martial law, and military units announce they support martial law. May 26  Sources say Zhao and another leading liberal, Wan Li, head of the legislature, are under house arrest. May 27  Beijing student leaders propose students end their occupation of Tiananmen Square. Non-Beijing students resist and the sit-in continues. May 28  About 80,000 people, many students from outside the capital, stage a demonstration, but unlike in past rallies few workers participate. May 30  Students unveil their Goddess of Democracy, a replica of the Statue of Liberty, on the square. The government calls it an insult to the nation. Students rally outside police headquarters to protest the detention of three members of an independent labor union. May 31  The first of several pro-government rallies is staged by farmers and workers in Beijing suburbs. The participants, ordered to show up, show little enthusiasm. June 1  The Beijing Municipal Government warns foreign journalists that under martial law they must receive approval for all press coverage. Coverage of the demonstrations is banned. June 2  More than 1,000 troops appear outside the railway station in a show of force. June 3-4  Tens of thousands of troops make several attempts to move on the square but are driven back by crowds of hundreds of thousands of people supporting the students. Riot squads beat and fire tear gas at demonstrators. A final push is made the evening of June 3, and soldiers begin firing on crowds. Troops surround and enter the square June 4 in the early morning hours and thousands of protesters flee. Hundreds are wounded and many dead. Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from their communist rulers. A low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100-acre square as bonfires set during the night's confrontation continued to smolder. Hundreds of helmeted troops were deployed on the monument to revolutionary heroes in the square's center and thousands more at important intersections nearby. Tanks moved into place on what had hours earlier been a rag-tag squatter's camp of tents for the pro-democracy students. The battle for Tiananmen was primarily fought in the streets leading to the square, where scores of people fell trying to prevent columns of troops and armored military vehicles from moving on the students. Gunfire could be heard from several sides, and tracers zipped through the sky above Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum, one of the main monuments to Chinese communism in the square. Torched buses and army vehicles on the streets around Tiananmen billowed acrid smoke. Troops first entered the square from the south, when a column trotted toward the student encampment about 1 a.m. (noon EDT Saturday). They took up positions to the east after a brief skirmish involving clubs and sticks with students. More soldiers were deployed in front of the Great Hall of the People to the west, and a huge convoy with armored vehicles rolled down Changan Avenue to the north side. The few thousand students remaining in the square stayed calm as they quietly gathered on the steps of the heroes' monument. I'm not afraid, several said as the heavily armed troops encircled. Hundreds of supporters continued to mill around the square, many dressed more for a summer outing than a military battle. Loudspeakers blaring government and student announcements engaged in a noisy propaganda battle throughout the night. The government is corrupt, you've been tricked, the students roared. The state-run speaker warned that troops would use every means at their disposal to clear the square and that remaining students would bear responsibility for the consequences. At 4 a.m., the lamposts that dot the square went ominously dark, and the student loudspeaker played the Internationale, the socialist anthem. A Taiwan singer staging a hunger strike for democracy took the microphone and proclaimed: We've achieved a big victory. ... We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost too much blood. After the lights went back on a half hour later, a voice vote by the students showed most wanted to leave the square to avoid further bloodshed. They quickly filed out under the banners of their schools, carrying the quilts and padded jackets that offered warmth during the 22-day sit-in. Neither the students nor the Beijing residents who arrived to show support could control their tears. Go with us, they told their supporters, who applauded the students as they retreated. As they sobbed, many students defiantly shouted: We shall return! and flashed V-for-victory signs. Gone from Tiananmen Square are the pro-democracy banners and the tents of China's freedom movement, replaced by tanks, armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers. The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the capital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement for political change. Troops moved back their barricades, making it possible for city residents to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven weeks stood at the heart of the movement. Buses and bicyclists today were allowed to pass by Changan Avenue, which borders the north edge of the square. The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy, a 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, was taken by a tread-wheeled armored personnel carrier. When students built the statue last week, for a few days it became a symbol of the movement for democratic reforms and an end to official corruption. On Sunday morning, a tank crushed it. In all, 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel carriers lined the northern part of the square. The Monument to Revolutionary Martyrs, where the students took a final stand early Sunday, was swept clean. Poems and posters calling for a more open China have disappeared from its sides. Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and 60,000 injured over the weekend, citing a Chinese students' organization, the Union of Chinese Students in West Germany. The government says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed; diplomats and Chinese say up to 3,000 died. Soldiers drilled in Tiananmen's center, their cadenced shouting echoing around the vast expanse. A crowd of officials stood on the roof of the Great Hall of the People, overlooking the square. From this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant mass of demonstrators enveloped 5,000 troops and blocked their entry to the square. Inside the square, soldiers could be seen shuffling about, their uniformed jackets stripped off, wash basins in hand. There was a relaxed air of the inside of an army barracks as unarmed troops carried food and walked slowly together, talking and laughing in groups. The area once housing students' tents has become a holding area for a huge fleet of troop trucks. On the southern perimeter, a single line of tanks and a cordon of soldiers blocked the square from the thousands of bicylists who pedaled slowly by, peering into Tiananmen. Near the square, troops placed barbed wire in front of one street. Soldiers were billeted in a construction site, their laundered fatigues drying on the scaffolding. Next door, troops, their assault rifles slung nonchalantly over their shoulders, stood and chatted outside a discotheque. They look like they , said one local resident. I hope they know that we still don't want them here. Here is a chronology of events that began Saturday in Tiananmen Square: 1 a.m. Saturday (12 noon EDT Friday)  Tens of thousands of troops enter Beijing from the east marching toward Tiananmen Square, China's symbolic political heart. Military units also seen approaching from the west and the north. 2 a.m.  The main body of troops is stopped several hundred yards east of the vast square by thousands of people. 2 a.m. to 9 a.m.  Troops straggle away from their positions near the square, walking in small groups followed by watchful residents. 12 noon  Two truckloads of People's Armed Police attack crowds outside Beijing Hotel east of the square and up to 30 people injured. 2 p.m.  About 5,000 troops emerge from Great Hall of the People on the western side of the square and are surrounded by crowds. People's Armed Police fire tear gas and use clubs to beat protesters west of the square in a 30-minute attack. 4:30 p.m.  Stone- and bottle-throwing demonstrators skirmish with troops outside the Great Hall. Troops swinging belts attack crowds. Some soldiers injured by flying debris. 6 p.m.  Thousands of residents surround two troop convoys on a main highway in northeastern Beijing. 7 p.m.  National television repeats martial law regulations and warns people to stay off the streets and away from Tiananmen Square. 8:30 p.m.  Troops retreat into the Great Hall. 9 p.m.  More than 20,000 people block a 26-truck convoy about 2{ miles east of the square and thousands of others converge on the square to protect students demanding demoncratic reforms. Crowds throw rocks at troop contingent 4{ miles west of Tiananmen. 9 p.m.-10 p.m.  Troops hurl tear gas then open fire on the crowds. 12 midnight  Armored vehicles break through barricades and about 40 trucks carrying military personnel slowly advance toward the square from the west. 1 a.m. Sunday. Troops dash through flames caused by a burning-bus barricade at the major intersection of Xidan west of the square. More people shot as troops fire at crowds. A smaller group of about 1,000 military personnel enters the square from the east and shooting erupts. 2 a.m.  Thousands of troops arrive at the west side of the square and some of the riflemen open fire. 3:30 a.m.  Military units surround the square, trapping several thousand students inside. 4:30 a.m.  Armored personnel carriers enter the square. Students are told by loudspeaker that troops will move in and clear the area. 5 a.m.  Demonstrators, many walking hand-in-hand, begin leaving the square, ending their three-week occupation. Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early Sunday, shooting and beating their way through crowds of pro-democracy protesters in clashes that witnesses and doctors said killed at least 32 people. Hundreds were wounded. The troops cut a violent swath through the heart of Beijing to get to the the square, rolling through barricades and surging masses on the surrounding streets. By 3:30 a.m., soldiers and riot police had surrounded Tiananmen, boxing off several thousand students and supporters concentrated around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center. A half hour later, lights were turned out. The square was in darkness. You have to give up all hope, students said over their loudspeaker at the monument. You have to give your life to the movement. Students sang the Internationale, the communist anthem. At 4:30 a.m., armored personnel carriers entered the square and troops began moving slowly toward several thousand students clustered around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center. Sporadic gunfire could still be heard on the outskirts of the square as troops shot at crowds of thousands. The death and casualty toll was believed to be mounting rapidly. Ambulances and bicycle pedicabs went back and forth hauling away the wounded. One man was seen shot in the back, another in the head. An official loudspeaker on the square announced that the troops were moving in to clear the area as soldiers prepared to advance from all four sides. Ho Te-chien, a Taiwanese singer who defected to China in 1983 and has been active in the student movement, urged the students to leave. We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost too much blood, he said over a student loudspeaker. A 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, set up by students last week, remained standing. The main streets leading to the Tiananmen, China's symbolic political center, were sealed. Thousands fled from the square, where hundreds of thousands of people had gathered to support students in the third week of a sit-in. The assault came two weeks after Premier Li Peng declared martial law in Beijing and sent troops to the city. Hundreds of thousands of residents responded by blocking roads with trucks and their bodies. In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Saturday the situation in China had become ugly and chaotic. This will disturb the United States government, and will disturb the American people, considerably, he said. The secretary hinted that there could be repercussions to the Chinese government's use of violence. The standoff between troops and protesters had been tense but largely peaceful for weeks, with soldiers seemingly reluctant or unable to move against the crowds until the first widespread violence broke out Saturday afternoon. A doctor from the Fuxing Hospital in western Beijing, where troops began firing on street people, said the hospital had taken in 15 dead and so many wounded they had to be put in garages. A doctor from another hospital said 12 people died there. One soldier was killed when he was run over by an armored personnel carrier rushing toward the square, and another man was reported shot to death in a street clash elsewhere. A Swedish visitor, Tom Hansson, said he saw three people shot to death in clashes south of the square. The government is fascist! How can they do this to me? How can they do this to the people? cried a 28-year-old man who was shot in the leg. Most of those shot on the square were hurling rocks at the troops and people close to their front lines. A government loudspeaker on the square charged the students with counterrevolutionary turmoil and said the military was taking necessary means to end their rebellion. Sporadic clashes and dozens of injuries were reported on Saturday as soldiers made several attempts to reach the square. They retreated momentarily under barrages of rocks, shoes and other objects, then resumed their most violent push at about 8 p.m. Saturday, firing weapons and using tear gas and clubs as they moved toward Tiananmen. Thousands of troops armed with rifles marched up the east side of the square, beating people who got in their way. Students threw Molotov cocktails and other objects at them. One armored personnel carrier rammed into a burning bus on Changan Avenue, the main street running along the square, and was torched by students. Two people inside were dragged out by the crowds and beaten severely. Other armored personnel carriers drove up and down the avenue smashing down lane dividers and other barriers set up by citizens to block the army's way. More than 5,000 people chanting Freedom will survive! packed a Chinatown park this morning in a memorial service for students slain by soldiers in Tiananmen Square. They then marched through the streets in a funeral procession. The gods are crying for what's happening in China today. It's a great tragedy, said Harry Zinn of International Ladies Garment Workers Union Local 2325, addressing the crowd through a steady rain. Our hearts go out to the people of China. The crowd, which stood respectfully and silently during a traditional funeral ceremony, waved banners and wore buttons honoring the martyrs of Tiananmen Square and calling for democracy in China. After the service and several speeches, the crowd marched through the streets of Chinatown, led by a casket and a traditional Chinese funeral bier containing fruit and incense. As they headed up Mulberry Street, a major street in Chinatown, they walked beneath a 30-foot black banner strung across the road. This has united the Chinese people for one cause  to overthrow the government and establish democracy, said Peter Lee, one of the student organizers of the service. We must never allow them to crush another body. The funeral procession stretched for blocks through Chinatown, tying up traffic. Demonstrators planned another rally later in the day outside the United Nations.

Whenthe declaration of martial law did not intimidate the students andtheir supporters, the government resorted to the use of massiveforce. The pro- democracy movement started after the death of formerCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989 with studentsshouting ""Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!""","On June 3, 1989 at 1 a.m. tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing marching toward Tiananmen Square to dislodge student pro-democracy demonstrators who had  encamped there for three weeks. Within 28 hours the students were dispersed at a cost in lives estimated by the Chinese government at 300-400, by officials of the Chinese Red Cross as 2,600, and by others as between 3,000 and 12,000. The crisis was not at an end, however, as soldiers continued random shooting of civilians and rival factions of the Chinese army started shooting at one another. During June 5-9 governments around the world condemned the brutal suppression advising theirnationals to leave Beijing. Chinese abroad mourned the dead. Anti-government demonstrations spread to Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities. The pro-democracy movement had its origin with the death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989. By April 17 thousands of students marched in Beijing and Shanghai shouting ""Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!""

17,d109h," Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Floods continue to have  serious effects in Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces and  the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China. Information from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief  Headquarters revealed that the flood peak on the Xijiang River  today reached Guangdong Province. By eight o'clock yesterday morning, a peak flood water level  of 25.91 m [meters] was recorded at the flood monitoring station  of Guangxi's Wuzhou city, 10.91 m above the danger level. Flood water has entered urban and suburban areas of Wuzhou  city, and most of its transport and telecommunications with the  outside were suspended. This city borders Guangdong and lies on the Xunjiang River,  the name for the upper reaches of the Xijiang River. The speed of the flood-water was recorded as 46,200 cu  [cubic] m per second, the most ferocious since the founding of  New China in 1949. The flood peak on the Beijiang River in Guangdong Province  passed through Qingyuan city by 23:00 hours last night, and the  water level was recorded as 14.72 m, about 4.22 m above the  danger mark; the speed was 17,400 cu m per second. Flood control work in the Pearl River (Zhujiang) Delta area  is also very intense. The State Council, China's highest governing body, recently  sent a joint working group formed by the Ministries of Water  Resources, Construction and Civil Affairs to help fight floods  in Guangxi and in Guangdong. At 11 o'clock on Saturday, the flood peak on the Xiangjiang  River passed through Changsha city, capital of central China's  Hunan Province. The water level recorded at the local monitoring station was  38.93 m, some 3.93 m above danger level. High flood water  levels were also recorded at Hengyang and Xiangtan cities. About 118 towns of eight prefectures and cities along the  Xiangjiang River were flooded. Flood water has also entered more than 20 streets and lanes  of Changsha, and more than 300,000 city dwellers were affected.  More than 400 factories and 5,000 shops were forced to stop  production or stop business. More than half a million Armymen and local residents, under  the leadership of the Hunan provincial party provincial  committee and provincial people's government, are going all out  to fight the flood. By 22:00 hours last night, the flood peak passed through  Nanchang city, provincial capital of Jiangxi. Statistics from  the local monitoring station show that the flood water level was  25.42 m, about 2.62 m above the danger mark, and the speed of  the flood was 19,100 cu m per second. The Jiangxi provincial party committee and people's  government are mobilizing local people and the troops stationed  there to combat the floods. The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has  sent special teams of people to help fight floods in Hunan and  Jiangxi. Meanwhile, drought is continuing to blight most areas of  northern China and northeastern China, with about 15.3 million  hectares of land affected. In the drought-stricken areas, 12 million people and 12  million head of livestock are short of drinking water, according  to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.  Comrade Wen Jiabao [member of CPC Central Committee  Secretariat] and his party left Changsha for Zhuzhou and  Xiangtan yesterday. He inspected the flooded areas, including  Zhuzhou City's Xiawan dike, the Hexi New and High Technology  Development Zone, and Linghuayuan and Xiangtan's Yangtianhu,  Xingxiadi, Zhoujiangdi, and Shiwandalou, where rescue and relief  work was in full swing. After listening to reports submitted by  the two cities on their efforts to fight the flooding and do  relief work, he issued important instructions. Comrade Wen Jiabao fully affirmed the initial victories that  the two cities have scored in their flood fighting and relief  work under the leadership of the provincial party committee and  government. He said: In fighting floods and doing relief work,  the broad masses of cadres and people in Zhuzhou and Xiangtan  sacrificed their interests to rescue a large number of  industrial and mining enterprises, the Beijing-Guangzhou  Railway, the 107 National Highway, and cities and thus minimized  the losses caused by floods. This fully shows that, with party  leadership and the socialist system, we will be able to overcome  all difficulties. Regarding the work in the next stage, he  pointed out: We should continue to take flood fighting and  relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously  do a good job of reform, opening up to the outside world,  stability, other fields of work, and industrial and agricultural  production. He said: After the water recedes, we should firmly  grasp the opportunity and repair the damaged dikes and  embankments. As the highest flood season has not yet arrived,  we should be prepared at any time to meet new flood peaks  head-on rather than slacken our efforts. We should try every  possible means to provide food, clothing, and shelter to flood  victims, pay special attention to preventing and curing  diseases, and concentrate efforts on the resumption of  production and the reconstruction of homes. He particularly  stressed: The current flooding has revealed problems in the  construction of water conservancy facilities and urban flood  control. In the past, inadequate consideration has been given  to urban flood control and the coordination of urban and rural  flood control. In the next step, we should earnestly draw a  lesson from this negative experience. Governor Chen Bangzhu urged the party committees and  governments of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan to convey Comrade Wen  Jiabao's regards and instructions on behalf of the party Central  Committee and the State Council for the broad masses of cadres  and people to the party committees and governments at all levels  as soon as possible, earnestly implement them, and effectively  carry out the work of fighting floods, doing relief work, and  helping oneself by engaging in production.  Fuzhou, June 22 (CNS) -- Flood lasting for ten or  more days in Fujian Province has brought about heavy losses in  agriculture there. According to the latest information offered  by the Provincial Agricultural Bureau, a total area of 2.465  million mu of crops have been hit by the flood and of which, 446  000 mu of crops will have no yield, 1.957 million mu of grain  have been heavily hit and some 300 million kilogram grain are  expected to be lost. Among nine cities and prefectures in Fujian, those seriously  hit by the flood are Sanming, Nanping, Ningde, Fuzhou, Quanzhou  and Putian. Of these, Sanming City is worst hit by the flood.  In May, the city was hit by the heavy rainstorm and had big  losses and now it suffers again from the flood with some 600 000  mu of crops damaged by flood and 200 million kilogram grain  expected to be lost. Per capita possession of cultivated land in Fujian is only  0.05 mu. Even if in the normal years, grain output there is not  self- sufficient. The consecutive flood has made agricultural  production situation there more grim. Disaster-relief groups  have been sent to the flood-stricken areas striving for  minimizing losses.  Changsha, June 19 (XINHUA) -- This capital of  central China's Hunan province has been hit by floods in the  wake of a succession of rainstorms on the upper and middle  reaches of the Xiangjiang River. The water level of the river, which flows through Changsha,  is still rising sharply, according to local sources. By four o'clock this afternoon the level recorded at the  Changsha monitoring station had risen to 38.93 m, some 0.56 m  higher than the highest figure ever previously recorded. The  flood has caused serious losses to people along both banks of  the river, especially in Changsha, according to the sources. In the early hours of yesterday six villages and one fishing  ground at Yulushan township were flooded when an embankment  collapsed. Most of the 15,000 people affected by the flood there have  been evacuated to safer places. By six o'clock yesterday afternoon 19 dykes in the Changsha  area had collapsed, and a total of 128,000 urban and rural  residents had been affected. A partial collapse of the grand Longwangang embankment at  the  Xihu fishing ground in the Wangyuehu district of Changsha has  put the lives and property of 60,000 people in danger. But thanks to the concerted rescue efforts of 2,000 local  cadres, residents and soldiers there was no loss of life. The city government of Changsha has asked residents within  the endangered areas to relocate themselves and remove their  property to safer places, in case of the occurrence of more  serious flooding. By the early hours of this morning roads and surfaces of  bridges in the Wangyuehu district had been inundated. The flood  waters had also reached the boulevard along the Xiangjiang  River, Xiahe Street and the western part of Zhongshan Street in  Changsha proper. So far, more than 500,000 soldiers and local residents have  moved in to help fight the floods. Meanwhile, the Changsha city committee of the Communist  Party  has held an emergency meeting, urging all departments and the  people of the whole city to carry forward the spirit of  continuous fighting and unite as one in battling the floods. Wang Maolin, secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party  Committee, who is now in the province's southern city of Zhuzhou  to direct anti-flood efforts there. In a telephone call to the  Changsha city government, he called on local officials to adopt  effective measures, ensure the safety of the lives and property  of the residents of Changsha and make an overall success of the  work to conquer the flood.  Guangzhou, 19 Jun (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and  chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Li Peng,  premier of the State Council, are very much concerned about  floods in Guangdong Province. Recently, they repeatedly  inquired about the flood situation in the Zhu Jiang valley,  particularly that of Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang. They expressed  their deep concern for the people in the flood-hit areas, as  well as extended their warm greetings to the vast number of  cadres, officers, and men of the People's Liberation Army; armed  police officers; and public security police who battle on the  frontline against floods and provide disaster relief. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng gave important directives for  current  flood prevention and disaster relief tasks in Guangdong. They  expressed the hope that under the leadership of the Guangdong  provincial party committee and government, the Guangdong army  and people would make concerted efforts in disaster relief;  earnestly help flood victims solve their living problems; and go  all out to battle floods to ensure the safety of the Bei Jiang  dike, Guangzhou city, and the Zhu Jiang Delta.  Guangzhou, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The highest flood  peaks on the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers have passed, said Zhu  Senlin, governor of south China's Guangdong Province. While inspecting flood control and relief work in Qingyuan  city on the Beijiang River yesterday, he attributed Guangdong's  success in combating this flood -- almost the biggest in 100  years -- to concerted efforts by the armymen stationed in  Guangdong and local residents. More than 200 people lost their lives in the natural  disaster, which destroyed 189,000 rooms and ruined crops on 1.2  million hectares. The flood was caused by successive torrential rainstorms in  the Xijiang and Beijiang River valleys in early and middle June.  Major flood monitoring stations on the two rivers recorded  their highest water levels, all four meters above the danger  mark. Local governments at various levels in the province have  paid  close attention to flood control work, and leading government  and communist party officials of different localities have gone  to the flood-fighting front. No breaches of major embankments or reservoirs were reported  despite the most serious flood in a hundred years, effectively  protecting the safety of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, and  the Pearl (Zhujiang) River Delta. But the losses caused by the flood were quite serious, said  the governor. According to him, 11 million people in the province's nine  cities and 55 counties were affected, and more than 200 people  died in the natural disaster, with 189,000 rooms destroyed and  1.2 million hectares of crops ruined. The direct economic  losses were set at 10.2 billion yuan. The governor warned that though the flood danger had  receded,  the determination to fight possible further floods could not  slacken, as this is just the beginning: the main flood season,  which usually begins in late July and early August, has not yet  arrived. He urged local officials to be on constant alert against  further possible floods and be meticulous about flood prevention  and control measures, while doing their utmost to help flood  victims, assisting them to resume production as soon as possible  and maintaining social stability.  Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Floods have all  receded along Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang except  at a section of the Xijiang River in Wuzhou city, Guangxi, a  spokesman from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief  Headquarters announced today. The spokesman attributed the falling water level to the  major  water conservancy projects which help to mitigate losses.  Meanwhile, he said, tension has been eased in the Pearl River  delta as the latest tropical storm has been weakened after  landing in Yangjiang city, Guangdong Province. Floods hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujiang and  Zhejiang provinces following the first heavy rains and floods  which typically hit China from the south to the north from June  to August. Earlier reports said that successive torrential rainstorms  in  the Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys in early and mid-June  resulted in a big flood, one of the most serious in 100 years,  in Guangdong Province and caused heavy losses. Major flood  monitoring stations on the two rivers recorded their highest  water levels, all four meters above the warning level. In an urgent conference late yesterday, the Guangdong  provincial government urged localities to help flood victims  with food, shelter, clothing and medical care so that no one  would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in  the flooded areas. The province has allocated 300 million kg of grain and 110  million yuan in cash along with over 10 million tons of such  farm production supplies as chemical fertilizer and diesel oil  to the flood-stricken areas. Meanwhile, 740 million yuan in loans and another 50 million  yuan in donations have also been sent to flooded areas in  Guangdong Province. While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi  Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao,  alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the  Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas  should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts  and with support from various departments. While inspecting Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi, and  Fengcheng, Xingang, Jian and Taihe, on June 24-26, Wen said the  key to mitigating economic losses is to resume production as  soon as possible. The localities should waste no time in implementing various  measures to resume production and rehabilitate their homeland,  he said. As one of China's major bread baskets, Jiangxi is of key  importance to China in agricultural production, Wen said. It  has a direct bearing on the grain supply in south China. He  urged the local governments to farmers resume agricultural  production.  The following is a recorded report filed by this  station's reporter on the front lines of the province's battle  against the flooding yesterday. [Begin recording] Dear audience, it is now almost noon on 20  June. I'm reporting in Changshanyuan at the eastern gate of  Changsha City. This morning, Provincial Party Committee  Secretary Wang Maolin, provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu, and  some other provincial party and government leaders arrived here  in Changshayuan, on the front line of the province's flood  resistance effort, to direct the fight against the flooding. Governor Chen Bangzhu and vice Governor Zheng Peimin just  arrived back in Changsha at about 0700 this morning after  attending a Beijing meeting. As soon as they stepped out from  the train, they set out for Changshayuan, the front line of the  province's flood resistance. I interviewed Governor Chen  Bangzhu here on the spot. [Reporter] How are you, Governor Chen? You have inspected  some flood-stricken areas in Changsha City this morning. Will  you please tell our audience something about the province's  flood situation? [Governor] This year, Hunan has been hit by a flood of a  severity unseen for the past 100 years in terms of both water  level and quantity. Over the past few days, the broad masses of  Army personnel and people across the province have been bravely  fighting the flood and have been making concerted efforts to  provide disaster relief to afflicted areas, with the result that  some of the province's key dams have remained sound and economic  losses have been reduced to a minimum. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm  regards and thanks to the broad masses of Army personnel and  people fighting in the front lines of the province's battle  against the flood. At the moment, the province's flood  situation remains very serious, because the water level is still  high. According to weather forecasts and meteorological  reports, the province is expecting more rain to fall over the  next few days. We will definitely encounter more hardships and  difficulties. Under the current circumstances, the broad masses  of Army personnel and people across the province should further  step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention  and disaster relief work, this being an overriding task at the  moment. We are full of confidence that, under the leadership of the  CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the broad masses of  the Hunan Army personnel and people will be able to overcome the  difficulties and hardships caused by natural calamities such as  flooding, waterlogging, and so on and will win a complete  victory in the on-going flood prevention and disaster relief  struggle. [end recording]  Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State  Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest  or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China  occurred a few days ago in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang,  and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are dropping  slowly; however, high water levels will remain in these rivers  for the next few days. Due to interaction of the Bei Jiang and  Xi Jiang, the Zhujiang Delta will face a high water-level test. Heavy rainfall over a wide area since mid-June resulted in  the largest flood waters since liberation of the country in the  Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, and Xiang Jiang rivers. The flood water in  Guangdong's Xi Jiang crested in Gaoyao County on 20 June; the  water level in Gaoyao's Xi Jiang dropped to 13.37 meters at 0600  today. A flood peak occured in Bei Jiang in Guangdong's Sanshui  at 0400 on 20 June, raising the water level to 10.39 meters --  the largest flood level ever recorded. The water level droppped  to 10.16 meters at 0600 today. Drops in water levels in Guangdong's Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang  do not mean that Guangdong's flooding situations have eased,  because flood waters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain  at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea  after the two flood waters jointly flow through the low-lying  Zhujiang Delta. In particular, the sea tide may add to the  flood waters on 25 June. With these factors combined, the  Zhujiang Delta, which has a developed economy and a forest of  factories, will face the most rigorous flood water test since  the liberation of the country. The situation in the Xiang Jiang is also not an easy one.  The flood peak passed Changsha on 19 June, but the water level  at the Changsha Station was still at 25 meters at 0200 today  [1800 GMT 20 June]. Because the water level has remained high  for a long period, several dangerous situations have occured  along the river's dikes. Dike reinforcing work needs to be  stepped up. The flood peak in Gan Jiang entered Boyang Lake on 20 June.  However, due to continued rains over the last few days, the  water level in the upper reaches west of Ganzhou has begun to  rise again. At 0800 today, the water level at the Ganzhou  Station was 100.95 meters, 3.45 meters above the warning level.","FBIS4-26245,FBIS4-26532,FBIS4-26516,FBIS4-26242,FBIS4-26768,FBIS4-26327,FBIS4-26604,FBIS4-26769,FBIS4-26614,FBIS4-26392",Record setting floods ravage much of south China.,"Torrential rains have caused the worst flooding in 100 years in many areas of southern China.

18,d107g,"Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current U.S. drought, weather experts warned during a drought symposium here. Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria, said Pat Michaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the symposium. He said the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places, has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers. I'm worried ... that when the next drought happens, we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem, said Michaels, president of the Association of State Climatologists. Experts said Thursday that the greenhouse effect  the warming of the Earth's atmosphere  has brought needed attention to changes in the global climate, even though it is not directly related to the drought. Many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposium agreed that the Earth's temperature is warming, but they debated whether it is a short- or long-term phenomenon and its impact on Earth. However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program in Washington, D.C., said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertaking policies that make sense in their own right. Mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuels, he said, by becoming more energy efficient, replanting forests and investigating alternative energy supplies. Scientists have warned in recent years that Earth's atmosphere is gaining in carbon dioxide and other gases, which trap heat and cause the overall temperature to rise. Besides fossil fuels, the depletion of forests in South America has been blamed for the increase of carbon dioxide and methane. Some have warned that higher temperature will change the character of many countries, for example drying out the U.S. Midwest or melting polar ice caps. The symposium was sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live. Earlier Thursday, the climatologists were told the movement of planets and the moon and sunspots may help lead to drought in the Southeast. There is some evidence that as Jupiter goes around the sun at its fastest point, there are drought conditions in the Southeast in the months of April and October, Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer said. However, David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington, said he was skeptical of Plummer's thesis. There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase, Rodenhuis said. The next business of the scientist is to ... extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect. The crippling drought hitting North America is expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported today. The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last year's level, which was already below the expected production. If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported. As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said. If crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further. Such a development would have serious implications for the food security, particularly of many low-income, food-deficit countries, the report said. The high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned. It said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed countries. The most severely hit crops are coarse grains  mostly maize, barley and oats, the report said. The agency projected good harvests in other parts of the world. In Asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time, and production in Europe and the Soviet is expected to be larger than last year. Grain production in South America should be slightly lower this year than last. In the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa, however, locusts flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this year's harvest. Potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million tons, FAO said. Weather experts discussed the drought Thursday and its possible causes and effects, and said they hoped to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last. All of the speakers at the 1988 Drought Symposium called for more research and study. There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase. The next business of the scientist is to eliminate the possibilities of ... and extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect, said David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington. The symposium attended by 13 state and national experts was sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live. John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said the drought in the Southeast might be lessened or ended in the next few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season. Hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane season. He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable, depending on the intensity and speed of the storm. Nevertheless, he said, some Southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their rainfall in some months from hurricanes. Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer told the symposium he thought the position of the planet Jupiter had something to do with drought in the Southeast. However, Rodenhuis said he was skeptical about Plummer's thesis. It's very necessary to be cautious and analytical about the issue, he said. Heavy rain deluged some drought-hit areas as Congress began working on a package of relief for America's farmers, and farmers in Kentucky today greeted the arrival of the first shipment of hay airlifted free from Oregon. Everything looks so good with a bit of rain over the past 24 hours, farmer Herman Krone said Tuesday at his 2,800-acre farm in southern Illinois, which President Reagan plans to visit Thursday during a tour of the drought-stricken area. However, Krone said, almost one-third of his 1,200 acres of corn already have been lost. Marth Wilkinson, wife of Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and business manager of the family's farm, was at Louisville's Standiford Field today for the arrival of the first hay shipment from Portland, Ore. United Parcel Service plans to ship free of charge 20 to 30 tons of hay from Portland to Louisville each day for the next two weeks. The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, issued a report predicting severe damage to the harvest from the drought. It estimated, for example, that corn output this year would shrivel to 5.2 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion last year. The dry weather is the largest drought that our nation has ever experienced, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told legislators. I think history will show that it's truly more mammoth than any of us has ever experienced. Extremely heavy rain fell Tuesday in sections of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. In Texas, more than 6{ inches fell in 75 minutes in Mesquite, washing a pickup truck and several cars into a creek and leaving some homes 8 inches deep in water. Water was up to the tops of cars in Garland and street flooding was reported in Heath. Nearly 6 inches fell in DeQueen, Ark. Showers and thunderstorms were widespread over the Middle Atlantic States, the Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast states. Thunderstorms boomed today over the Dakotas and Minnesota. In Washington, the House and Senate Agriculture committees began working on wide-ranging legislation that would provide payments of up to $100,000 each to farmers whose crops have been wiped out by the dry spell. House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, called for final action on the measure by mid-August. The drought has dried up pastures, forcing livestock farmers to go far afield for hay. The hay that arrived in Kentuky today will be stored at a fairgrounds, and distributed next week by lottery to farmers, who will pay for the hay, officials said. It seems like everyone in the state wants this hay, state Department of Agriculture spokesman Roger Nesbitt said Tuesday. The delay has angered some farmers, such as Bernetta Smith, who expects to run out of hay for her 147 beef cows in one to two days. I don't see any sense in storing it because people need this hay. I don't understand it, she said. At least 50 truckloads of hay gathered from the Carolinas and Virginia are being shipped to Ohio on Thursday in a drive organized by the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. Despite the recent rain, communities with dried-up water supplies continue to restrict water use. Until the drought ends, the 650 residents of Vintondale, Pa., about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, will have to do without running water from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. every day, Mayor Michael Palovich said Tuesday. Palovich said he was trying to arrange for an emergency supply to be trucked in. The drought has had a silver lining for anglers in the Reno, Nevada, area. The state Board of Wildlife Commissioners removed the limit on catches at Rye Patch and Lahontan reservoirs because the reservoirs are expected to be dry by the end of summer, leaving fish high and dry. Here is a state-by-state summary of drought developments Wednesday: Weather forecasters today were offering drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months. A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months. The disappointing forecast came as President Reagan headed to the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms. On Tuesday the Agriculture Department reported sharp declines in the outlook for several crops. That was followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken areas from the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short of rain. That area, which includes the major grain-growing states where crops already are suffering, is given a 55 percent chance of less than normal rainfall. And some states in the center of the area, stretching from West Virginia to Nebraska and from Wisconsin to Missouri, may be even drier. They are given a 60 percent chance of being short of precipitation. A slice of southern California, including Los Angeles, is the driest area in the forecast, with a 70 percent chance of having below normal rainfall. The rest of coastal California also will be dry, the forecast said. The outlook also says there's a 55 percent chance of hotter than normal temperatures through the U.S. heartland from New England to Idaho and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma. Within that area, the chances of high temperatures are above 65 percent in Wyoming, while central Midwestern states have a 60 percent chance of above average temperatures. Wetter than normal weather is predicted for west and south Texas, and parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Normal precipitation is forecast for the Atlantic and Gulf coast states, along with the Northwest and northern Mountain States. The Weather Service said normal temperatures are expected for the Atlantic states from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast states. West Texas and New Mexico may be cooler than normal, but the far West is expected to see its normal quota of summer heat. The separate drought impact assessment, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, points out that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing, since dry spells have no normal lifetime. The low 4 percent probability of an end within 3 months is based simply on a statistical analysis of past droughts, the agency said. The report noted that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme drought, with parts of 35 states affected. That puts the current drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934. Kentucky's governor has criticized the federal government for being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor warns that farmers in his state still face potential disaster despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend. Crews began installing pumps on barges Monday to haul fresh water to southern Louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in the lower Mississippi River. Meanwhile, House Speaker Jim Wright said in Washington he hopes that a relief package with disaster payments of up to $100,000 for drought-stricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready for floor action in Congress this week. Here is a state-by-state summary of the latest drought developments: The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday. But the United States will continue to be a major player in world agriculture and in 1989 should be able to bounce back from this year's drought losses, he said. Lyng's remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors. A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records began in 1895, he said. Moreover, on July 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous United States was in the severe to extreme drought category, he said. In 1934, more than 60 percent was so rated, and in August 1954 more than 50 percent was in that category. Because of the large early season area now experiencing drought in the U.S., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s, Lyng said. Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the United States will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand, he said. Lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much higher. But it is important to note that we will have no shortages, that we will still be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas buyers, he said.","AP880715-0065,AP880711-0056,AP880714-0156,AP880713-0121,AP880713-0175,AP880714-0085,AP880712-0250,AP880716-0052,AP880711-0221",Worst drought in nearly a century affects major grain growing areas.,"The worst drought to hit the United States since 1895, when record keeping began, has damaged grain crops in the major grain growing states and could lead to food shortages in poorer nations. The drought has forced some states to import hay from other states. Communities in many states have imposed tight water rationing.",A severe drought continues to affect large areas of the United States and climatologists warn that the future could see more unless steps are taken to halt the earth's rising temperature. The drought is the worst since records began being kept in 1895 and hasaffected grain production across the nation. Grain supplies are expected to fall to 17 percent of what is required to safeguard world food security. Communities in the areas affected have restricted water use and Oregon has begun to ship hay to Kentucky. Some areas have seen some relief as heavy storms hit large sections of the country.,"A severe drought has affected large portions of the United States as rainfall was below normal in major grain growing states. The drought, rated severe by July 2, is the worst noted since the U.S. began keeping records in 1895 and affects about 35 percent of the contiguous United States.  If conditions continue, the areas affect could exceed the 60 percent of 1934 and the 50 percent of 1954. The drought has caused grain and soybean futures to drop and grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of what is considered necessary to safeguard world food security. Many poorer nations could face food shortages as grain prices rise. Many communities from Iowa to Alabama face water shortages that leave officials seeking alternate water supplies. Other areas have imposed bans on outdoor water use.

19,d110h,"THE INVASION: Iraq's troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and government buildings 40 miles away. Early Friday, the invaders controlled Kuwait city, the capital. The soldiers were also making sweeps through the southern oilfields, according to residents and Lloyds' insurance service in London. Diplomatic sources estimate more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion. Kuwait's Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia.  THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border. Kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, has 1.9 million residents  60 percent foreigners  and an army of 20,300 soldiers.  CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil prices through overproduction. Kuwait and U.N. diplomats dismissed Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries.  REACTION: The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion. President Bush denounced it as naked agression. He froze Iraq's assets in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi imports, including oil. The order also froze Kuwait property under U.S. jurisdiction  a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it. The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales to Iraq. Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the nation had asked for American military intervention. A Pentagon source said a U.S. naval group was diverted toward the Persian Gulf. Oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion would reduce the supply of oil. Administration and congressional officials agree that the CIA did its job. Since last week, President Bush had been warned by intelligence analysts that what originally looked like a military bluff was quickly turning into the kind of troop deployment that could be used to invade Kuwait or even Saudi Arabia. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster even hand-delivered certain fresh details on the Iraqi buildup to National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Among the assessments he conveyed was a conclusion that, by this week, President Saddam Hussein's force would be capable of penetrating Kuwait or Saudi Arabia. The agency lacked hard evidence of an intent to invade, intelligence officials say. But as the buildup grew, the CIA became more alarmed, partly because Mr. Hussein is so unpredictable, and partly because, unlike many other Arab leaders, he has been known to carry out his threats. Saudi Arabia has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which places Iraqi forces near the oil-rich kingdom's border. Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against Iraq  closing the pipeline that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea. The executives said the Saudis believe this would give Iraq's belligerent president, Saddam Hussein, an excuse to attack and occupy Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, giving Iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world. The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press Agency the day after the Iraqi move. The statement said Saudi Arabia was following the Kuwait situation with extreme concern and that King Fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the interests of all. The statement did not condemn the invasion. The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwaiti government in the wake of the invasion was to shelter members of the ruling family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the crown prince. Both nations are tightly run by royal families and have been close allies. The Saudis also allowed the Kuwaiti royal family to briefly operate a radio, reportedly from a mobile van, in the area around the Saudi-Kuwait border. But Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call: The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help. It was not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Saddam at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade Saudi Arabia as well. Saudi Arabia borders Kuwait and Iraq's invasion forces were reportedly near the Saudi border. The Saudis did condemned the invasion as part of a joint statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is allied with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. The six states issued a statement saying, We strongly condemn and are very sorry for this attack that one Arab state took against another Arab state. ... We do not recognize anything resulting from it. Iraq's 1-million-member armed forces is clearly too much for the joint 3,000-member Gulf Cooperation Council force or Saudi Arabia's 65,700-member army. Saudi Arabia was also one of the 14 members of the 21-member Arab League that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Arab League, with one-third of its members voting against the resolution or abstaining, was clearly unable to take any direct action. Turkey has also refused to take action and has not commented about President Bush's suggestion that it cut off Iraq's oil pipeline to the Mediterranean. Two parallel pipelines pump Iraqi crude oil to a terminal at Yumurtalik at the eastern corner of Turkey's Mediterranean coast and constitute Iraq's major oil export outlet. Ruling party members said today that the government, fearing a U.S. air attack, was distributing automatic weapons to tens of thousands of supporters and preparing to evacuate the Iraqi capital. A boycott of Iraqi oil forced Baghdad today to close one of two pipelines in Turkey that were pumping the bulk of Iraq's exported oil, Turkish officials said. A British official said Iraqi troops rounded up American and British visitors in Kuwait and taking them to Iraq. The Foreign Office spokesman said most were passengers from a British Airways flight stranded in Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion Thursday. There is no evidence that they are in any way in trouble, the official said. Saudi Arabia was reported reinforcing its troops along the Kuwaiti border following concerns Iraq may try to invade it. Pentagon sources said the USS Independence and its carrier battle group are now on station in the Arabian Sea, a position that would allow it to launch fighter planes into the Persian Gulf region. Gulf-based diplomats said soldiers from the American rapid deployment force, formed to react to crises in the Middle East, had been dispatched to the area. In other developments: The new Kuwait government installed by Iraq hinted it might take hostages or seize property of nations that take punitive measures against Iraq. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said the 100,000 soldiers who invaded Kuwait began to pull back Sunday. President Bush said Iraq was lying. Oil prices jumped more than $3 a barrel on news Europe and Japan were joining the embargo of Iraqi oil. Stocks slumped worldwide. Hospital officials said at least 300 Kuwaiti and Iraqi soldiers were killed during the invasion. In London, Kuwaitis arriving on a special plane said 700 Kuwaitis died. The embargo of Iraqi oil grew over the weekend to include Japan and the European Community. Along with the United States, they bought more than half Iraq's exported oil, with most of it pumped through Turkey. An official of the state-run Turkish pipeline company BOTAS said pumping stopped at one of the two Turkish pipelines at 5 p.m. Iraq reduced flow in the second, wider, pipeline to 70 percent of capacity, they said. There was no comment from Iraq. The two pipelines pump Iraqi crude from Kirkuk oil fields in northern Iraq to a terminal at the northeastern tip of the Mediterranean. They carry 70 million tons of crude annually, providing the outlet for the major share of Iraqi exports. The BOTAS official said all the countries participating in the embargo purchase their Iraqi crude from the Turkish outlet. Iraq also exports oil through a Saudi Arabian pipeline and via tankers in the northern Persian Gulf. A Foreign Office spokesman said today as saying a total of 366 people had been assembled by Iraqi troops in Kuwait, mostly passengers from a stranded British Airways flight. They were being transported by bus to the Iraqi border. Baghdad did not give any reason for its action. Immediately after the invasion Thursday, 11 Americans were rounded up by Iraqi troops. They turned up safe in Baghdad. The new Iraqi-installed foreign minister of Kuwait, Lt. Col. Walid Sa'oud Mohammed Abdullah, warned against further sanctions in a statement broadcast Sunday by Iraqi radio. Countries that resort to punitive measures against the provisional free Kuwait government and fraternal Iraq should remember that they have interests and nationals in Kuwait, he said. Iraqi soldiers invaded Kuwait after complaining that its violation of OPEC production quotas was driving down world crude prices, lowering Iraqi oil revenues. Saddam also accused Kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides claim. The respected Middle East Economic Survey reported today that Kuwait's oil export facilities had been shut down. It also said there was considerable doubt Saudi Arabia, with the world's largest oil reserves, would be willing to make up the potential world oil shortage. Kuwait and Iraq together account for one-fifth of the 23.5 million barrels produced daily by the 13 OPEC nations. Tensions remained high in the region; a U.S. official said in Washington that Iraqi troops massed on the Kuwaiti-Saudi border were apparently digging in. An American technician at a secret Saudi Arabian base said the kingdom had sent 200 to 300 tanks toward its border with Kuwait. Oil industry sources in Saudi Arabia reached by telephone from Bahrain said Saudi troops were entering the region of Khafji, near the border. Residents reached by telephone reported intense air activity near the Saudi airport overnight. The Washington Post reported today that Egypt was mobilizing some elements of its armed forces to assist Saudi Arabia in the event of an invasion. U.S. officials said there was no indication Iraqi troops were preparing to invade Saudi Arabia. But Bush sent Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to the kingdom to confer with its leaders, and the White House said Secretary of State James A. Baker would go this week to Turkey. Saadi Mehdi Saleh, the Iraqi army commander, was quoted by the Al-Iraq newspaper as saying tens of thousands of volunteers had joined the army to defend what he called Iraq and the revolution in Kuwait. Americans, he was quoted as saying, should understand that the people of the great leader Saddam Hussein cannot be frightened. Local members of the ruling Baath party said preparations were under way to evacuate all of Baghdad's 4 million people to camps outside the city. They were being told that the U.S. Air Force might attack or that Israel might attack with chemical or nuclear weapons. The party members also said the party had distributed guns, mainly AK-47 automatic rifles, to tens of thousands of people around the country. State radio said Saddam had ordered the formation of 11 new Iraqi army divisions, expected to generate 100,000 troops. The Arab world's most formidible military force is already estimated at 1 million men. At a border checkpoint 30 miles south of the Iraqi port city of Basra, dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying hundreds of soldiers crossed back into Iraq on Sunday. But thousands of Iraqi soldiers remained behind in Kuwait, controlling major government buildings, commerical centers and ports. Diplomats in the region said a new Kuwaiti army fanned out through Kuwait. The force comprises about 80,000 troops, mostly Iraqis. The nine-member Kuwaiti military government, announced by Iraq on Saturday, remained a mystery. No photographs of the named leaders have been shown and 12 reporters brought to Kuwait by the Ministry of Information could not locate any of them. Kuwaiti diplomats said they were all Iraqis, including a son-in-law of Saddam, a charge official Iraqi media denied. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring Kuwait. The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflected the brutality Saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 1979. The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the president considered Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to Iraq. Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of living. Oh God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them, he said last month after prices tumbled below $14 per barrel. He accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border, and demanded that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraq during the Persian Gulf war. Saddam was reported to be incensed that Kuwait was demanding repayment for the wartime loans. Saddam said he fought the war to protect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly Shiite Moslem Iran. Never mind that Iraq started the war in 1980 by invading Iran after a series of border skirmishes along the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf. Despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory, the long conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging on for eight years. It has still not formally ended. The war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the Iraqi people directly after the war. The 1990 budget slashed funds for imports and Iraqis were told to brace for another year of austerity. Private investment has failed to take hold. Iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt. Its main gulf port of Basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure damaged. Tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war languish in Iranian prisons and an estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded. Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's 100 billion barrels. By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstanding wish for more gulf coastline. Iraq's 100,000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulate to Iraq's demands. But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new OPEC quotas and Saddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he would not invade lulled the Arab world into the sense the crisis was over. Homage to the cause of Arab unity has been paramount in Middle East politics since postwar independence from colonial powers. Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s brought Egyptian and Saudi Arabian intervention on opposing sides, no Arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow Arab League member. Despite Iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate Kuwait, it has long coveted the tiny emirate. The Iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in 1961 and threatened to attack then, but backed down when Britain landed troops in Kuwait. The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors along the Gulf. It proved the decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait was toothless. The GCC did not issue a statement, much less implement its mutual defense treaty. While Iraq was unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use the precedent of Kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues. Bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to Kuwait when it balked at Iraqi demands. Also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs, the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable. In a series of bellicose statements in recent months, Saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside Iraq. In March he threatened to burn half of Israel with Iraq's chemical weapons  banned under international law  if Iraq was attacked. It was a popular stance among Arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a Palestinian nation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Then Britain arrested several people on charges they were smuggling nuclear triggers into Baghdad. Weeks later, police in Europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of firing chemical or nuclear shells into Israel. Saddam cried foul, claiming the West was trying to wreck the scientific progress of the Arabs. Saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nassar as the leader of the Arab world. His relentless personality cult has dubbed him The Knight of the Arabs. For Kuwait on Thursday, he was a dark knight. Asked the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador to Washington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said at a news conference: Ambition. Hegemony. Control of the whole area. There is not any reason for it. Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators embraced warmly Tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border dispute, sources said. Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border. Gulf-based diplomatic sources said the Iraqi force, triple the number earlier reported, included about 300 Soviet-made tanks, and dwarfed the entire Kuwaiti army of 20,000 troops. The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the troops have been concentrated along the border since last week, when Iraq began threatening Kuwait. Iraq accused the small Persian Gulf state of stealing oil from a disputed border region and forcing oil prices to drop. The diplomats said the number of troops was at first difficult to determine. The delegation leaders, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah of Kuwait, and Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, met privately for two hours. There were no details on the negotiations, but sources said the meetings will continue Wednesday. Diplomatic sources have said they expect Arab mediators to push the two sides to sign a treaty of non-belligerency to be followed by protracted negotiations on borders and compensation. The Iraq-Kuwait crisis broke out on July 17 when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of driving down oil prices by exceeding quotas set for them by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saddam said the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost revenue. Saddam also demanded compensation for the $2.4 billion in oil he claimed Kuwait pumped illegally from an oil field which straddles the unmarked border between the two countries. Iraq also demanded that Kuwait forgive $15 billion in loans it extended to Baghdad during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's tough talk appeared to have succeeded. Kuwait and the U.A.E agreed to stick to their oil quotas at an OPEC meeting last week. OPEC member states also agreed to a longstanding Iraqi demand to raised target crude oil prices from $18 to $21 a barrel. Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials agreed to meet in Jiddah after intensive mediation efforts by King Fahd and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Kuwaiti leaders had insisted that Iraq pull back its troops before conciliation talks could began, but later dropped that demand. Kuwaiti officials also asked that Iraq agree to demarcate the disputed border between the nations, a move Iraq has refused. Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait and has long coveted the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which command access to Iraq's sole outlet into the Persian Gulf. The mediators have succeeded in toning down a vitriolic campaign against Kuwait by the Iraqi state-run media. On Tuesday, the Iraqi delegation left Baghdad without any public announcement. The leading Al-Thawra daily newspaper called the Jiddah meeting an opportunity ... for Kuwait ... to perceive Iraq's demands and respond to its rights. In contrast, the Kuwaiti delegation left for Jiddah with fanfare and publicity. The Kuwaiti papers said they hoped the Jiddah meeting was the start of a final just settlement of the differences between Iraq and Kuwait, in a manner ensuring the legitimate rights of each. UNITED NATIONS  The United States urged other U.N. members at talks Sunday to impose broad economic and military sanctions on Iraq. Western diplomats said the world body is expected to adopt the measures. Should the U.N. Security Council impose comprehensive sanctions, it would be the first time since 1967 it has taken such action against a member state. The last time such sanctions were imposed was against the white minority government of Rhodesia. Western diplomats said they expected up to 14 positive votes on the 15-member council for sanctions against Iraq. They said they expected no vetoes, allowing the legally binding measure to be adopted, probably on Monday. They said Cuba was the holdout. U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporters after closed-door talks Sunday that the council discussed the absolute necessity of moving ahead toward a broad resolution of sanctions. He said he expected a vote Monday. Pickering said the United States had circulated six or seven drafts of a detailed resolution. It calls for an embargo on Iraq's oil exports, an embargo on imports to Iraq, and a halt to all arms and other military supplies for Iraq. British Ambassador Crispen Tickell told reporters later that he detected strong support, with the exception of one member, for action and a vote tomorrow. Speaking of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Canadian Ambassador L. Yves Fortier declared, This madman must be stopped. Cuban envoy Ricardo Alarcon said Cuba would vote for sanctions against Iraq only if the council imposed sanctions on South Africa for occupying Namibia, Israel for occupying Palestinian territories and the United States for invading Panama. In Kuwait, the Iraqi-installed provisional government, in a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, told other countries to refrain from taking punishing measures against it or Iraq. The provisional government said countries have to remember they have interests and citizens in Kuwait. Kuwait's U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Abulhasan told reporters that the Iraqi-installed government was employing pure blackmail by saying it could not ensure the safety of foreigners if their governments support sanctions. In Aspen, Colo., British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher renewed her call for the United Nations to apply a total economic embargo against Iraq unless it withdraws immediately from Kuwait. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait defies every principle for which the U.N. stands. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel safe again. The law of the jungle takes over, she said, in remarks at the Aspen Institute. The U.N. role in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis assumed increasing importance after divided Arab nations cancelled an emergency summit on the invasion. On Thursday, the Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion, demanded immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal, and threatened to impose sanctions if Iraq did not pull out. Sunday's session was scheduled after weekend meetings of the council's five permanent members  the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France  and between the United States and representatives of the Non-Aligned Movement. They are the nations with the power to veto proposals. The United States contends that stiff sanctions by a united international front are necessary to punish Iraq and to force it to withdraw from Kuwait, which was invaded Thursday. An emergency Arab League Council failed to publicly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday and adjourned its meeting for 24 hours as Arab leaders held urgent consultations on how to handle the crisis. Kuwait's Cabinet affairs minister, Abdel-Rahman el-Awadi told reporters he asked the 21-nation Arab League to condemn the attack. He accused Iraq of using the laws of the jungle. President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein met in Alexandria and telephoned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President Bush, Saudi King Fahd and Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh on the crisis. Hussein later left for home. Sources close to the Arab League Council said its members agreed to convene an emergency Arab summit but decided to leave the when and where up to Arab leaders. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The Council meeting of foreign ministers was convened in Cairo at Kuwaiti request hours after Iraqi military forces took over the small Persian Gulf state. Some member nations sent lower-level representatives. Following its evening session, attended by Saadoon Hamadi, a member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Council, Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt told reporters the Council would meet again Friday. Saddam promised Mubarak two weeks ago that he would not invade Kuwait in their oil dispute. At Thursday's closed session, Hamadi reiterated Iraq's claim its forces entered Kuwait at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had overthrown the government. A conference source said several Arab foreign ministers replied that they considered this to be an Iraqi invasion which is against all United Nations and Arab League conventions. So far, only Lebanon's prime minister and foreign minister, Salim Hoss, has joined Kuwait in Cairo in publicly condemning the invasion  the first time in modern history one Arab country invaded another to take control of the government. Hoss told reporters, We do not see any justification for what happened, whatever the arguments and pretexts. The invasion was denounced by the United States and other Western nations and by the Soviet Union. The Arab League Council met early Thursday and then adjourned to await the arrival of Hamdoon. Iraq's ambassador to Egypt, Nabil Najm, sat in until Hamdoon arrived. The United Nation's Security Council has condemned the invasion and the issue is now being discussed within the framework of the Arab League and we hope that it will issue a condemnation within the hour and that Arabs stand against this invasion, Kuwait's Awadi said. Arab leaders must take the initiative and stop this bloodshed and return things to their normal situation. We also call on Iraq to withdraw its troops. Hamadi told reporters upon arrival, I see this meeting as unnecessary ... There is no government presently in Kuwait. There is a group which started the revolution and which will reveal itself shortly. His comments were carried by the Middle East News Agency. MENA said Kuwait invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact and asked the Arab League Council to dispatch a joint Arab force to defend Kuwait against the invasion. In the event of military aggression against any League member, the pact all members, to take, individually and collectively, all steps available, including the use of armed force, to repel the aggression and restore security and peace. The ministers were in Cairo to attend the Organization of Islamic Conference's foreign ministers meeting. All Arab League members also belong to the Islamic conference. The U.N. Security Council today overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil purchases, to punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait. The vote was 13-0, with two abstentions by Cuba and Yemen on the 15-member council, which adopted the sanctions resolution proposed by the United States. It said Iraq had launched an armed attack against Kuwait and usurped the authority of Kuwait's legitimate government. The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution. President Bush praised the decision and called for full and total implementation of these sanctions, ruling out nothing at all. He told reporters at the White House: The will of nations around the world will be to enforce these sanctions. It was the third time in its 45-year existence that the world body had voted sanctions against a member state. The last time was 1967 when the Security Council voted similar, comprehensive sanctions against the white minority government of Rhodesia. An arms embargo against South Africa still is in effect. The sanctions are legally binding for all member nations, although past council resolutions have often been ignored or flouted. The United Nations has no enforcement mechanism but later could call on members to take military action against Iraq or impose a blockade. The vote followed similar sanctions imposed on Iraq by much of the West, including the United States, Japan and the European Community. The Soviet Union and China said they would halt arms shipments to Iraq. In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations not to take punishing measures against it or Iraq. The provisional government said countries have to remember they have interests and citizens in Kuwait. The U.N. role in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis assumed increasing importance after divided Arab nations canceled a weekend emergency summit on the invasion. In an emergency session just hours after Thursday's invasion, the Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion, demanded immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal, and called for negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait. The council threatened to impose sanctions if Iraq did not comply. The council includes the five permanent members with veto power  the United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union. The 10 non-permanent members are: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire. The U.N. Security Council today swiftly condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, demanding an unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops and calling for immediate negotiations between the countries. The Iraqi envoy said his country's troops would withdraw as soon as the situation is stable, perhaps within a few days or some weeks. The Security Council resolution was adopted 14-0 in an emergency session requested by the United States and Kuwait hours after today's pre-dawn invasion. Neither Kuwait nor Iraq is on the 15-member council. The representative of Yemen said he did not vote because he had not received instructions from his government. Britain's U.N. envoy, Crispin Tickell, condemned the invasion as an ugly moment in world affairs. Kuwait is a former British colony. The United States has made it clear that it will stand shoulder to shoulder with Kuwait in this time of crisis, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering told the council. It is our understanding that the present aggression was completely unprovoked. Baghdad radio claimed Iraq had come to the aid of revolutionary youth in Kuwait whom it said had toppled the Kuwaiti government. Kuwait's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Abulhasan, denied the invasion was in response to a call from help from a new government. The pretext to invade an independent, sovereign state is a false, flimsy pretext, he said.

On July 17, 1990 Iraq provoked a major crisis by accusing Kuwait of costing it billions by exceeding Kuwait's OPEC assigned oil production quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, by stealing Iraqi oil from a disputed border oil field, and also by demanding repayment of a $15 billion war debt.  After Egyptian and Saudi Arabian mediation failed, Iraq invaded Kuwait with 100,000 troops led by 350 tanks.  It quickly overran Kuwaiti defenses and continued south to the oil fields.  Kuwait leaders, including the emir, escaped to Saudi Arabia.  They appealed for U.S. military intervention.  The Pentagon diverted an aircraft carrier group toward the gulf.  A U.S. led U.N. resolution demanded that Iraq immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Kuwait.  Iraq responded that it invaded at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had already overthrown the government of Kuwait and this was not a U.N. matter.  The U.N. rejected this justification as a farce and imposed strong economic and military sanctions after Iraq failed to withdraw.

20,d092c,"The earthquake that struck northern Iran broughtreminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquakein Armenia killed about 25,000 people. Most died in structures thatcollapsed when the quake hit.It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, said RussNeedham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, butThursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7according to the U.S. Geological Survey.In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by thefact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just aftermidnight. Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of aceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report laterblamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by somethingfalling on top of you, said Needham in a telephone interview fromGolden, Colo.The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings arebuilt on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in anearthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in thatarea, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said.Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and thatthere have been many smaller quakes.Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred inIran during the last 30 years, Needham said.A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capableof widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.Planes loaded with food, medicine and tentsare converging on earthquake-stricken Iran from around the world,among them the first private American relief mission to the countryin more than a decade.Authorities now are faced with the difficult task of gettingsupplies into the affected areas. More than 60 aftershocks joltedthe quake zone in northwestern Iran on Sunday, triggeringlandslides along one key relief route.Tehran radio said Sunday that 68 relief aircraft had landed atTehran's Mehrabad airport during a 24-hour period. Among them was aplane carrying medicine and other supplies from the United States.Another plane carrying U.S. government aid was due today.The shipment that arrived Sunday was the first of its kind to beaccepted by Iran since the hostage crisis of 1979-80, when 52Americans were held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.Two countries that also have suffered devastating earthquakes inrecent years, the Soviet Union and Mexico, were among those sendingassistance to help victims of Thursday's quake.Leaders of Iran's Arab neighbors, including Iraq, which waged aneight-year war with Iran, issued statements of sympathy and support.Pope John Paul II called on the international community to helpearthquake victims, asking for a real and generous demonstrationof solidarity with our brothers. Let us pray that their sufferingis alleviated.The Vatican was among the many international donors.Eleven planes from West Germany ferried in 145 tons of suppliesplus a field hospital with two medical teams. Nine flights arrivedfrom Turkey. The Spanish Red Cross sent medicines and food; Indiasent medicine. The Austrian Red Cross shipped tents, blankets andmedicine.Bernard Kouchner, the French secretary of state for humanitarianaction, arrived in Iran on Sunday to coordinate French assistanceand evaluate future needs, Radio France Inter said. The Frenchgovernment has sent a civil defense team of 195 people and 18search dogs along with at least 24 tons of equipment. TheSaudi-based 46-member Organization of the Islamic Conference, anumbrella organization for the world's estimated one billionMoslems, issued an urgent appeal to the international communityand especially Islamic countries and organizations to hasten withemergency aid for the Iranians ...AmeriCares, a private U.S. relief organization based in NewCanaan, Conn., flew in the 42 tons pounds of supplies that arrivedSunday.To be on the ground here in Tehran is a very special feeelingfor us, said Stephen M. Johnson, president of AmeriCares.A spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Developmentsaid a Red Cross charter flight carrying $225,000 worth of suppliesdonated by the U.S. government would arrive in Tehran this morning.Iran is believed to have influence with the Shiite Moslemextremists holding 16 Western hostages, including six Americans, inLebanon. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.The Soviet Union sent in medical teams and supplies from Sovietrepublics bordering Iran. More than 200 medical personnel arrivedfrom the Soviet Union, which also sent medical supplies, trucks,trailers, ambulances, cranes, buses and water tankers.The December 1988 earthquake in Soviet Armenia left at least25,000 people dead. Mexico, which lost at least 10,000 people in a1985 earthquake, is sending food, medical supplies and blankets,officials said Sunday.In Lebanon, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, saidits members were donating 10 percent of their salaries to help thevictims. That would amount to about $500,000, according toHezbollah sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Iran is deliberately underreporting the numberof casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of apolitical backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow thecountry's Islamic leadership say.The regime is very much fearful of public outrage, saidShahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks.As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denouncedIran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the streetfrom the White House.Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuringbetween 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale. Iran has told the UnitedNations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said hisorganization has received estimates closer to 100,000.Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquakevictims because its treasury has been spent in a war withneighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.They have been very late in assisting the people, he said.Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue forthe chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carriedsigns criticizing their native country.Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake,but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's strickenresidents.Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced peopleto live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.This regime has brought them nothing but devastation andmisery. This regime has devoted all of its resources to a senselesswar with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home, he said.A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire was declared last year after eightyears of the Iran-Iraq war.Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after ShahMohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeiniand militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66Americans hostage.The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April1980. The shah died in exile in July 1980, U.S. hostages were freedsix months later and Khomeini died last June.Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah buthad no part in organizing the Islamic republic.Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust theregime in Iran, Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated3,000 people attending the rally.There were many, many victims before this tragedy and thereare victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people ofthe United States, he said.Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but saidBush must make sure the assistance is channeled throughnon-government groups.The State Department said Friday that Iran was willing to acceptearthquake relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S.humanitarian organizations.Americans who rushed to donate money to help victims of theArmenian earthquake 18 months ago are responding more slowly tolast week's killer earthquake in Iran. But relief agencies saidthey expect contributions to pick up.There's a hierarchy of responsiveness, said Dick Colenso,associate executive director of World Concern, a private reliefagency based in Seattle. Something happens in Europe, there's avery large response, Asia, a pretty good responsdown to the Middle East ... thee. When you get dynamics change.Colenso said, however, that contributions will surge upwardas news spreads of the earthquake's destruction.As ... you get the disaster translated into the lives ofindividuals instead of mass numbers, people begin to respond. Theyrelate to that, he said.At least 50,000 people were reported killed and 200,000 injuredin the earthquake that struck Thursday.AmeriCares, a private agency based in New Canaan, Conn., broughtthe first shipment of supplies from the United States into Iran onSunday.The shipment was the first of its kind to be accepted by Iransince the hostage crisis of 1979-80, when 52 Americans were held atthe U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

His speeches tostudents at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei incentral China, where he was vice president, helped incite theprotests, party hard-liners said.Fang was expelled from the Communist Party in 1957, when he saidMarxist theory on physics was obsolete. In 1987, he was fired fromhis Hefei university posts. In between, in 1966, he was a victim ofthe Cultural Revolution purges and was sent to a communal farm forre-education.After the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the democracymovement, Fang and Li obtained refuge in the U.S. Embassy.An anti-American newspaper in Iran saidSunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tensof thousands of people in last week's earthquake.The criminal role of America in Iran's past became evidentonce again in the recent earthquake, the Jomhuri Islami said inan editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.Our people, even under the rubble, chant `Death to America'and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States ... eventhose hands stretched out to help, it said.It argued that by plundering Iran's oil and other resourcesfor 25 years, the United States had prevented the use of even asmall part of the national wealth for urban development projectsand advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems.Even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government byimposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots,halted the renovation of the country, the editorial added.The newspaper was implying that with these actions the UnitedStates had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safetymeasures.If the United States has real humanitarian objectives andintended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing,stop hatching plots, the newspaper said.It called on Iranians to reject relief offers by the UnitedStates and other governments whose hands are stained with theblood of the Iranian people.Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure ofhostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has said it would welcomerelief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitariangroups. The two nations have no diplomatic ties.The earthquake that devastated Iran earlyThursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleepin fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said.Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by somethingfalling on top of you, said Russ Needham, a geophysist with theU.S. Geological Survey that monitors ground motion around the world.The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the peoplewere in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interviewfrom Golden, Colo.At least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in thequake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands ofpeople in the rubble of their homes, Iranian officials said.Needham said most structures in that area are built of aceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, he said of theDec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people.A Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number offatalities on shoddily built buildings.The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, butThursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7.The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section ofcoastal Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plainof loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allowsstructures to collapse, he said.The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in thatarea, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, Needhamssaid.Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and thatthere have been many smaller quakes.Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred inIran during the last 30 years, Needhams said.A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capableof widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.","AP900622-0025,AP900625-0036,AP900623-0022,AP900626-0010,AP900624-0011,LA062390-0068,LA062290-0169,LA062590-0096,LA062290-0134,AP900621-0186","Iranian earthquake kills thousands; relief flights underway for injured,homeless","The massive earthquake, which struck northern Iran on June 20th, killed anestimated 36,000, injured thousands, and left 400,000 homeless.

The Iranian president appealed for international aid and the response was overwhelming, including assistance from the United States, the first such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. On the negative side, Iranian news media were slow to report on the disaster and the Iranian and U.S. government were blamed by their respective critics for the excessive casualties.","An earthquake hit Gilan and Zanjan provinces in northwestern Iran onJune 21, 1990 killing at least 50,000 people, injuring 200,000 andleaving 400,000 homeless.

Inc. andMiller Brewing Co., are gearing up to sell their beer with bystaging mock football games in television commercials inconjunction with Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans.Executives from both companies say they're attempting to takeadvantage of the weeks of hype surrounding the game. Bothbeermakers claim their packages are the largest Super Bowlpromotions ever, with each planning to spend upwards of $7 million.Anheuser Busch is staging a Bud Bowl II ad campaign thatculminates during the Jan. 28 Super Bowl, with a game featuringanimated teams of Budweiser and Bud Light beer bottles rattlingaround on a pint-sized football field. The first such game wasstaged during the last Super Bowl.We're starting a month earlier, we've added an extra promospot and we're going to have a lot more display materials in thestores, said Tom Sharbaugh, group brand director for Budweiser.Miller, based in Milwaukee, won't say exactly how much it isspending on its 12-week, pre-Super Bowl campaign centered on afootball game between a Tastes Great team and a LessFilling squad.Those teams will be made up of current and former NationalFootball League players such as Bert Jones, L.C. Greenwood and JoeKlecko.We're spending more than $7 million, I can tell you that,said Richard Burton, advertising manager for Lite beer. We'retalking about real-life talent.Miller's campaign culminates Jan. 14, two weeks before the SuperBowl, primarily because Anheuser Busch bought all the Super Bowltelevision spots allocated for beer advertising.Miller's television commercials already have started airing.Anheuser Busch will begin its ads this week with a spot featuringsports announcer Brent Musberger.Both companies also have fan participation promotions.Anheuser Busch expects to receive 400,000 to 500,000 scorecardsfrom fans who are being asked to write down the score of the BudBowl after each quarter. Fans who send in their scorecards willreceive a commemorative pin.Miller has a consumer sweepstakes offering expense-paid trips tothe Super Bowl.Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertisers to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend for an all-out bash. Along with getting seats for Sunday's game, the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel. The magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104,000 fans attending the Super Bowl. And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense. Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs. One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted. If a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 -- the going rate -- it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60. Even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a ""substantial and bona fide business discussion"" before, during or after the game, says Julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc. To take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough, Mr. Block says. And if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient. The tougher IRS rule, however, hasn't slowed ticket demand; even end-zone seats are fetching $500 each. ""Even if it weren't tax deductible, it'd be worth it,"" says Tom Foley, chairman of Bibb Co., a Macon, Ga., maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the National Football League team logos. Bibb is flying about 20 people -- mostly customers -- to the game. ""We get more earnings from the trip than the expense,"" says Mr. Foley. Some companies say they are making adjustments or at least educating their executives about the new rules. A spokesman for Adolph Coors & Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, said its tax advisers instructed executives that ""this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business."" Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game. Meals are now 80% deductible as long as business is discussed. Under the old law, meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest. Companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-Super Bowl banquet, since the new tax law has a ""banquet meeting exception."" Such meetings must have at least 40 persons, half of whom are away from home, and there must be a speaker. Executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the Super Bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor, says William J. Lipton, tax partner of the accounting firm Ernst & Whinney. If a host wants to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guests, Mr. Lipton says. One safety measure: Make a business-oriented speech, Mr. Block suggests. He also advises party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection. That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guests including business leaders, entertainment personalities and customers. Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, says the bash is tax deductible because ""our sales people will be there and business will be discussed."" He admits, however, ""We're not going to twist any arms. We're there to say thank-you to those who've given us business."" An IRS spokesman says more agents will be assigned to corporate audits of business-entertainment expenses this year. But IRS enforcement of the rules could be as difficult as blocking the New York Giants' Lawrence Taylor. ""As a practical matter, as long as people say they talked business at a Super Bowl party, how can the IRS dispute it?"" says Vickie King, a Price Waterhouse tax official. ""The only people who will get into trouble are those who don't keep receipts.""President Bush congratulated the San Francisco49ers on Friday and said they rewrote the record books withtheir Super Bowl victory. In turn he was presented with twoautographed balls and a jogging outfit.Let me congratulate you also on your victory, quarterback JoeMontana told Bush at a East Room reception. Montana said beinginvited to the White House means a lot to all of us and joked:Not very often do I get to see these guys in ties.Bush, surrounded by 49ers, told the team, With this, your thirdSuper Bowl title in eight years, you rewrote the record books andraised the game of football to a new level of excellence.And, to Montana, who drove the team to the winning touchdown on a92-yard drive late in the fourth quarter, Bush said: Joe, you onceagain showed your grace under pressure. I guess we all wonder why ittook so long.Bush was presented autographed balls by both Montana and widereceiver Jerry Rice, who won the game's Most Valuable Player award.That's the real thing from the Super Bowl, Rice said of theball he gave the president.Bush joked that he heard, there is a new TV series coming outbased on your Super Bowl performance  Miami Rice. Available inevery city in the country except one.

The higher viewership was made possible by the annualincrease in the number of homes with television.Given the expected blowout, the numbers are completelyunderstandable and we're happy to have a 39, said Susan Kerr,director of programming for CBS Sports. It's still a remarkablerating for prime time.The 49ers won by the biggest margin in Super Bowl history.Only the 1969 and 1968 Super Bowls had lower ratings; GreenBay's 33-14 victory over Oakland in 1968 got a 36.8. The firstSuper Bowl was in 1967.The highest-rated Super Bowl was in 1982, when the 49ers' 26-21victory over Cincinnati got a 49.1 on CBS.Last year's San Francisco-Cincinnati Super Bowl, won by the49ers 20-16, got a 43.5 rating and was seen in 39.3 million homes,according to Nielsen estimates.

But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

Thesailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq.Vickery, 33, was among four American sailors interviewed atHaifa's Rambam Hospital. He is from Jacksonville, Fla., is not farfrom Mayport, the Saragota's home port.Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water overthe stern in heavy seas, then capsized when it was hit by a bigwave.Vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he hadcracked his joke.All of a sudden, I saw water just come flying in, he said.And it was maybe two seconds, and the boat rolled right over.The 13-year veteran sailor found himself trapped in the ferry'scabin, frantically struggling to find a window as the ship sank.I started breathing in water and almost died, Vickery said.If I had been under the water maybe another 30 seconds, Iwouldn't be lying here right now. I'd be in one of those body bagsout there.When he made his way to the surface he found guys floatingeverywhere, screaming and yelling like chaos.Despite his own predicament, he grabbed a struggling fellowsailor by the collar and dragged him toward a floating, plasticfoam life ring. One rescue boat, already overloaded, passed by andthrew life preservers.In what seemed like an hour, another boat came, also full.So they just dragged us through the water back to theSaratoga, and I was a real happy person to see those guys snatchingme up, he said.As Vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by waterinhalation, his hospital roommate, Seaman Michael Benjamin, 19, ofSan Antonio, Texas, was recovering from a neck injury suffered whena rescue boat hit him while he was in the water.Both were wearing blue hospital pajamas and, when they walked tothe visiting room's balcony could see the Saratoga anchored outsidethe Haifa harbor.Benjamin, who has been in the navy for just a year, said theferry had been jostled in heavy seas.As we were going on the waves, I just noticed one that wasbigger than normal and then another one that was bigger thannormal, he said. The next thing I know, all I saw coming in waswater, he said.Benjamin said he dove from the ferry, then had to swimfrantically to get away from the suction of the sinking boat.Clinging to a foam plastic float, he was passed by one rescueboat and hit by a second.I looked around and I see this big hull coming at me and wewere all yelling, but I guess the ship didn't see us, he said.I was trying to get out of the way, but I got hit by the ship.Dazed, Benjamin stripped off his jacket, shirt and shoes andkept treading water until he found a piece of driftwood to clingto.I was scared, he admitted. I was having a hard timestaying up in the water.A rescue ship picked him up, he estimated, about a half hour to45 minutes later.Two other men interviewed at Rambam Hospital identifiedthemselves as Technician John Richards, 31, of Twin Lake, Mich.,and Airman Lamont Jones, 20, of Claremont, Va.Both were breathing with difficulty despite gas masks.Richards recalled seeing a large wave and feeling the shipheeling to one side.All I can remember thinking is, `Oh my God, it's sinking,' andthen I was scrambling for my life, he said faintly.They also want to know why the ferry strayed outside standard navigationalchannels.

23,d100e,"John Lennon's worldwide message of peace wasdelivered Tuesday as his song Imagine was played simultaneouslyfor 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would havebeen his 50th birthday.A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dreamtogether is reality. Happy birthday, John. The world is bettertoday for sharing a time with you, Yoko Ono said at a UnitedNations ceremony before the playing of Imagine.The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in ataped message that served as an introduction to the music.We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have. ... Think ofyour children. Do you want them to be killed or don't you? Andthat's the choice we have in front of us. War or peace, saidLennon, whose son Sean turned 15 Tuesday.None of the other Beatles were at the United Nations, but atribute came from Lennon's old songwriting partner, Paul McCartney,who released a live version of the Beatles' tune Birthday. Thesong, originally on the White Album, was the firstLennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in1969.The release date and John's birthday is just a happycoincidence, but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate, saidMcCartney, 47.Other observances were held from Liverpool to Moscow to LosAngeles.In Lennon's hometown in England, fans gathered at the formersite of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles were discovered.Among those attending was Lennon's 71-year-old uncle, CharlieLennon.When asked how his nephew would have reacted to the ceremonies,he said: If he had been alive I doubt he would have come and evenif he had, he would sat with me in the pub and had a good laugh.On the West Coast, about 50 people - part of an estimated 1billion people worldwide who had access to the event - stood nearLennon's star on the Walk of Fame and listened to the Imaginebroadcast:Imagine all the people, living life in peaceYou may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only oneI hope some day you'll join usAnd the world will live as one.His spirit still lives in all of us whose lives have beentouched with him, Ono said of her late husband.I would like us to remember and celebrate his birthday as aday of love, because he was a man of love, and because love is muchneeded at this time in our lives.Ono was greeted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N.secretary-general. During her brief remarks, Ono also quoted a linefrom another of Lennon's songs, Happy Xmas (War is Over):Remember, war is over if you want it.More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countriesbroadcast the 10-minute event. U.S. Armed Forces television andradio beamed it to 80-plus other countries. MTV televised theImagine video in 25 countries, said Andrea Smith, a spokeswomanfor the network.In Moscow, about 1,000 Soviets gathered at the Moscow ElectricalLamp Factory's cultural hall to listen to Lennon's music, snap uphis albums and posters and reflect on his life.Even the staid state television program Vremya got into theact. An anchorman, reporting on the worldwide birthday bash,described Imagine as an anthem of peace. The broadcastended with an instrumental version of Yesterday.Not so long ago, the Beatles' music was banned in the SovietUnion. In 1964, one commentator warned that these bugs canswiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.Lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan outside his Manhattanapartment building on Dec. 8, 1980.On the spot where Lenin once spoke, the focusTuesday was on Lennon.Official newspapers, which once denounced the Beatles as harmfulpests from the decadent West, joined a worldwide celebration andran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon, who would haveturned 50 on Tuesday. State radio broadcast his music andinterviews about him.Two concerts devoted to the songwriter, guitarist and singer,who was shot to death in 1980, were held in Moscow.Even the staid state television program Vremya got into act.An anchorman, more accustomed to reading official government news,reported on the worldwide Lennon birthday bash and called his songImagine, an anthem of peace. The broadcast ended with aninstrumental version of Yesterday playing as temperatures fromaround the nation rolled across the screen.The celebration was a dramatic turnabout from Sovietauthorities' repression of Beatles fans and supression of theirmusic in earlier times. Their music was banned and the Soviet presscondemned them. A 1964 article, for instance, commented, Thesebugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.About 1,000 Soviets, mostly second generation Beatles fans,flocked to the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall innortheastern part of the city to rejoice in Lennon's music. Aplaque outside the hall reminded Beatles fans that Lennon's nearnamesake, Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, hadspoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919.Inside, fans listened to recordings of Lennon's music, attendeda concert of about a dozen Soviet rock bands, bought his albums andposters and reflected on his life.He's like a hero, a symbol for every person: a symbol ofhonesty, talent, devotion to his ideals, notion of love, equalitybetween people and goodness, said Irina Dykomkina, the21-year-old secretary of the Sgt. Pepper's Club, a Soviet Beatlesfan club formed two years ago.Lennon's music, she said, crosses borders easily.His music is so sincere, it's so understandable, even topeople who don't know English. They feel the music.Andrei Trushkin, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda - theCommunist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday toLennon - said he appeals to Soviet youth in part because he was arebel, like many of them, and was a difficult teen-ager.The cops would have locked him up many times, said Trushkin,who helped organize the concert.Tuesday's concert opened in the spirit of a birthday party.Balloons floated down from the balconies as a tape of Lennon'ssong, Starting Over, played. The stage was adorned with apainting of Lennon and life-size cardboard cutouts of the Fab Fourin front of the British flag.Oorah! Oorah! shouted the audience, which included a fewsoldiers in uniform. Onstage, the groups Sprint, Quiet Hour andOptimal Variant played in Beatles style but were joined by a groupthat didn't quite fit in the genre, an American-style countryensemble that wore plaid vests and performed Night Train toMemphis.When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman begandigging into The Lives of John Lennon, his first move was tomail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.She was Numero Uno, you've got to start with her. I sent her asincere letter, because at that time I was a true believer inrock's greatest love story. ... I told her, `I'm in your corner,'Goldman recalled.Ono never responded. And after 1,200 interviews and 6{ years,the dream was over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the Greataltered.Expecting the best, Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst:a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes ofrock 'n' roll, tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time.That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters,family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it alsotaught Goldman  who says he is a John Lennon fan  a hard lesson.It doesn't pay to meet your idols. Just enjoy them; don't tryto see the reality, Goldman said. My books are a cold dose ofreality. You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goescold.Goldman, whose past tell-all biographies dealt with ElvisPresley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry fromthe music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, PaulMcCartney.My books are bad for business, Goldman said in a phoneinterview from Munich, West Germany. They're bad for Paul'sbusiness, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rockbusiness. Those people have to hate me.Myth-shattering is a not a bad thing, Goldman said. For example,he cites Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Gracelandin 1965.John was very hooked into Elvis. Elvis was his measure ofsuccess, said Goldman. And the myth of Elvis: awesome. But thereality of Elvis: a mess.Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney,Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defamebecause he's no longer around to answer the allegations.You can't say John lacks for defenders. And Yoko isn't dead.Colonel Parker (Presley's manager) isn't dead. Ninety-five percentof the people in my books aren't dead. They can do something aboutit, said Goldman, his voice quickening.This business of making it easy for defending myself isinsane. I'm the target of scores of attacks. I can't imagine aharder thing for an author.Those attacks don't really bother him, unless they come fromsomeone who hasn't read The Lives of John Lennon, Goldman said.A lot of people already made up their minds. They hear AlbertGoldman, John Lennon, homosexuality  bang, let him have it! Iresent people commenting on a book they haven't read, includingYoko, the author said.Ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to thebook. She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennonstotally fiction and brought out Lennon's sons, Julian and12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography.These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honestdocumentaries, when they're in-house documentaries, said Goldman,who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show. She takes nochances. This was another no-chance Yoko.As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse byYoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness,Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennonpresented by those who knew him.My thesis is John Lennon was a divided mind. Every yin had ayang, said Goldman. There is nothing more natural than for Johnto try the other side (sexually). That's just the kind of guy hewas. He wanted to try everything once.A biography that portrays John Lennon as adrug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool toNew York City is totally fiction, Yoko Ono said in a nationalradio broadcast.It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license. I don'tsee John in there ... It's a very dramatically described something,but it's not about John, Ono said Wednesday night in her firstbroadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counterGoldman's The Lives of John Lennon, which presents theex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump hiswife.As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snortedheroin up to the time of Lennon's death. Goldman also charges shewas responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan,had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on adivorce as Lennon.Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and counteredthrough taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees thatGoldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.It's totally fiction, Yoko said during the hour-longprogram, which opened with Lennon's song, Gimme Some Truth, andcoincided with the book's national release Wednesday.These people in this book are not us. It's not John and me,Ono continued. It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hitback. ... For some reason this book is attempting to rob both Johnand I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to.The Ono interview was taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where theLennons lived  and Yoko still lives with their son, Sean. Lennonwas murdered by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota on Dec. 8,1980.The interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood OneNetwork; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said an exact figure on how manystations picked up the broadcast was not available.Also appearing were Sean and Lennon other son, Julian. Ono wasinterviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described inGoldman's book as a spy for Yoko  a charge Mintz denied during theshow.It is, for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies,untruths ... The whole thing is just sickening, said Julian, whoalso refuted Goldman's tales of Lennon as a violent father.Mintz read excerpts from the book to Yoko, who then responded tothe allegations point by point. She denied that Lennon washomosexual; that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota withhis son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll HowardHughes.She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a$5,000-a-week habit.The book has already drawn angry responses from friends ofLennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involvingLennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott ofthe book.After Yoko's rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900-digittelephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurateportrayal of the Lennons' life. Results were not expected untillater today.Goldman, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews for his Lennonbook, has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruceand Elvis Presley.Thousands of John Lennon fans, sometoo young to remember the Beatles, swayed and sang along with songsincluding his anthem Imagine at a hometown tribute.It's a great day, isn't it? Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, askedthe crowd. I think John would be happy, too.At the close of the concert, she and son Sean, 14, wept andhugged some of the musicians, who included B.B. King, Joe Cocker,Roberta Flack, the Moody Blues, Hall and Oates, Wet Wet Wet andRandy Travis.However, the turnout was only 15,000, according to policeestimates. Organizers had hoped for about 45,000. Tickets were $41for the charity benefit concert, which featured a program ofBeatles and Lennon songs.The concert was televised in Britain and was to be rebroadcastworldwide in October in a 50th birthday tribute to Lennon a decadeafter his death.Cyndi Lauper, in a white minidress, sang Hey Bulldog, andDave Edmunds, backed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra,did the Beatles classic, A Day in the Life.Soul singer Al Green was the opening act. His version of AllYou Need is Love, turned into a singalong with the crowd, andKylie Minogue did Help.American actor Christopher Reeve was among the hosts of theconcert.Ex-Beatles George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr didnot attend, but McCartney and Starr made taped contributions.On tape, Starr performed I Call Your Name and said, Johnhad the biggest heart of any man I have ever met to this day. Hewas a giving, loving, caring human being. He was crazy as well somedays  but the guy would give you his heart.Lennon's co-songwriter, Paul McCartney, said on his tape:Hello Liverpool, scene of many great memories, John, me and therest of the lads. The Beatles were raised in Liverpool and gottheir start in the Merseyside bars.All the musicians assembled on stage for Give Peace aChance, as the enthusiastic audience sang along, waved andclapped.The concert closed with a recording of Lennon singingImagine, while giant screens showed a video featuring John andYoko.Proceeds are to go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity foundedby the Lennons in 1978, two years before Lennon was shot to deathin front of his apartment in New York City.Lennon was slain on Dec. 8, 1980, when he was 40. The confessedkiller, Mark Chapman, is serving a life prison sentence.Cynthia Lennon joins the throng denouncing thenew, unauthorized biography of her late former husband, JohnLennon, as written by a money-hungry author capitalizing onuntruths.People who write books like this, it is for greed, and as faras I'm concerned, they're gravediggers, no more, no less, Mrs.Lennon says on the CBS show 60 Minutes scheduled for broadcastSunday evening.Grave robbers, body snatchers, you name it, they are it.The biography by Albert Goldman, The Lives of John Lennon,depicts the former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugswho raged his way from Liverpool to New York. It was released Sept.14.Goldman, who defends his Lennon book and said it is based on1,200 interviews, also has written controversial biographies ofcomedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.Lennon was murdered outside his Upper West Side home on Dec. 8,1980, by Mark David Chapman.All I know and all the people that love John know that we hadour years (and) that nobody, no film, no book will ever completewhat went on in our lives. That's our part of our hearts that hasto stay with us, must not be public, Mrs. Lennon said.I love John. I've always loved John because he was my firstlove. But, I mean, I've loved him in different ways. I love hismemory. I loved what he did. I understood his madness, his phases.I just feel that I understood.The couple divorced a few months before Lennon married Yoko Onoin 1969.Ms. Ono already has trashed the book, calling it totallyfiction in a nationwide broadcast that coincided with the releaseof the book. She too was interviewed on the 60 Minutes show,entitled The Two Mrs. Lennons.These people in this book are not us. It's not John and me,Ono said in the taped radio broadcast.Cynthia and John's son, Julian Lennon, also denounced the bookon the radio taping, calling it lies, untruths, and adding thatthe whole thing is just sickening.Sean Lennon, the son of Yoko and John who is now 12, added hisvoice on the CBS broadcast, rebutting charges that his father wasinattentive to parenting.I think he did a lot of fathering in the five years that Iknew him, Sean says. He spent so much time with me not just athome, but everywhere, you know.Say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, ""The Lives of John Lennon"" (Morrow, $22.95), but you've got to hand it to him: This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger. Most best-selling pop biographers play it safe: They choose a celeb of respectable, not to say pristine, reputation, and then they proceed to blacken it, preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealings, even, in some cases, dyslexia. The resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public, which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions. A can't-miss formula, surely. Albert Goldman's previous victim in the genre was Elvis Presley. Now Mr. Presley was, if you'll forgive the expression, a fat target for a writer of Mr. Goldman's methods. His title notwithstanding, the ""King of Rock 'n' Roll"" was in truth more a creature of the old show biz, a star whose wholesome image, carefully created by P.R. wizards, was ripe for debunking. But in choosing Mr. Lennon as his next target, Mr. Goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable. For apart from his puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he gave was his own squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on. By his own accounting, then, Mr. Lennon was not about to dethrone Ward Cleaver as the all-American dad. His public loved him in spite of it all -- or perhaps because of it all. Mr. Lennon grew to celebrity during a time when such transgressions as intemperance and adultery (quaint terms!) were losing their social sting. His candor -- if that's what it was, and not simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything. And so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attacks his subject. The leitmotif of Mr. Lennon's confessions was that his worst days were behind him, and that with Yoko Ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity. Now Mr. Goldman is here to announce: He didn't tell you the half of it. Hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness, percolating with the ""scoops"" that have by now been widely publicized in People magazine, ""West 57th"" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had a thing for young boys; that his marriage to Ms. Ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit. The squalid revelations dribble out like a chemical leak, sliming up every page. Remarkably, then, the sleazemonger's art has triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon is even worse than John Lennon's John Lennon. A great deal of this muck manages to splash onto Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portrays as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting Mr. Lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth. Mr. Goldman, alas, allows to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well. The keepers of the Lennon flame have of course been quick to point this out. Ms. Ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrities, they have hit the talk shows to display their wounds. And Rolling Stone magazine, long the house organ for the Lennon publicity machine, recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book, which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic. Criticizing ""The Lives of John Lennon"" for insufficient respect to the fallen Beatle's legacy is rather off the point -- like condemning Charles Manson for his bad table manners. The book may indeed be inaccurate, as critics have charged. But one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate Mr. Goldman's book. There is, for starters, the sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive of the grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop songs as ""pieces,"" as though they were concerti. There is his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- toward drugs, sex, music -- that gives him license to second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. And there is the awkward organization, in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on Mr. Lennon, while major events are skipped over lightly because -- there goes the advance! -- they might reveal Mr. Lennon in a flattering light. All of which indicates why ""The Lives of John Lennon"" is such a wretched book: not because it makes a good man look bad, but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man -- whether a good man or a bad one, we laymen will probably never know -- look bad. John Lennon, while he was alive, did enough of that himself to satisfy all but the lowest appetites. ---Mr. Ferguson is assistant managing editor of The American Spectator.At this point, Lennon says he became a househusband to theirchild while Yoko ran the family business. The arrangement continueduntil Lennon told the woman he called Mother it was time tomake music again. Double Fantasy followed just before John'sdeath, although it was not to be Lennon's swan song.Bruce Springsteen has released three albums since 1980; MichaelJackson two. In contrast, Lennon - or, more accurately, Ono - hasreleased five albums: Milk and Honey, Menlove Ave., themovie soundtrack Imagine, the John Lennon - Live in NewYork collection and a boxed CD collection for Christmas '90.In addition, The Lost Lennon Tapes, featuring hours ofunreleased Lennon music, became a popular syndicated radio program.Ono has overseen all these projects.People ask me, `What would he have done in the '80s?' I say,`Let's talk about what he HAS done in the '80s,' because he hasdefinitely, she said. In spirit, I think he's alive, and we'regetting the benefit.Others charge Ono with turning her memories into millionswithout concern for Lennon's image. A Fame magazine profile deridedher as The Merry Widow; the now-defunct weekly 7 Days describedher as the decade's premier celebrity civil defendant.Greed, insensitivity, egomania. None of Ono's alleged faults areapparent in an interview.In October, a barefoot Ono greeted a visitor to the Dakota in ahigh-ceilinged first-floor room with white carpet and black onyxwalls. Curled up on a chair, she serenely sipped herbal tea from amug decorated with a Lennon drawing of John and Yoko with theinscription, Grow Old With Me.The mug is one of an assortment of Lennon collectibles available(by appointment only) from Bag One Arts Inc., the entity thatcontrols reproductions of Lennon's art work.Some of that black on white artwork - which includes doodlesjotted down on napkins, the margins of letters or stray scraps ofpaper - has been colorized or redone in neon at Ono's order.People would ask if we had anything in color, says LynneClifford, who runs Bag One for Yoko. And Yoko said, `I feelconfident enough to add the color myself. So she took the originalsketches and we made plates and she added colors.Lithographs that sold for $400 four years ago have increased asmuch as 10 times in value, she says, and new ones cost between $600and $700.Although Bag One's gallery a few blocks from the Dakota dealsprimarily in lithographs, it also sells the collectibles, including$3 laminated bags that bear Lennon's drawings.Yoko wanted everybody to be able to walk away withsomething, explained Clifford.Where does all the money go?Yoko is very funny about (saying) where the money goes. ...But some goes to the Spirit Foundation, she said. The foundation,established by Lennon and Ono before John's death, has contributedto causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children tobulletproof vests for police officers.Is there anything that will never bear Lennon's sketch-work?Socks, Clifford said. Yoko said she couldn't imagine peoplewalking around on John's drawings.Back at the Dakota, Ono receives a familiar question: Is thisall commercialism? Has the iconoclastic ex-Beatle been sold out?She laughs.No. I didn't sell out John. And I'm sure John would be happyI'm still keeping him out there. ... There's a commercial aspect,yes, but I mean, why not? I was a partner, and I still feel thatI'm a partner.Dozens of fans of rock legend andformer Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturdayfor a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.Liverpool's mayor, Dorothy Gavin, led Lennon devotees who laidwreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of The Beatles in the city'sCavern Walks shopping center.The center was built on the original site of the Cavern Club,made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and hasbecome a place of pilgrimage.Give peace a chance, the title of one of singer-songwriterLennon's greatest hits, was the theme for the day.Many friends and followers of Lennon were present, includingFather Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in TheBeatles' l966 hit song Eleanor Rigby.On Friday, a small group of invited guests had gathered atLiverpool's Beatles Museum to watch Mrs. Gavin unveil a plaquemarking the 10th anniversary of Lennon's death.John was always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 yearsLiverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatlescame from Liverpool, said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after theunveiling.It is right that a world figure like Lennon should berecognized at last, said Coleman, author of John Lennon.Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartmentin New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording sessionon Dec. 8, 1980, when Lennon was shot to death by Mark DavidChapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph onlyhours before. Lennon was 40.A spokesman for the Lennon family said Ms. Ono and the couple'sson, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversaryprivately.Journalist Andy Peebles, the last person to interview Lennonbefore he was shot, said in an interview with Sky satellitetelevision news:Ten years on, it's a ghastly feeling to thinkthat you had spent ... seven hours ... with somebody you have beena fan of for years, and I think I left ... thinking `This is great,he's in really good shape.'Peebles said late in 1980 that Lennon had just recovered from aperiod when he had gone off the rails and his relationship withMs. Ono had suffered. But (when I saw him) they'd had the baby,Sean had been born, and everything was great.John Lennon spent much of a three-year spantucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus positionwith his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according toa biography of the slain Beatle.An excerpt from the book, The Lives of John Lennon byjournalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflatteringportrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.The book is scheduled to be published later this month byWilliam Morrow & Co. Inc.Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon could not bemore remote.Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, includingtime spent with his son, Sean, Lennon is back here in his room,alone and silent.The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult lifeas an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived asperfection. The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965,Goldman writes, when some fool described him in print as the `fatBeatle.' That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that thewound has never healed.Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backlessslippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.The 719-page biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-weekheroin habit in 1979. She reportedly snorted the drug.According to the book, Lennon also took heroin and consumed agreat deal of LSD.I must have taken a thousand trips, the book quotes Lennonas saying. I just ate it all the time like candy.Goldman spent more than six years researching the book,interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, whowas murdered eight years ago in New York.Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Musicin the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life:He was to play on John Lennon's new album.Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy takingcare of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas. Butin 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return tothe studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.It was more than a superstar session. Afterall, Lennon gave nopress conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts. Rare photosoccasionally emerged and he looked different in each one (Lennonjokingly referred to himself as Greta Hughes and HowardGarbo).Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as anengineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist HughMcCracken and other New York-based sessions players. Recording wasto take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero. He didn't knowhim and was nervous about working with him. The drummer guessed hewas something like the intense, irreverent young man of the moviesHelp! and A Hard Day's Night. Lennon was those things - andmore.His personality seemed so consistent with all we had everheard about John Lennon, said Newmark, who still lives in NewYork and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.His straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as thestories and images we had created.

24,d097e,"While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph windroared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it ventedon his beloved, 300-year-old city.Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston'shistoric City Hall through Thursday night as the area's worsthurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the CivilWar began.Late in the day, there was hope Hugo might spare Charleston. Butthe storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight towardthis city, which had survived a number of near misses from greatstorms in recent years.From the moment it became apparent Hugo might strike theSoutheast coast, many Charlestonians conceded that, this time, theirnumber was up.As Hugo's wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting thewindows, reporters wandered in and out of Riley's office. On hisdesk several candles burned as insurance against the inevitable lossof power.Later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof rippedoff and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the CityCouncil chamber. Phone and electric service to the city command postwas knocked out.During it all, Riley kept in close contact with the NationalWeather Service. As the eye of the storm passed, he took reportersonto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at thedamage.The initial view, sketched out in the glow of flashlights, wasunsettling: The tin roof was tossed in the gutter, slate tiles werescattered on the ground. Bricks, sticks and leaves littered thestreet.This is the eye of the hurricane. I've never been in one and Ihope I'm never in one again, Riley said. It's scarcely a latesummer breeze.As the storm died before dawn, Riley was out on the streets againin a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment ofthe damage.Serious but fixable, the mayor concluded.Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages. AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster. When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million. It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise ofseveral hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to fleethe South Carolina coast.But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions andforecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in thosemodels, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, butforecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time forevacuation.Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good ideawhere Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in atimely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting theintensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricanejust hours before it slammed into Charleston.It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer models for that, McAdie said.We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minuteincrease in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting toolswere reports from aircraft or ships.We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say ourforecasts were less accurate, Clark said.In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites toobtain a global weather picture. Information from the satellite isused to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models thattelevision viewers see every night.Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at theNational Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes toaccount for current weather conditions and the position of thehurricane.To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyzesupercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similarstorms and the current path of the hurricane.Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the MassachussettsInstitute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.Congress and the American people are suffering from thecollective delusion that our data problems have been solved bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enoughinformation about the wind and temperatures that affect ahurricane's path.Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanescomes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have to remember that those models used are only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of theforecaster to predict the storm's path.Residents took forecasters at their wordwhen they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number ofdeaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthyrespect, authorities said.The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives inSouth Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, whichbore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.We just feel very thankful about that, said Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousands of people who were in the sheltersand the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland werepotential victims of injury and death.Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring thehurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuationwarnings.The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away,and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've had so many close calls, said Gary Garnet, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service.But this storm was very, very strong, he said. This timethey realized it.Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headedfor shelters.Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed upInterstate 26 toward Columbia.Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding thewarnings.It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse, he said.You've just got to say nice things about the people.Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-wearyCharlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no otherstorms brewing.There's nothing to worry about out there, he said.Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents insoutheastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.This is a disaster staring us right in the eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston,where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and causedutility transformers to explode.All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we havetaken have been sufficient, Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in onthe city. I just hope and pray we can get through this without anyloss of life.By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston. The roofcracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that haswithstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into thepaneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the commandpost was knocked out.Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, andabout three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle ofPalms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of theNational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135mph.Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severeflooding as it moved up the East Coast. The storm posed a 19 percentchance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hittingBoston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resorttowns themselves. Power lines and trees were downed in some spotsand water flooded roads. Stop lights and neon lights were knockedout in Myrtle Beach.One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,' said AmyGarrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs,palmetto fronds and chunks of bark. Businesses were closed andclasses at public schools and universities canceled. Riley orderedresidents of one-story homes to evacuate.Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients wellenough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room foremergency patients, officials said.About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the stateas of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220miles northwest of here.We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in sidedoors, said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at theConway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach. We tried to postguards at the doors, but people were still coming in.American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the numberof evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., whoappealed for help.Right now the Red Cross is sheltering tens of thousands ofpeople all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course is at the sametime that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and theother Caribbean islands.We're beginning to feel the squeeze. Our resources are verytight. Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest reliefoperations of the decade.At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degreesnorth and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. Thehurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North andSouth Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next twodays, according to the hurricane center.The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said. A hurricane warningwas in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane onthe Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,which indicated it could cause extreme damage.It strengthened more than we thought it would, Sheets said,adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up theAppalachians.The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm'stidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed anormal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.On top of that will be waves, Sheets said earlier, and inmany places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept cleanoff.It's taken the devastation caused byHurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debtbetween two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston israising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.After Kingston, then New York's capital, was burned in October1777 by the British, New York Gov. George Clinton received a letterfrom South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston. The letter includednearly 1,000 New York pounds to help Kingston residents get throughtheir crisis.This money has been received for the charitable purpose ofalleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of thetown of Kingston, who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced topoverty and want, Livingston wrote on March 31, 1778.Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter whenHurricane Hugo ravaged the Carolinas last week. I figured theyhelped us, we should do something for them, Ford said.On Wednesday, a local Red Cross chapter began collectingdonations for victims of the hurricane.A lot of people have been calling, asking to send donationsdown there, said Susan Lawlor, executive director of the UlsterCounty Chapter of the Red Cross.On Tuesday, New York state sent two airplanes full of food,clothing and water to parts of the Caribbean ravaged by Hugo. A NewYork National Guard C-5A cargo plane also left Tuesday to pick upequipment in Mississippi and take it to Puerto Rico.Another cargo plane was scheduled to leave Stewart Air ForceBase in Newburgh, taking 70 tons of food, water and other suppliesto Puerto Rico.This historic city has survived theravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all inHurricane Hugo.The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into CharlestonThursday night.This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which fewpeople who have lived all their lives in Charleston haveexperienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston sinceHurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, bothnatural and man-made.The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado torethrough the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causingan estimated $2 million in property damage.Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures liningquaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861.The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and anynumber of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestoniansof refinement as September gales.But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on thehot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what somefolks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, theearthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildingsand tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets.In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitorsannually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby finesand beaches.Charleston has received international acclaim as home to SpoletoFestival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive artsfestival.Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say. The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow. ""Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record,"" said one official, far surpassing the $752.5 million insurers paid out after Frederick ripped through several Gulf Coast states in 1979. The impact on premium rates could be minimal for now, analysts expect, because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area -- for homes and autos. Most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future. In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers haven't had to dip into these funds. And since Hugo also stormed through the Caribbean, foreign insurers are at risk for some of the damage on those islands. Yet, some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months. Rates have been falling since late 1986. Udayan Ghose at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believes these reasons might cause rates to edge higher by mid-1990. For the time being, the losses from Hugo ""will be substantial, but they won't be something the industry can't handle,"" said Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James & Co., a New York-based insurance broker. For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimates it will pay claims totaling more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses. Nationwide Insurance Co., a mutual company based in Columbus, Ohio, said Hugo ""is the single largest claims disaster"" it has seen in its 63-year history. The company, which is the largest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and No. 3 in South Carolina, has already received 16,000 claims from the stricken region. Claims could total $100 million, a spokesman said. For some insurers, Hugo was a double-whammy. New York-based Continental Corp., which is a big insurer in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, said it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter, reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane. ""Hugo will be particularly costly to us,"" said John P. Mascotte, Continental's chairman. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which has extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit, and USF&G Corp. in Baltimore, a big insurer in the Carolina region, could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings, analysts said. Some of USF&G's losses hit very close home -- its Charleston office was destroyed by the hurricane. Both USF&G and Cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge; USF&G said it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of losses, and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses. Hugo could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at Travelers Corp., Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., according to industry analysts. Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believes that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough ""financial pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends,"" to compel them to boost premium rates right away. He explained that in the first six months of this year, net income for the industry declined slightly from 1988, but insurance companies were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity. He also noted that the industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently at $125 billion, is also plentiful. Generally, insurers can book about $3 of premiums for every $1 of surplus. Right now, premiums total about $200 billion, he said. An official at Nationwide Insurance noted that the company has $1 of surplus for every $2 of insurance that it writes. Insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses. Michael Lewis at Dean Witter Reynolds said losses from Hugo could be big enough to ""temporarily"" increase reinsurance rates. Although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some companies, the losses they must still cover could hurt third-quarter results. Niagara Exchange Corp., based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit faces as a result of the hurricane. State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance. It believes its reserves are plentiful enough to absorb its losses, a spokesman said.","AP890922-0119,WSJ890928-0084,AP890922-0167,AP890925-0054,LA092189-0225,AP890922-0007,LA092789-0093,AP890928-0099,AP890922-0049,WSJ890927-0018","South Carolina Coast Evacuation Before ""Killer Storm"" Hugo Saves Lives","The insurance industry expects Hugo, the Category 4 hurricane that struck the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, to be the costliest storm ever.

Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion, by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area, but insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims.","Hurricane Hugo approached the Carolina coast on Sept. 21, 1989 with its windspeed up to 125 mph and threatened to hit between Savannah, GA and Charleston, S.C. It hit Charleston head-on with winds of 135 mph and then proceeded northwestward hitting other population centers rather than heading up the coast or out to sea as expected. Fortunately Hurricane forecasters analyzing computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane made an accurate educated guess as to the point of landfall in time for threatened residents to evacuate. As a result, only 17 deaths resulted in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston which took the brunt of the storm. Charleston had been through many hard times in its 300- year history, but Hugo was by far the worst hurricane in its experience. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion but insurers were confident that they could handle all claims. Disaster aid came to Charleston from an unexpected source. Kingston, New York  raised funds to aid Charleston in thanks for 1,000 New York pounds sent by the South Carolina governor in 1778 to help the citizens of Kingston after it was burned by the British.",,,,

We are still hurting. It makes usmore compassionate for these people, the principal said.Eveline Higginbotham, the third-grade teacher in whose classroomthe two little girls died, said the California tragedy just bringsit all back again.I'm just in shock, she said.Within hours of the schoolyard shootingsthat left five children and the gunman dead and 30 wounded Tuesday,dozens of translators rushed to assist the many Southeast Asianparents who arrived at the hospital desperate for word of theiryoungsters.I would imagine it is absolute panic. They are not sure whathappened, not sure what's going on around them, said Laura Dixon,of the Charterhouse Center refugee program, in Stockton, describingthe scene translators found when they arrived at San Joaquin CountyGeneral Hospital.Many of the parents speak no English and were unable to askwhether their children were among those killed or wounded when aheavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded Cleveland ElementarySchool and opened fire before taking his own life.They do have people on staff at the hospital, but they are sooverloaded they need every extra person they can secure, saidDixon, whose organization began calling throughout Stockton forvolunteers speaking Southeast Asian languages. About a dozentranslators were sent to the county hospital, after officials therecalled for help.In recent years, thousands of Southeast Asians have settled inStockton, drawn in part by the farming and fishing that flourish inthe area. School officials said 60 percent of the children wereSoutheast Asian refugees  either from Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.All five of the children killed were of this background,authorities said.A Stockton woman who runs an after-school program teachingEnglish to Cambodian refugees dispatched 25 translators, includingvolunteers from all over the city, to the school and the hospital,Dixon said.The San Joaquin County Mental Health Department told Dixon agrief center might be established at Charterhouse to help survivors,whose recovery will be complicated by the language barrier.Charterhouse is funded by the Episcopal Church and privatedonations.Here is a profile of the gunman who took the lives of fivechildren at a Stockton, Calif., school Tuesday. It is based oninformation from police and relatives, and on background reported bythe Sacramento Bee newspaper.Grieving relatives and friends gatheredat memorial services Saturday to mourn the five school childrenslain by a camouflage-garbed, suicidal drifter.Although there are some people in the United States who do badthings, most of the people in the United States do good things,said Patricia Busher, principal of Cleveland Elementary School,where the killings and the woundings of 29 students and one teacherhappened last Tuesday.The tragedy that occurred at our school could have happenedanywhere. There is no way to protect us from this kind of tragedy... this senseless tragedy. In time, some of the cutting edge of thepain will go away, Busher said.Her speech, at a memorial service attended by 200 people for thefour Cambodian children killed, was translated as she spoke into theCambodian language.Tragedy has followed you, state Sen. John Garamendi told thefamilies, refugees from a country where more than 1 million peoplewere killed in executions and enforced hardship after a 1975communist takeover.The service, held in Central Methodist Church, was for 8-year-oldOeun Lim, 9-year-old Rathanan Or, 8-year-old Ram Chun and 6-year-oldSokhim An.During the morning, a Catholic funeral mass and burial were heldfor 6-year-old Thuy Tran, daughter of Vietnamese refugees.Another memorial service for the four Cambodians was plannedSunday at a mortuary.Gov.

Three children were discharged Friday.Stockton police said they have located all of Purdy's closerelatives, except for his mother, identified as 43-year-old KathySnyder.

Gov. George Deukmejian was to attend Monday'sservices.Purdy was buried Friday in nearby Lodi, said his grandmother,Julia Chumbley. He was interred following a service at CherokeeMemorial Cemetery, which several of his relatives attended, she said.Fourteen of the wounded students were still hospitalized, butmost were reported in improved conditions.At Cleveland School, about three-quarters of the school's 970pupils had returned to classes by Friday, about three times thenumber who attended Wednesday, but it was anything but a routineschool day.Counselors and school psychologists were assisting teachers inclassrooms, and some parents sat in with their children to comfortand reassure them.One mother, who asked not to be identified, told reporters thather youngest son, a 7-year-old second grader who was on playgroundwhen the shootings occurred, would only come back to school if shestayed with him.They're making it back, slowly but surely, she said, addingthat she planned to spend Friday as she did Thursday, at her son'sside in the classroom.Cleveland School is in the heart of California's third-largestcommunity of refugees from Southeast Asia, and nearly two-thirds ofthe school's population is from Asia. All of the dead children werefrom refugee families, as were 19 of the 29 wounded.School authorities said they were particularly concerned that thekilling might not only revive the psychological trauma of thehorrors they experienced in Southeast Asia, but that those familiesmight flee from the area without accepting counseling if they feareda racial motive in the attack.We want to pass the word to the community that this is not aracist act ... It could happen to anybody, anywhere, anytime. Thisis a crazy action from one individual. It is not racism, said AnTran of the Southeast Asian Refugee Resettlement Program.Stockton Police Capt. Dennis Perry also repeated that there wasno evidence that Purdy, who committed suicide after the attack, wasspecifically targeting Asians.It wasn't any one race or group of people. He hatedeverybody, Perry said of Purdy, who as a child 14 years earlierhad attended Cleveland School.A man fired several dozen shots from anautomatic rifle in an elementary school Tuesday, killing sixchildren, wounding at least 35 other people and then shootinghimself in the head, authorities said.We have at least one suspect in custody who has a gunshot woundto the head, Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble said.Bruce Fernandez, spokesman for the county office of emergencyservices, said six people had died.Ellen Rich at St. Joseph's Medical Center said eight victims werebeing treated there, and said the total, including those beingtreated at other hospitals, was 35 wounded.We have at least 30 people that we've sent out to areahospitals, said Police Chief Jack Calkins.The attack at Cleveland Elementary School came shortly beforenoon. Other children were kept in their rooms, said John Klose,Stockton Unified School District information officer.Police Sgt. James Monk said his office learned that a man wentberserk with an automatic weapon and we have several (people) down.Several dozen shots were heard from an automatic rifle, saidMonk.Children whose families escaped thehorrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into akilling field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle anda pistol bearing the word victory.After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asianchildren were outlined in blue on the playground of ClevelandElementary School where they died. Two others had been dragged byteachers inside to a classroom, but also died. Twenty-nine otherpupils were wounded, along with a teacher.There was shooting all over. ... I was scared, saidsixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in thefinal days of war and had never before heard gunfire. Everybodywas crying in my class.Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26,armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered theschool grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 roundsbefore he shot himself to death.Afterward, a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on theground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body. The wordvictory was written on the pistol handle.Binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting beganoutside the wood-and-stucco school building. Her teacher toldstudents to get under their desks.The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas, whose first thought was thatthe University of the Pacific fraternities near his house werefiring their miniature cannon again.But the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon, and the screamof sirens that followed told him this time was no prank.I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen inStockton, said Cuevas, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port ofStockton who lives down the street from the elementary school.It's always in some other town, some other place. It's a shockto my senses. I don't think it's even hit me as hard as it's goingto. You don't know whether to be excited, or confused or what.Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, whichtypically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off theirchildren.Why here? said Jeff Russell, 37, who was born and reared inthe neighborhood. This has always been a sleepy little town. (Theshooting) put us back on the map.Lutheran and Baptist churches border the school in a neighborhoodof ranch-style homes, postage-stamp lawns and streets lined withsycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of 150,000 people60 miles southeast of San Francisco.The 40-year-old neighborhood near the University of the Pacificis still home to many retired couples who raised their familesthere. But the city has been changing with the influx of SoutheastAsian refugees.When school officials called clergy to console grieving families,Buddhist priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along withtheir white-collared Christian counterparts.About 60 percent of Cleveland Elementary's students are ofSoutheast Asian descent, said John Klose, spokesman for the StocktonSchool District. The five children who were killed were Vietnameseand Cambodian.This is one of our best neighborhood schools, Klose said.Of all of our schools that I would think of something like thishappening, this would be the last one I would think of.Across the street, Sarah Abbott stood astride her bicycle andgazed at the school where she graduated many years ago. Theprofessional nanny said she was at the house of her 97-year-oldgrandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set hiscar on fire before starting to shoot.When the car exploded, my grandpa's house just shook, Abbottsaid. It scared me. ...

26,d091c,"Torrential thunderstorms sent a flashflood surging through a valley into this Ohio River town, killingat least 11 people, leaving 51 missing and scores of othershomeless Friday, authorities said.Raging floodwaters late Thursday swept homes off foundations andwashed away cars. About 200 people were reported evacuated incentral Ohio.The valleys are choked with debris, Gov. Richard Celestetold reporters after flying over the hilly Appalachian region ineastern Ohio. A wall of water wiped a path through the area.The governor declared a state of emergency, and dispatched about50 National Guardsmen to the area.The Federal Emergency Management Agency declared Belmont County,which includes Shadyside, and Jefferson and Franklin countiesdisaster areas, making federal aid available to residents.Seventeen counties now have been declared disaster areas because offlooding or tornadoes since May 29.Ten bodies were taken to the Bauknecht Funeral Home inShadyside, said Bob Bell, funeral director. One body was taken toBellaire City Hospital, he said.Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator, also saidthere were 11 confirmed dead.Earlier, Fire Chief Mark Badia had said 14 adults and twochildren were dead. The names of the victims have not been released.County Sheriff Tom McCort, who said he was running the recoveryeffort, said 51 people in Shadysville and Meade Township, where thetwo creeks run south of the village, were missing as of 8:45 p.m.The list was compiled through telephone inquiries withtownspeople and relatives and interviews with people evacuated fromthe area.About 200 people came and went from a Shadyside disaster centerduring the day, seeking news of missing friends and relatives.Vogt said two bodies were found in the Ohio River and one wasfound in a field next to the river after water receded. He said therest were found in the creeks, which flow into the river.Some of the bodies were taken to a funeral home that set up atemporary morgue in Shadyside, about 10 miles south of Wheeling,W.Va.Officials from Ohio, West Virginia and the U.S. Coast Guard weresearching the Ohio River for survivors and bodies, and Badia saidNational Guardsmen were to continue searching the creeks throughoutthe night.At least five houses along Wegee Creek were washed away, and twocars were floating in water in one of the basements. Anything thatwas still standing was covered with at least 6 feet of debris suchas trees, appliances and furniture.The National Weather Service issued no flood warning before thedisaster, although it did issue a flood watch, said Al Wheeler,deputy meteorologist in the bureau's Cleveland office.Weather service offices in Cleveland, Akron, Columbus andPittsburgh showed the storm had diminished over eastern Ohio whenit had actually intensified, Wheeler said.Thursday night's thunderstorms caused flash flooding across awide area of central and eastern Ohio, northern West Virginia andwestern Pennsylvania. The floods closed roads, damaged homes andforced hundreds of people to evacuate.But no place was hit with anything approaching the ferocity ofthe flooding in Shadyside.About 5.5 inches of rain fell between 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m.,turning two Ohio River tributaries outside the village of 4,300people into dangerous torrents.About 35 buildings, including a tavern, were damaged along WegeeCreek, and 50 buildings were hit by a flood along Pipe Creek, fourmiles south of Wegee Creek, said Dick Quinlin, Belmont Countyemergency services coordinator.Part of the tavern was washed away when water caved in the backwall, said Judy Phillips, a sheriff's department spokeswoman. Shesaid two patrons were accounted for, but she could offer noestimate of how many were inside at the time.One man was found clinging to a bar stool, said state Sen.Robert Ney, whose district includes Shadyside.I've never seen anything of this magnitude. There was nowarning, Ney said.Rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, whichflows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River, said Badia.I don't know how to describe it. ... You've got to see it tobelieve it, Badia said.One resident, Robert Ramsey, said his wife, Rose, was crushed todeath in their house by the water.There was no complete accounting of deaths, said Karen Bovek, aspokeswoman at a Shadyside Fire Department command center set up ana school.You're talking miles and miles of country roads that haven'tbeen gotten to yet, she said. It's a disaster here.There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont,in Licking County in central Ohio, and in northwestern WestVirginia and western Pennsylvania.It's a pretty good mess, especially in the northern end of thecounty, said Clarence Weston, a dispatcher with the MarshallCounty Sheriff's Department in Moundsville, W.Va. We had 3.5inches of rain in a two-hour period last night.Most of the problems in West Virginia were confined to roadclosures and basement flooding.At least 25 people were evacuated during the night in thePittsburgh suburb of Etna, where some homes had up to 5 feet ofwater in their basements, said borough manager Bill Skertich. Theyreturned to their homes Friday.Landslides were reported in the Pittsburgh area, and many citystreets were closed during the storm.The flooding was more serious in Licking County, Ohio. WayneTresemer, the county's Disaster Services director, said water wasstanding up to 5 feet deep in some streets in the town of Newark,and the fire department and other agencies used boats to evacuatesome residents.Two inches of rain caused flooding in Franklin County in centralOhio and 3.75 inches of rain was dumped on Holmes County innorth-central Ohio, the National Weather Service said.In Jefferson County, just north of Belmont County in the easternpart of the state, 50 to 60 residents were evacuated in Adena,where water was 6 to 8 feet deep in streets because of creekflooding.Flood waters in most areas had subsided by Thursday night,according to authorities.The mother of a 12-year-old girl sweptaway by a flash flood was clinging to hope that her daughter wasalive but perhaps unable to get home, a family friend said Saturday.Janice Trigg's daughter, Kerri, was among nearly three dozenstill missing Saturday night, two days after the floods hit easternOhio.She keeps saying Kerri Jo may have amnesia, or she can't moveto get help. That's a mother's hope, said the friend, BettyKreiter, 67.Searchers for the missing used trained dogs to sniff through therubble and along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks, whichempty into the Ohio River, in an effort that stretched five milessouth of this town.Workers also sifted through debris that collected at theHannibal locks and dam on the Ohio River, about 25 miles south.Relatives of the missing were staying with friends and family,said the Rev. Robert Gracey, who was counseling flood victims at aschool turned into a relief center.Kerri had been playing at a friend's house when the one-storyhome suddenly was washed away in the flood Thursday night.The friend, 9-year-old Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creekand into the Ohio River, but survived a seven-mile ordeal byclinging to logs.Amber was released from a hospital Saturday aftertreatment for minor injuries.She said she last saw Kerri when the two, alone in the house,jumped into a bathtub for safety in the storm. The tub was washedinto the creek.Throughout the town, there were stories of fear, luck and closecalls. Deanna Hulderman, 48, said she and her husband, Clancey,were pulled under by Wegee Creek flood water at a bar but werereunited about a half-hour later.Mrs. Hulderman said she, her husband and about seven others werein the 3Ks bar when a wall collapsed and water rushed through.I saw my husband go under and get washed away. He was yellinghow much he loved me, and then I went under, Mrs. Hulderman said.I began praying `God, don't let me die like this,' and the nextthing I knew I was standing on my feet, and the water went down.Mrs. Hulderman said firefighters rescued her husband at themouth of the creek near the Ohio River.Capt. James Boling of the Ohio National Guard said localauthorities told him some of the bar patrons remained unaccountedfor.Kathy Schramm, 37, said she, her husband and their two childrenfled their two-story house before water washed through. When theyreturned, the basement and first floor were flooded, and thesurrounding area looked like a big lake.I looked up at a house on the hill, and it looked like it wason stilts on the water, Mrs. Schramm said.Cement blocks were all that remained ofhomes, fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddystreams meandered through the outskirts of this Ohio River townafter a furious flash flood.Residents donned shorts and hip-waders Friday to begin puttingtheir lives back together after 5{ inches of rain fell in 3{ hourslate Thursday, churning floodwaters that left at least 11 peopledead and 51 others missing early today.The shock had not worn off, said police officer Bruce Fink,whose bristly face bore signs of more than 20 hours on duty,including work at a temporary morgue set up at a funeral home.We have counselors back there now, but we've lost wholefamilies. It's just been devastating, he said Friday night.Fink said he feared there wouldn't be enough funeral homes tohandle the dead in this eastern Ohio town of 4,300 people.Allan Hans called the flooding the devil's work.I lost everything but my car and the clothes I'm wearing, hesaid.Hans said he was sitting in his trailer when he heard a branchcrack and went to check out the noise. He saw rushing water, ran totell neighbors and moved his car. The trailer was swept away by thetime he returned home.John and Sue Wright, whose home rests on the banks of PipeCreek, estimated they lost about $20,000 worth of property.I was one of the lucky ones. What I lost, I can replace,Wright said.Although it was the center of rescue operations, downtownShadyside suffered no apparent flood damage. But it was a differentstory on the outskirts of town, in the heart of Ohio's richest coalfields.Cars were mired roof-deep in mud, and guardrails and chunks ofconcrete were torn from roads.A 20-foot, 18-inch thick beam that held a sign leading to 3K'sBar near Pipe Creek was twisted like a pretzel by the force of whatwitnesses described as a wall of water.People moved rubble and made makeshift repairs to bridges thatspan McMann Creek, which links homes to Ohio Route 147. Manybridges were washed away.Small tractors and four-wheel-drive vehicles were the only meansof transportation in much of the stricken area.At least 170 members of the Ohio National Guard were called into patrol and to help rebuild flood-swept roads, said Stacie Gilg,a spokeswoman for the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.Disasters always bring out the curious, and this was noexception. By Friday night, traffic jammed Ohio Route 7, whichskirts the Ohio River and is the main north-south road through town.Belmont County Sheriff Tom McCort said he suspected many of thevehicles belonged to sightseers.McCort said there were no serious attempts at looting. He saidhe was pleased with the assistance of young people.One young man turned in a strongbox filled with valuable coinslost in the flood, the sheriff said.The kid ... handed me this box and it was unlocked, McCortsaid. It really made me feel good.Thunderstorms swept through central andeastern Ohio, causing flooding that killed at least ten people,left dozens missing and forced hundreds of others from their homes,officials said today.Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4,300 peopleoverflowed when about 4 inches of rain fell Thursday night in aboutan hour.It created a wall of water, said Jim Williams of the OhioEmergency Management Agency. The problem we're having right nowis accounting for the people we can't find.Williams said 40 to 60 people remained unaccounted for at midday.Belmont County's sheriff's Sgt. Bart Giesey said 10 people wereconfirmed dead.Gov. Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency and surveyedthe area.The raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washedaway a bar filled with people in Shadyside, an Appalachian Mountainfoothill town.Temporary morgues were set up at Bellaire City Hospital and afuneral home in Shadyside. Four bodies were brought to the hospitalfrom the Shadyside area, hospital spokesman Lawrence England said.England said the four bodies were taken to the Bauknecht FuneralHome in Shadyside. Patty Valloric, director of the funeral home,said seven bodies had been brought there.The Shadyside Fire Department set up a command center at theJefferson Elementary School to coordinate rescue efforts.Command center spokeswoman Karen Bovek said officials had nocomplete death toll figure. Authorities were searching for victimsin rural areas.You're talking miles and miles of country roads that haven'tbeen gotten to yet, she said. It's a disaster here.Shadyside  about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va.  is inBelmont County, a mostly hilly, rural area in eastern Ohio.Acting Mayor James Amato said the storms created a deluge thatknocked homes off their foundations.There are a lot of trailers out in this area that got hit,he said.Belmont County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Judy Phillipssaid a Shadyside bar full of people was washed away when watercaved in the back wall. Two people were accounted for, she said.But she could offer no estimate of how many were in the bar.Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people fromthree cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and intothe Ohio River.I don't know how to describe it ... you've got to see it tobelieve it, Badia said.There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont,and Licking County in central Ohio.The Ohio departments of transportation and natural resources,the State Highway Patrol, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohioand the American Red Cross are assisting state government inassessing the damage, Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokeswomanStacie Gilg said.About 200 residents were evacuated from their homes in centralOhio after 3 inches of rain fell in an hour, flooding streets andwashing out rural roads.Residents from Newark and Marne in Licking County spent Thursdaynight in three emergency shelters, said Licking County DisasterServices Agency spokesman Neil Snelling. Sixty residents were fromone street in Newark.Nobody has been hurt, but everything is pretty wet here,Snelling said.The Newark Fire Department and other agencies evacuatedresidents in low-lying areas of Newark and the neighboring villageof Marne, said Wayne Tresemer, Licking County Disaster Servicesdirector.He said water was standing up to 5 feet deep in some streets onthe city's east side, and the Newark Fire Department and otheragencies used boats to evacuated some residents.Licking County was already among 14 Ohio counties covered in adisaster declaration issued by President Bush for storms earlierthis month, and people who suffered losses from Thursday night'sstorms will also be eligible for assistance, Ms. Gilg said.In Jefferson County, 50 to 60 residents were evacuated in Adena,where water was 6 to 8 feet deep in streets because of creekflooding.Two inches of rain caused flooding in Franklin County in centralOhio and 3.75 inches of rain was dumped on Holmes County innorth-central Ohio, the National Weather Service said.Flood waters in most areas had subsided by Thursday night, theweather service and local authorities said. The forecast for todaycalled for a slight chance of thunderstorms in central and southernOhio.The death toll from flash floods thatswept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday assearchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.Sixteen people remained missing.Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, andsifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where searchdogs indicated they'd detected human scents, said National GuardCapt. Jim Boling.Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio.Four bodies were found Sunday. But two of those were notimmediately identified, and the list of missing was not revised toaccount for them.The number missing dropped to 16 with the other two bodies andthe removal of two other names: a woman who called to say she wassafe and a person who authorities weren't sure lived in the area,said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.The 20th victim was pulled from the mouth of Pipe Creek at theOhio River, about seven miles south of Shadyside, Vogt said.Another body was found in debris along Wegee Creek, and two bodieswere found earlier in the Ohio, he said.That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's floods to20, including five children.Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching forvictims, said Boling. The digging will continue at least throughTuesday, said Fire Chief Mark Badia.The thing you find once you start into these brush piles andpiles of trees are cars, and they have to be torn apart andsearched separately, Badia said. Everything you turn up createsa different situation.But Vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be foundalive.It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody aliveout there, he said. You can't swim out there that long in theOhio River.The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night duringstorms that poured 5{ inches of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3{ hours.The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40others.Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some ofthose were later found dead, while others notified authorities thatthey were safe.Officials also learned that some of those feared missing hadmoved out of the area. Officials were comparing county propertylists and data from the Census Bureau with information fromresidents and relatives, Boling said.Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusuallyheavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities ofthreebridges over the creeks. Badia said rainwater running downhillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at eachbridge. The dams broke under the water pressure.Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more. The debrisbroke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water, hesaid.As rescue efforts continued, the National Guard cleared roadsand bridges leading into the stricken area.Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areassince tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.Across the border in West Virginia, Gov. Gaston Caperton saidSunday he had no precise dollar figure on damage from floodingFriday along a five-mile stretch near New Martinsville and innearby Ohio County, but estimated it will run into millions ofdollars.No deaths or serious injuries were reported.Caperton toured flooded areas in Wheeling and the Doolin Runcommunity near New Martinsville. He said he saw tremendousdevastation to hundreds of houses, house trailers and cars.State Public Safety Secretary Joseph Skaff estimated thatrepairing and replaceing bridges and roads will cost about $750,000.National Guard soldiers helped with cleanup Sunday.The death toll from last week's flashfloods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River,and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people stilllisted as missing.It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody aliveout there. You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River,said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.The search for the missing was suspended briefly this morningwhen a thunderstorm rolled through the area. Heavy rain fell forabout 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creeks thatoverflowed in Thursday night's flash flood.By midmorning, the muddy creek was nearly crossing a road aboutthree miles upstream from where the floods inflicted the mostdamage. Lt. Dean Irvin of the Ohio Army National Guard said therewere no immediate reports of additional property damage.The body found this morning was in the Ohio River nearMoundsville, W.Va., about 10 miles south of Shadyside, according toChuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.The number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14with the identities of three victims and a call by one personalerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said. One of therecovered bodies remains unidentified. Authorities are not rulingout the possibility that other people not on the list could bemissing.Four bodies were recovered Sunday.Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of thoselater were found dead, while others notified authorities that theywere safe and officials learned that still more had moved out ofthe area.Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{inches of rain in 3{ hours. The floods destroyed as many as 70houses and damaged up to 40 others.Most of those whose homes and belongings were swept away by thewall of water will have to put their lives back together largelywithout benefit of insurance.Few people in the coal-mining and steel-making area carriedflood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damagefrom Thursday's flood, residents and insurers said.We didn't think we needed to have flood insurance. For what?That creek never flooded. Then this. Everybody just got wipedout, said Julia Kulazenka.Rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into thecreeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them, Shadyside FireChief Mark Badia said.Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more. The debrisbroke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,Badia said.The home Mrs. Kulazenka shared with her husband until his deathlast July was damaged as Wegee Creek raged out of control. She saidreplacing a machine shop, garage, deck and automobiles she and herson owned would cost more than $80,000.They told us homeowners' won't do us no good. So unless thegovernment helps us rebuild, I don't know what I'll do with thisplace, Mrs. Kulazenka said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open anoffice Tuesday in Shadyside to accept applications from residentsfor low-interest loans and grants to help them rebuild.Before the flood, land in the Wegee Creek valley fetchedhandsome prices, said Kulazenka's son, Charles Kulazenka. That wasespecially welcome to residents, many of whom were either retiredor laid off from jobs in coal mines in Belmont County, whereunemployment in April was 6.8 percent.Ground was at a premium down here before this because it wasjust outside the city limits (of Shadyside). It was quiet andpeaceful and people were looking to buy and build new homes outhere. Now, you couldn't give it away, Kulazenka said.But we can't be bitter, though, because we've got our lives,and a lot of our neighbors, real close buddies, weren't thatlucky.","LA061890-0066,AP900615-0164,LA061590-0176,AP900616-0123,AP900616-0032,AP900615-0115,AP900618-0018,AP900618-0069",Ohio Flash Flood Kills 21; 14 Still Missing; Dozens Homeless,"Thursday night's flood in Ohio left twenty-one dead, 14 missing and dozens homeless.

27,d098e,"Already they're saying it's thebiggest happening in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to atelescope.So, step right up folks, and discover the wonders of theuniverse. See how big it is. Learn its age. Look at light created14 billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant.Ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the BigBang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago. See stars born and seethem die. Watch galaxies form. Follow the flow of gas into theMilky Way's halo. Peer deep into the universe, past so many starsin our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetimeto count, to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about 200billion stars.For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomespossible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried theHubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seenbefore. The telescope, a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck,has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light.Light, speeding along at 186,000 miles a second, is themessenger of creation. Tracking the trail of light from today tothe first moments contains all the information we will ever haveabout the creation of the universe.The Hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps tothe first echoes of creation. This is a world-class event, even ifastronomy is not your thing.Superlatives?In the history of optical astronomy there have been two greatleaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in theautumn of 1609, and the Hubble Space Telescope in April 1990. Eric J. Chaisson, a senior scientist at the Space Telescope ScienceInstitute in Baltimore.One more?No one ever made anything that good, James Westphal,California Institute of Technology.Another?Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that theHubble telescope will literally be the dawn of a new era inastronomy.Eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance. But the HST, namedafter Edwin Powell Hubble, holds that kind of promise.Hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century whoconcluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from Earthbut that the farther away they are, the faster they move. Thetheory of an expanding universe supported the belief that theuniverse originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter isstill rushing from the site of that so-called Big Bang.Astronomers think the Big Bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billionyears ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incrediblespeed and heat. Eventually matter cooled and condensed intogalaxies, stars and planets.There are bigger telescopes than the Hubble, but they are all onEarth and all subject to a major limitation  the atmosphere which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through. Theproblem of skywatching through layers of air has been likened tobirdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool.The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing views ofEarth's sister planets, had to travel 12 years to get close enoughfor pictures as they whizzed past. With the Hubble, says scientistEdward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want.The telescope is 42.5 by 14 feet and consists of a 94.5-inchprimary mirror that gathers incoming light.On a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two milesaway, says Weiler, chief NASA scientist on the Hubble project.With a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000miles away. With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia fromWashington.Ground controllers at the GoddardSpace Flight Center finally made contact today with the two mainantennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after tryingfor more than six hours to lock on.Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md.,as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space wassolved.We have confirmation that we have achieved communication withthe Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antennasystem, said NASA's Dave Drachlis.Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas wereworking all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointingeither the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communicationssatellite that acts as a switchboard.In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of theantennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2degrees to 10.8 degrees.The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmitinformation at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies,were working well.Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedycertain problems. The outage was not a problem for which spacewalkers would have been summoned.The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures ofstorms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doingexperiments.Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects ofthe telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error andwas not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT andlasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllersattempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gainantennas through the TDRS.This time it was a pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, aGoddard spokesman. It's a new spacecraft and we thinkinexperience dealing with it was the cause.The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, wasreleased from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minutesnag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loudrendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite.Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after thatsong, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are alot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday andHubble had a good night while you were asleep.We appreciate the good words from everybody, repliedDiscovery Commander Loren Shriver.After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discoveryaway from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series ofmaneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to parkDiscovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, andwe sure hope it does good work, Shriver said Wednesday.Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great workyou've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud ofyou.Scientists have hailed the Hubble  NASA's most expensiveunmanned spacecraft  as the greatest advance in astronomy sinceGalileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescopewhile controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble isoperating properly, such as responding to directional commands.The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-footaperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished94.5-inch mirror to starlight.Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image fromthe telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.Data will follow in a month or two.If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery couldreturn to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalkto fix it.Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would betested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture dooris opened.We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger theHubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, hesaid. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitiveinstruments.On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoistit from the cargo bay.One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast asexpected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries,which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budgewhen the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way outon the third attempt.By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and KathrynSullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes awayfrom taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenancecall.Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit wasdictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distortingatmosphere.Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost thebeginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant theirlight has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope todetermine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimatedat 15 billion years ago.The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 butwas delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled toland Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.Five astronauts boarded Discoverytoday for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope intoorbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues tothe beginning of time.Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation ofwhat the Hubble will be able to accomplish, said Lennard Fisk,head of NASA science activities.Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance theweather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at thescheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquidoxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed intothe crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy SpaceCenter.The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will giveastronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have, saidWilliam Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't saywhat we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learnmany new things.Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest ashuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its properorbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35thshuttle mission.Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astroobservatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only thesecond time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986just before the Challenger explosion.Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983,delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. Thelatest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch wasscrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power uniton the shuttle.The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably lessfestive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds ofastronomers gathered with their families.The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley willuse the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescopeinto space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and KathrynSullivan will assist if a problem develops.Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two daysuntil after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished94.5-inch mirror to starlight.Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data bysatellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said itwill release its first image  an open star cluster in theconstellation Carina  a week after launch.In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million hasbeen spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer softwareto operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed$250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate andmaintain the telescope in space.During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provideastronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times moresensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they willbe able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has beentraveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mysterysurrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also isexpected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. Hiswork gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was createdby a tremendous explosion.In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filledwith sensors to measure the space radiation that astronautsreceive. It is the skull's third trip into space.The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing atEdwards Air Force Base, Calif.Seven years late, the Hubble SpaceTelescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search ofothers so distant that they may have been formed at the beginningof time.Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttleDiscovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its firsttest radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheers eruptedin Mission Control in Houston.As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect, saidastronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesdaywill be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant bluesky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 milesabove Earth  higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle. Therethe Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creationwith instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.Our window on the universe! NASA launch commentator GeorgeDiller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbitinstead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years, saidNASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's in its element and I'mdelighted.The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technicalproblems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment. Itsuffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown wasstopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faultyhydraulic unit on the shuttle.While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million amonth to exercise and keep in readiness. In its first day in space,that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of theGoddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent ofscientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance inastronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly400 years ago.Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was askedabout the long delays in getting the telescope to its workingstation.Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day thatGalileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?' saidTruly, a former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day welaunch Hubble, it matters that we do it right.The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about thesize of a railroad tank car. When it flies free, it will receiveelectrical power for its six scientific instruments from twowing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side.It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whotheorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther awaya galaxy is, the faster it is traveling. That gave support to thetheory that a massive explosion  the Big Bang  created theuniverse 10 to 20 billion years ago.The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two majorquestions: How old is the universe? How big is it?The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, theother 12 inches. Two of the instruments are cameras, two arespectrometers and one is a photometer. In addition, the finepointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precisemeasurement of distances.On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope withthe shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, pointit, and  after a long checkout  drop it overboard to orbit on itsown.In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power fromthe shuttle. But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted outand it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels areextended to receive light from the sun.Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists BruceMcCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partiallydressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay tounfurl the arrays manually.Discovery's launch was not without its problems.With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runsthe final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve andstopped the launch process. The problem was overcome and theshuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT atEdwards Air Force Base in California.On the way uphill, as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, theshuttle's windshield was splattered with several flecks ofthings. He said the windshield was streaked by the debris andthat it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell offduring the climb to orbit.The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit,and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative. Neitherproblem was considered serious.Discovery's astronauts overcamebalky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating freefrom the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of theuniverse.The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3minutes at an altitude of 380 miles  high above the atmosphere,which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.Discovery, go for Hubble release, Mission Control told thecrew at 3:37 p.m. EDT. The event occurred a minute later as theshuttle slowly and carefully backed away.The final hours before its release were a nightmare for groundcontrollers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panelsthat power the telescope's instruments.The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from itsreel. Mission Control ordered space-walking astronauts to be readyto go out of the cabin to help. But there was a third try and itwas successful.We have confirmation that the solar array wing on thestarboard side has been deployed, the telescope control center inMaryland said.So we have good news, said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubblecontrol center.The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power toflow into the telescope's batteries, relieving worries that theywould use up their eight-hour charge.Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12{-tontelescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, itsinstruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power andshifted over to the batteries.Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B atKennedy Space Center, the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly onits own, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The game hasbegun. The race is on. The clock is ticking.Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put onspacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walkoutside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of thesolar panels failed.Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at theend of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from its silver surfaceand a turning Earth in the background.Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shrivermaneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position, with its nosepointed toward the sun. That was to put the telescope's solararrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly startcollecting energy and protect the telescope's fixed star trackerswhile the instrument was being held above the payload bay.Discovery is in orbit 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higherthan any previous shuttle. The orbit was dictated by the need toput the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.For those technically inclined this morning, I'd like to passon the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer (Hawley),something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far awaytoday, Shriver said.The five astronauts' busy day began on a musical note early thismorning as Mission Control played a song called Space is OurWorld, written by members of Discovery's training team and aHouston-area group, Private Numbers.Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space FlightCenter in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detectedso far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmannedspacecraft ever built.Everything has just being going like clockwork, said RonSchlagheck, shift director of orbital verifications at Goddard.Everybody is in excellent spirits.The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place inspace. It finally got a ride into orbit Tuesday morning aboardDiscovery.Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies sodistant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth. Itis expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe,and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holesand even find stars with planets that could conceivably supportlife.The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet indiameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it is inorbit, it will receive electrical power for its six scientificinstruments from two winglike solar arrays.It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whosediscovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave riseto the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by atremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.The Hubble Space Telescope wasawakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still withoutthe use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instrumentswere on hold, unable to begin any observations.We are out of the `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, asupervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope. He said thetelescope was running on a normal control-all mode, where itsown computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for areturn to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earthand talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about thewidespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expectedeventually to look back 14 billion light years  nearly to thebirth of the universe.It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heardof the Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It makes littlekids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to learn how to addand subtract and study science.The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had beenin a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlierproblems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relaysatellite. The antennas are the primary links for relayingscientific data to the ground.Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recordersin the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems andthat these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennasare working properly.We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, hesaid. Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via itssecondary antennas but the communications system is not useful forscientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, ineffect a standby mode, he said.Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commandsthat took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to runa 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope isoperating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startupprocess, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and carefulapproach to these problems, Olivier said Friday. This is notthe time to do anything dumb.The telescope problems have put the flight center several daysbehind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this weekwere sticking to their schedule.Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a closewatch on the weather.Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph attouchdown.The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three daysbeyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDTtoday by playing the song, Cosmos.Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate fortoday, said Commander Loren Shriver.The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope,which is now open for business, said Mission Control commentatorJames Hartsfield.The astronauts were to finish up their experiments andphotography today and pack for the trip home. They also planned tohold a news conference from space with reporters at the JohnsonSpace Center.Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series oftests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets wereready for return to Earth.The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed closeto the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperturedoor. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivanwere prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open inorbit 380 miles above Earth.But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Fridaymorning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye tostarlight for the first time.Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stoppedworking when the door opened, but engineers later got them back online. The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too,kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, directorof orbital verifications at Goddard.A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set atconservative limits for the first operations and that caused manymalfunctions. There also were two communications outages totalingseveral hours.Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master ofits own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communicationssystem is lost for extended periods, Terry said.NASA had planned to release its first test image from thetelescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in theconstellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed becauseof the antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month ortwo.The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to lookback 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of theuniverse.The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billionyears ago in a cosmic explosion.Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding andthat the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is movingaway.The Hubble Space Telescope orbitedwith its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcamecommunications problems and lifted its lens cover, but itselectronics were shut down due to a malfunction.Those problems, however, were not the immediate concern ofshuttle Discovery's astronauts, who prepared for Sunday's return toEarth.You've been released from Hubble support. It's on its own,Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members.That's great news, replied Discovery commander Loren J.Shriver.There are handshakes and smiles all around up here. I'll betit's just that way back down there, too, added mission specialistSteven Hawley. Who's buying tonight?We'll buy when you all get back, Musgrave replied.Flight director William Reeves said it was too early to cheer.`We still have an important part of the mission to go, Reevessaid. We reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on theground.Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif. Landing would have been delayed a day ifastronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to performa space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperturedoor.The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperturedoor opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath thetelescope later in the day.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned torelease its first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope onTuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.But Steve Terry, director of orbital verifications, said that wouldbe delayed by problems with Hubble's high-speed antennas.Scientific data will follow in a month or two.Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened to theheavens at 10:30 a.m. EDT, nearly four hours later than planned,exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for thefirst time.Ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lifteven though the telescope was in an automatic safe mode, withall motion stopped because of problems in linking its high-speeddish antennas with a relay satellite.One of the two antennas apparently had swung too far, and thetelescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, a Hubble deputy projectmanager. If future movements of the antenna have to be limited toavoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on thetelescope's observing time, Oliver said.Terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have beendelayed much longer.There has to be a point where you say they have to go theirway and we have to go ours, he said of the astronauts.When the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizinggyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them back on line.The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros, said DaveDrachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. That, too,kept it in the safe mode.Oliver said it would be Saturday morning before the telescope isbrought out of the safe mode. It will take another day to get theinstrument operating normally again, putting controllers at Goddardseveral days behind.We're trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut anycorners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at riskhere and we want to make sure we're doing it properly, Oliversaid. We've got a long future ahead of us, and we want to makesure it starts off on the right foot.NASA said the telescope was safe and in a stable position.Tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularlynarrow for the first operations and that was the cause of manymalfunctions, Terry said. In addition to that trouble, there weretwo communications outages totaling several hours.We're cautious, and that's natural, Terry said. We've gota very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anythingto jeopardize the usefulness. ... We'll get to the point where weknow exactly what the spacecraft will do and set t","AP900425-0013,AP900426-0135,AP900424-0048,AP900424-0096,AP900425-0146,AP900428-0050,AP900427-0146,AP900426-0185,AP900421-0075,AP900425-0198,AP900424-0081,AP900427-0083",How the Hubble Space Telescope Finally Got Into Orbit,"After a delay of seven years caused by technical problems and the Challenger accident, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched on space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990 and four days later was orbiting on its own 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere. The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,
28,d099e,"And for the sentimentalists, there will be 83-year-old Johnny Kelleystarting in his 60th Boston Marathon. There have only been 35 editions of thisrace run without him.; The last three Boston marathons have turned intoreckless speed duels. They have produced five of the top 10 times and eight ofthe top 15 in the race's storied history.; They also have resulted in arace of attrition, with many of the early speedsters burning out completely orfaltering in the late stages.; Along the historic route that begins inHopkinton, west of Boston, and ends in Copley Square in the Back Bay sectionof the city, checkpoint records have fallen at an alarming rate.; Forexample, all 11 checkpoint records were shattered through the first 20 mileslast year, either by Simon Robert Naali or Juma Ikangaa, both of Tanzania.Neither won.; The winner was 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, whooutsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient, calculating race.;Running alone about 200 meters behind a pack of six Africans, Bordin passedthem all by 21 miles and went on to win in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, thesecond-fastest time in the race's history, behind only the 2:07:51 by Rob deCastella in 1986.; Ikangaa finished a distant second in 2:09:52. It was histhird consecutive runner-up finish in Boston.; Ikangaa is back again, alongwith several other formidable Africans. They include Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya,the 1988 winner in 2:08:43, the third-fastest time in Boston and one secondahead of Ikangaa; Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia, the 1989 champion in 2:09:06,Boston's eighth-best time; Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya, the 1987 world championand 1988 Olympic silver medalist who is making his Boston debut; and Naali,the third-place finisher in the 1990 Commonwealth Games.; Among thosechasing them will be John Treacy, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist and thethird-place finisher in Boston in 1988 and 1989; Geoff Smith, the Bostonwinner in 1984-85; Ed Eyestone, the top-ranked U.S. marathoner; SalvadorGarcia, the runner-up to Wakiihuri in last year's New York City Marathon; andRolando Vera, who finished third in his marathon debut in Boston in 1990.;The women's division also is filled with many respectable entrants.;Foremost among them are Kristiansen, the 35-year-old Norwegian who holds theworld record of 2:21:06 and won in Boston in 1986 and 1989, and Samuelson, 33,the U.S.-record holder at 2:21:21, 1984 Olympic gold medalist and Bostonchampion in 1979 and 1983.; Challenging them will be Uta Pippig, WandaPanfil and Kim Jones.; Pippig finished second in Boston last year in acareer-best 2:28:03. Panfil won the London Marathon in 2:26:31, her personalbest, and won the New York City Marathon in 1990.TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and oneof the most prestigious events of the Games will be held. It is also withoutdoubt the most gruelling. Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollutionlevels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men'smarathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run. There arelots of figures to show why. It is estimated that when the race begins inMataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be analready-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards the marathon's end, however, radiantheat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to atemperature of up to 30`C. More debilitating still, relative humidity inBarcelona in August rises as high as 80 per cent. With more than 10kilometres still to go, most of the course is an upward run. The last 4.6km,which take the runners 60m higher still to the Olympic stadium at the top ofthe hill of Montjuic, has an average gradient of more than 4.5 per cent, andincludes some sections of 7 per cent, equivalent in skiing terms to a steep'red' run. But we do not need figures to convince us of the extraordinarydifficulty of tomorrow's race. Last Saturday, in the Olympic stadium, Iwatched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon, begun atthe same time of day and run in similar conditions. Never in any eventvoluntarily entered into, sporting or otherwise, have I seen such signs ofphysical and mental distress. The race was won by the Unified Team'sValentina Yegorova in 2 hours 32 minutes, a time considerably slower thanthat achieved by women on less demanding Olympic marathon courses in LosAngeles and Seoul. After her nearest competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, camein eight seconds later, they had the energy - between bouts of grimacing andlowering their heads to their knees - to embrace each other and smile forthe cameras.It was a different story in the 'mixed zone,' the area under the stadiumwhere athletes recover after their events. As runner after runner stumbledand limped into the room - several were brought in senseless on stretchers -the scene seemed to be populated by exhausted boat people rescued afterweeks of exposure and deprivation at sea.As a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face,Manuela Machado of Mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into apotted palm. Several competitors lay prone and gasping on the ground aswater was poured over them; others stood hunched over, grasping theirabdomens.If anyone moved at all, it was with agonised faces and the slowest ofhobbles. These are not the sort of scenes likely to promote enthusiasm formarathon running or for the ideals of Olympic competition.Chris Brasher, organiser of the London marathon, was on hand to witness thesuffering, and was incensed. Male marathon runners will face the same kindof problems with heat, humidity, and an over-demanding terrain, he said.In his opinion, gearing the marathon to prime-time TV viewing and having theevent end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators wasunjustified and a 'sell-out to commercialism.'To put on the marathon in the late afternoon, rather than first thing inthe morning (the normal practice), and then to make them run 4km up a hillis just criminal in my opinion,' said Brasher, a former Olympic gold medalathlete and noted sportswriter.I spoke to Britain's Steve Brace, winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and1990, the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event.He agrees that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regardsOlympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career, he is cautious abouttomorrow's slog.Like almost all the athletes running tomorrow, Brace is a professionalrunner who specialises in marathons. He takes an objective, long-term viewof his profession. As an income-earner, marathon running is an activity withliabilities and limitations, and requires business management as well asphysical ability.The winner of the London marathon earns a tidy Dollars 50,000 and the NewYork, Boston and Japanese runs are all in the same prize-winning category.But these and less financially-rewarding events are physically debilitating,and can only be won if a competitor is in top physical shape.With their careers and financial prospects in mind, top-level runnersnormally only run two marathons a year. As Brace says, when you have onlytwo pay-days out of 365, you choose, plan and train for them with greatcare.Brace trains extremely carefully indeed. 'Running a marathon is the easypart,' he says. 'The hard part is the lead-up to achieving the performancelevel required.' He starts training three months before an event by running80 miles a week and then building progressively. For the last six weeks heruns 120 miles a week.Normally he would hope that such a routine brings a pay-off. But the Olympicmarathon is an exception: the only top-level marathon that carries no prizemoney. Brace says that in spite of the prestige and possible financialspin-offs involved, 'it does not necessarily make sense to run to win.'Given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preservephysical condition for races that do bring in money, he says, many runnerswill give less than their best effort.Nonetheless, there are plenty whose considerations stretch beyond the purelyfinancial. Italian Gelindo Bordin, who came first in the 1988 Seoul Olympicmarathon, is a strong contender. So is Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who camethird in Seoul. Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi of Japan arealso possible winners.None of them, though, will make a molehill out of the steep and formidableascent of Montjuic.A crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here March 1 to run 26 miles, 385 yards. And cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees. Makers of cars, soda pop, sportswear, copiers, computers -- even a hospital -- have tagged their names to the Los Angeles Marathon. In the promoter's words, this run is ""a marketing event on legs,"" reflecting marathoning's growing importance in upscale product promotions. Runners, it seems, are a well-heeled lot. A study by Mercedes-Benz found that 42% of family heads making $40,000 a year or more jog regularly. Of potential buyers showing up at Mercedes dealers, 47% are joggers. With those numbers in mind, the car maker has become a sponsor of three marathons -- in New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- as well as other running races. Marathons have had corporate backing for some time. But Los Angeles is ahead of the pack in making distance running a commercial spectacle. The city that invented the corporate-sponsored Olympics has created a marathon unlike others -- artfully dressed as an Olympic-type amateur race, but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it -- as well as for the city. ""I took air and made an event,"" says William Burke, the founder and president of Los Angeles Marathon Inc. For a man whose running days ended with his high school track team, Mr. Burke is turning a lot of heads in the world of marathoning. Last year, its first time out, the Los Angeles race attracted nearly 11,000 runners -- four times the number forecast and enough to make it the third -- largest race in the U.S. The event also pulled in about $4 million in cash and services from its sponsors, leaving the organizers with $370,000 in red ink. This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect to gross about $5 million in cash and services and to break even. Next year, they say, a profit is possible. More than 18,000 runners are expected this year. An audience of perhaps a million and a half or more will line the route, drawn in part by advertisements on 75 million Coca-Cola cans and 2,500 billboards around the Los Angeles area. Marketing experts say the festive atmosphere of big crowds in the streets makes marathons attractive to sponsors. For the cost of a 30-second ad on the Super Bowl, a company can sponsor a marathon and ""take over a city,"" says Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Reports, a Chicago-based newsletter. The Los Angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps done more than their counterparts elsewhere to publicize the event. Los Angelenos are seeing plugs for the race on millions of grocery bags, milk cartons and loaves of bread, in addition to soda cans, billboards and other sources. The venerable New York Marathon is taking note. The New York Road Runners Club, organizer of the race, stopped promoting the event some years ago because it had all the runners it wanted. Now, Fred Lebow, the group's president, says he is encouraging sponsors to promote the race as the Los Angeles sponsors do. The promotion in Los Angeles is unabashed. ""We tell people that if they're looking for a new way to crack the Los Angeles market, this is it,"" says Mr. Burke. The pitch has attracted the likes of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles; Vons Cos., a large supermarket chain; the Los Angeles Times; the Sears Savings Bank unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc. One supporter is Ellesse USA, a sportswear and shoe producer. A $50,000 fee enables the company to use the marathon's name in its ads; Ellesse will spend an additional $100,000 dressing race personnel in T-shirts and warm-up suits, showing its clothes at the marathon's public ""Expo"" of sponsors' wares, and posting a dozen big street banners along the course. The company has rented more than 500 billboards at a cut-rate price of $120,000 from Patrick Media Group, a marathon sponsor. The discount, about 50%, was important. ""We couldn't have bought that kind of exposure normally,"" says Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director. Ellesse, which also sponsors the New York run, finds the West Coast event more freewheeling. ""They have let us do whatever we want,"" says Ms. Cialone. For instance, product banners along the route -- almost impossible to arrange in New York -- are a snap in Los Angeles. The city, in fact, is a partner in the race. After competitive bidding, it awarded an eight-year contract to Los Angeles Marathon Inc. to put on the race. The exclusive franchise calls for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum $60,000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipts to the city. The organizers also will pay the cost of city services for the marathon, estimated at $100,000. The race sponsors and city officials are trading freely on the good will generated by Los Angeles's role as host of the 1984 Olympics. The logo of the marathon is a shield with laurel wreath. Some posters show the Los Angeles Coliseum with its torch and giant Olympic symbol. ""The World Returns to Los Angeles,"" proclaims one Mercedes-Benz ad. Race directors are called ""commissioners,"" a term borrowed from the 1984 Olympic organization, in which Mr. Burke was commissioner of tennis. And like the Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portraying the race as a civic celebration, thrives on volunteers. Some 7,500 people will work for free to monitor the course on race day. And two-thirds of the race's office staff work without pay. ""I couldn't buy this,"" Mr. Burke says, gesturing around the crowded race headquarters. Not everyone works for free. Big-name runners, for instance, want to be paid a lot. And here, the organizers have pinched pennies. While some runners will be paid to appear, this year's field, like last year's, lacks some of the superstars who race in Boston, New York and London. Grete Waitz, one of the best woman marathoners, wanted $100,000 to appear in Los Angeles; she was turned down. Mr. Burke says the Australian runner Rob de Castella made it known through his agent that he wouldn't run any marathons in the spring but, for $25,000, he'd be happy to say the Los Angeles event was tempting. Mr. Burke says he slammed down the phone. ""We won't spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners,"" he says. Mr. de Castella's agent denies the story entirely. What Los Angeles lacks in superstars, it plans to make up for in numbers. This year's race may challenge New York and London as the largest marathon ever run. Some 20,500 started the New York race last year. Mr. Lebow, organizer of the New York event, says next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number. For one sponsor, this may be a mixed blessing. Orthopaedic Hospital, a not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship is part of a publicity campaign, provides emergency care stations along the marathon route. Last year, one of every 20 runners needed aid. Along with sprains, strains and blisters came more serious cases of exhaustion and hypothermia. A spokeswoman says: ""We advised 250 people to quit the race.""The Olympic trials, scheduled for January, have made Nichols' job mucheasier this year. Most top-ranked U.S. women are looking for any summer-timemarathon in which to run and the San Francisco version offers excellentconditions.; The hills of San Francisco make this marathon challenging. Theweather, however, makes it one of the few enticing races held from June toSeptember. Early morning temperatures range in the low 50s in late June.;""This is the only place in the world where you can have a marathon in themiddle of summer,"" Nichols said.; Defending champ back;  Last year'swinner, Janis Klecker of Minnetonka, Minn., is entered. The field also boastsJanine Aiello of Albuquerque, N.M.; Michelle Bush-Cuke of Berrien Springs,Mich.; Christine Gibbons of Elmwood, N.J.; Lesley Lahane of Chestnut Hills,Mass.; Julie Shea-Graw of Raleigh, N.C., and Jane Welzel of Fort Collins,Colo.; All seven women have run marathons under the 2-hour, 40-minutebarrier. Klecker turned in a 2:39:52 on the 26.2-mile course.; Welzel isthe 1990 national champion, Gibbons has won 26 marathons, Lahane is a formercross-country national champion and Aiello twice has finished second in SanFrancisco.; A test for Shea-Graw; Shea-Graw, 32, finished third in the 1981New York City Marathon and was consistently ranked among the top five Americanrunners throughout most of the early '80s. She was the top qualifier for the1980 Olympics team that missed the Moscow Summer Games because of a U.S.boycott.; This will be Shea-Graw's first race outside of North Carolinasince 1986, when she took time off to have a child.; ""I've run some localraces,"" Shea-Graw said. ""This is going to be a test for me. If it goes well,then I'll up the ante and give my training the time that is needed to becomecompetitive again.""; Shea-Graw's best time is 2:30:11.; ""I had somemajor injuries and wanted to have a child,"" Shea-Graw said. ""But now it's timeto get on with my career.""Mr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his60th Boston Marathon. And even at the age of 83, he probablywill finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runnersexpected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April15.Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plansto run again this year, marvels at Mr. Kelley: ""It'sincomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing.I'm struggling at the age of 43. . . . This isn't golf.""Even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385yards leaves some of Mr. Kelley's rivals of yesteryeargasping. ""Aghast is more like it,"" says Leslie Pawson, 86, athree-time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half acentury ago. ""My doctor says: `No running, whatsoever.' Ican't even remember when I ran my last marathon.""John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time whenmarathoners did it for glory and cab fare. A two-time winnerin Boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, Mr.Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year-- as he has been for 15 years.Mr. Kelley is such an institution that Hopkinton, Mass.,where the race begins, has made him an honorary citizen.(""That means I don't have to pay taxes there,"" he jokes.) Twostate troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr.Kelley into Boston so he won't be trampled by ""groupies,"" ashe calls them, clamoring to shake his hand. Last year, fiveJapanese runners were waved away by the bodyguards, as theysidled up to the old celebrity during the race. Recalls SuniTomomitsu, one of the runners: ""At first we thought, `Oh,wow, he's like Mafia man.' Then we said, `Oh no, this is niceJohnny Kelley.' In Japan, he is awesome.""Though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the BostonMarathon, Mr. Kelley is the oldest to run it. Peter Foley,who was born in 1859, was a regular until he was well intohis 80s. But he walked the course. Starting at dawn (sixhours before the official noon start), Mr. Foley wouldeventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight.Of course, Mr. Kelley -- not to be confused with the otherJohn Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn't therunner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32minutes, 7 seconds. His best time ever was in 1945: 2 hours,30 minutes, 40 seconds. Last year he finished in 5 hours, 5minutes. He hopes to do better in 1991. ""That's not aprediction, just a goal,"" he says.When John Kelley first toed the line in 1928, George Bushwasn't yet in kindergarten, Joe DiMaggio was an unknown andNike was the winged goddess of victory, not a running shoe.In those days, Mr. Kelley recalls, he ran in black leatherhigh-jumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razorblade. ""I would have loved to run with the worst pair ofsneakers on the market today,"" he says.Back then, the sport didn't have much of a following.Today, of course, the Boston Marathon is a big deal, coveredby TV from start to finish and offering $402,000 altogetherin prize money.""The winners get a medal and $55,000,"" says Mr. Kelley. ""Igot a medal and beef stew. God bless them,"" he adds. ""Theydeserve it.""The rosy-cheeked, supple Mr. Kelley is a medical wonder.Each year, he visits the Cooper Clinic at the Aerobics Centerin Dallas for a battery of endurance tests. ""Physiologically,whatever that means, I got all A's,"" Mr. Kelley reports ofhis checkup four months ago.""What that means,"" explains Kenneth Cooper, the physicianwho wrote ""Aerobics"" and several sequels and is now at workon a book on elderly athletes, ""is that Johnny has the bodyof a man 23 years younger. He's going to be one of the starsof my book."" Mr. Kelley's resting pulse rate -- 60 beats aminute -- is well below the average person's 72 beats.(That's good.) On the stress test the clinic gives, Mr.Kelley holds the endurance record for his age group.A mechanic for Boston Edison Co. before he retired in1972, Mr. Kelley started running in the evenings after workmore than six decades ago. His only purpose was to relax andhave some fun. ""All day long, I did what my boss told me todo,"" he recalls. ""But when I ran at night, I felt free. I rantill I was exhausted.""In 1928, when he was 21, he entered his first BostonMarathon but didn't finish. He dropped out three-quarters ofthe way through the race. Then, in 1933, he finished 37th ina field of about 200 runners. In all the years since, he hasmissed the race just once, in 1967. (He has competed, alltold, in 112 marathons, including the 1936 and 1948 Olympics.Mr. Kelley well knows the jagged course from Hopkinton todowntown Boston:The first challenge comes five miles into the race, wherea set of little hills can get a psyched runner to wasteenergy charging up the slopes. A mile and a half later,there's new reason to beware: The smells of Cavanaugh'sBakery can set off hunger pangs.An Exxon station in Wellesley marks the halfway point. Asteep descent into Newton Lower Falls can jar a tiredrunner's bones. Then, at the end of a long column of oak andmaple trees, is Heartbreak Hill, his nemesis. It cost him atleast two victories, he says. And finally there's the HauntedMile, a stretch where many runners have collapsed. Boston'sskyline, 2 1/2 miles in the distance, can seem so far away.Though still going strong, Mr. Kelley acknowledges themarathon gets tougher each year. To compensate, he trainsharder. He used to start preparing in earnest at the end ofJanuary. ""In recent years, I've been in training 12 months ayear,"" he says, though the serious stuff -- a daily one-hourrun, sprints on the track and long, 2 1/2-hour runs everyother week -- begins in December. (He doesn't count the mileshe puts in, as many long-distance runners obsessively do, buthe says he wouldn't object to an estimate of about 50 miles aweek.)Mr. Kelley always trains at 5 a.m., and alone: ""It's aquiet time, no traffic; the air is fresh and sweet."" Hisroutes vary. In January, he prefers the frozen sands of thebeach. With the approach of spring, he takes to the alder andscrub-pine hills and bluffs where the sun can be seen risingover Cape Cod Bay. After his morning run, he spends a coupleof hours painting (still lifes and Cape Cod scenes), a hobbyhe took up about 25 years ago.Unlike many runners, Mr. Kelley doesn't bother withstretching exercises before he runs in the morning. ""This ismy warm up: I empty the dishwasher, I set up the coffeepot,but I don't plug it in. I set up the breakfast table. Then Icheck the outside temperature to see what clothes to wear.""He and his wife, Laura, live in a two-bedroom ranch-stylehouse here in East Dennis, with more than 350 trophies,medals and sweat-stained marathon numbers scattered about. Heisn't particular about brands of shoes (""I wear them all"") orwhat he eats (""I never eat broccoli, but I love steak and icecream."")Mr. Kelley aims to run till he is at least 100 years old.""He's a strange man,"" says Laura Kelley, in awe of herhusband's vigor. The 82-year-old Mrs. Kelley adds, ""I justtry to stay in his shadow, but I have a hard time even doingthat.""In a rare moment of reflection, Mr. Kelley explains whatmakes him tick: ""I paint because I like it. I run because Ilike it. If for some reason I don't finish the marathon, Idon't owe an apology to anyone. But I'll tell you, the BostonMarathon -- with all those people waving -- is better than mybirthday.""Television watchers of the 19th annual New YorkCity Marathon followed the step-by-step progress Sunday of theleaders, but many spectators on the course scanned the thousands ofrunners for a familar face.The winner in the field of 23,478  largest ever for a marathon was Steve Jones of Wales, who finished in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 20seconds, only seven seconds off the course record. Grete Waitz ofNorway won the women's division for a record ninth time in 2:28:07.Marybeth Torpe was hoping another runner would run fast  herboyfriend Tony Giannelli.She and several others had staked out the corner table at arestaurant on First Avenue to get a good view of the runners as theyromped off the Queensboro Bridge.Their hopes on seeing Giannelli depended on how fast the Yonkersnative ran. We have to leave this table by 12:30. The manager'skicking us out, said one of Giannelli's friends, Pete Koogan.Torpe was eager for Giannelli to finish, too.I'm going to ask him to marry me today, she said, holding upthe rose she planned to give him.Crowds cheered for the those in the lead packs and the also-ranson the warm, sunny autumn day.Lynne Avery, a sophomore at Morristown (N.J.) High School, waitedon First Avenue near 60th Street hoping to catch a glimpse of herEnglish teacher, Robert Paciorkowski. But she was not taking anychances on missing him.Mr. Paciorkowski told us if he saw a television camera, he'dwave to us, Avery said  as she held a small portable televisionin her hand.All along the marathon route, volunteers handed drinks torunners, but Rick Fairlamb of Glen Rock, N.J., had prepared aspecial elixir of carrot juice. He handed them out to the 50 or sorunners in the Natural Living running club who passed his tableat 61st Street and First Avenue.Last night I went into Brooklyn and got 500 pounds of carrotsfrom a food co-op. We juiced them starting at 5 this morning, hesaid.In Central Park, Richard Borrego stood on the railing with abullhorn, waiting for his favorites in the race to pass. He didn'thave any trouble finding them.I'm cheering for Grete and Steve Jones, Mr. Borrego said,referring to the winners.They're both so courteous, full of good sportsmanship. Theyalways help other runners. They never knock other runners, Borregosaid. And that's the way it should be.In Washington, D.C., more than 13,000 people from 23 countriesand 49 states ran the Marine Corps Marathon, which offers no prizemoney and prides itself on being the people's race.Jim Hage, a lawyer from Lanham, Md., who had never won a majormarathon, pulled away from two-time champion Brad Ingram in the lasthalf mile to win in 2:21:58.But a unique subset has formed: people who like to do both at the sametime. And to help these folks along, companies arrange tours for marathonvacations. The result? Bangkok in November, London in April and Stockholm inMay.;""Skiers have mountain ranges, tennis players have resorts, why can't arunner take a marathon vacation?"" said Thorn Gilligan, president of MarathonTours in Boston. ""A runner should be able to enjoy a closed city for a day.It's a celebration for the sport as much as a competition."";Gilligan took5,500 people last year on 20 tours to countries from Bermuda to Moscow. Inaddition to air fare and hotel, runners are guaranteed spots in restrictedentry races such as the London Marathon. Qualifying times are not required.;  London, the most popular European city to visit, holds the world's largestmarathon (April 12 next year). Berlin's race (Sept. 27, 1992) has grown withthe demise of the wall.;""Most marathons take you through cities, so you geta chance to see things you'd never see on a sightseeing bus,"" said Fred Lebow,president of the New York Roadrunner's Club and director of the New YorkMarathon. Lebow has run in 32 marathons, including London, Paris, Rome,Stockholm, Iceland, Seoul and Vienna.;""The most exciting thing is the startof the race,"" he said. ""Each city has something unique."";The cities aredifferent, but most marathons include a carbo-loading pasta party the nightbefore, medical exams, a post-race celebration, commemorative T-shirts andawards to finishers. Entry fees vary; Brussels is $16, Venice $40.;MarathonTours includes the entry price in the package. Going to Bermuda, for example,costs approximately $900 from San Francisco. The price includes round-trip airfare, four days and three nights at the Grotto Bay Beach hotel (per person,based on double occupancy), full breakfasts and dinners, a welcome cocktailparty and post-race parties and discounts.;England has similarorganizations: Sports Tours International and Keith Prowse, a company thatspecializes in British theater, sports and concert tours.;But it isn'tnecessary to run 26.2 miles to go on a running vacation, especially if it's afamily trip. Some marathons, like Portland's, include additional races: afive-mile run, a five-mile walk and a kids run. Tel Aviv has a half-marathonand a fun run. Budapest offers a half-marathon and a mini-marathon along theDanube.;There are also trips that incorporate running into the sightseeingschedule. Running coach Pat Savage and Hal Higdon, a senior writer forRunner's World, are taking a group to Ireland in June. The eight-day trip willleave from Chicago and will include sightseeing, guided runs and a fun runfrom Malahide Castle to Swords.;""On a running vacation you plan somethingaround running everyday,"" Higdon said. ""We know the unique scenic routes andput together special runs."";Some runs are intriguing because of currentevents. The Tel Aviv Marathon course went past houses hit by Scud missilesduring the Gulf War. The Belgrade Marathon was held despite Yugoslavia'sturmoil. The Munich course is the same as the 1972 Olympic route and finishesin the same stadium.;Running 26 miles just to see a city definitely isn'tfor everyone, but at the very least, it's a way to kill two birds with onestone.

29,d094c,"Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxableproperty, a tax office near the Imperial Palace announced Monday.It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed theamount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the KojimachiTax Office said. Until the end of World War II, emperors wereregarded as living gods.Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87. He was succeeded byAkihito, his eldest son. Hirohito's wife, Nagako, became empressdowager.Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his halfof his father's estate, which he divided evenly with his mother. Theempress dowager, as Hirohito's spouse, was exempt from payinginheritance taxes, Kyodo News Service reported.The Japanese constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forcesshortly after the end of World War II in 1945, stipulates theemperor is the symbol of the state and the unity of the people.Hirohito's estate included stocks and other personal belongings.Three sacred treasures  a mirror, sword and jewels  which weretransferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state,the tax office official said.Emperor Hirohito has lost nearly 40 pounds in thetwo months since he fell ill and now weighs only 66 pounds, a palaceofficial was quoted as saying Friday.The 87-year-old emperor's condition weakened Friday, but doctorsspeculated that a scab had stopped internal bleeding in his upperintestinal area, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman KenjiMaeda.Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has notdischarged blood in nine days.The emperor responds to queries from aides but is lesstalkative than before, Maeda told reporters. He added that doctorssometimes have trouble determining whether Hirohito is awake.News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito has shed much of hisnormal 104 pounds during his confinement and now weighs about 66pounds.Hirohito had a temperature of 99.1 degrees Friday evening, upslightly from the morning. His normal temperature is about 95.9degrees.Doctors have said he suffers from jaundice and anemia. Maeda saidthe emperor's heart and kidneys were functioning normally.Since Sept. 19, when he was confined to intensive care aftervomiting blood, Hirohito has received 42 pints of blood intransfusions.Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness,and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperorhas pancreatic cancer.U.S. prosecutors pressured Japan's wartime primeminister, Gen. Hideki Tojo, into changing testimony at his trial toavoid incriminating Emperor Hirohito in war crimes, a televisiondocumentary claims.The British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, details of which werereleased Wednesday by its maker Edward Behr, said the U.S.prosecutors worked with the emperor's aides to find a way to avoidputting Hirohito on trial.The documentary challenges Hirohito's image as a peaceful manforced to go along with his generals' plans and alleges among otherthings that he:Must have known about the massacre of at least 20,000 Chinese atNanking in 1937 because he received regular detailed reports fromthe China front.Knew more than a month in advance of Japanese plans to attackthe U.S. navy at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.The BBC will show Hirohito  Behind the Myth on Jan. 24.Behr is a Paris-based journalist. His biography of China's lastmonarch was used for the award-winning film The Last Emperor.It has been reported previously that American prosecutors wantedto keep Hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked Tojo tosuggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on theadvice of the High Command.Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces occupyingJapan, wrote in his book Reminiscences that he fended offpressure from Britain and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito,arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war.Behr told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesdaythat the documentary will be shown in the United States by PBS onMarch 13.The BBC has also sold it to Australia, Austria, Canada, HongKong, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.Hirohito died Saturday at the age of 87.The documentary says the decision not to prosecute Hirohito camefrom President Harry S. Truman and that Tojo's evidence was alteredso the emperor would not be incriminated.To the rest of the world, he was known as EmperorHirohito, but in Japan his given name was seldom used. In Japanesehe was simply called Tenno Heika, meaning His Majesty The Emperor.The foreign habit of using his name rankled some Japanese, whofound it impolite, and unnecessary since to them there is only oneemperor. Some Japanese complained that after his death it evenbecame inaccurate to call him Hirohito because he has been given theposthumous name Showa.In Japanese histories, he will be recorded as Emperor Showa, thename he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926. Itmeans Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded by Heisei, orAchieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign ofHirohito's son Akihito a few hours after the emperor died Jan. 7.But for the convenience of the rest of the world, which is not soable to keep track of the person behind the changed name, evenofficial agencies have used the name Hirohito in English-languagepublications.The obituary issued in English by the Foreign Press Center, whichis supported by the Foreign Ministry, was headed His late MajestyThe Emperor Hirohito.English-language newspapers published in Japan quickly beganusing the name Showa for Hirohito after his death, but it did notbecome truly official until Jan. 31, when Emperor Akihito conducteda ceremony in which Showa became the late emperor's posthumous name.A stone tablet placed in his tomb is engraved only with theposthumous name and the dates of his death and burial.The custom of renaming emperors after the completion of theirreigns began after the death in 1912 of Emperor Meiji, Hirohito'sgrandfather.In Japan, years are numbered according to the emperor's tenure onthe throne. Thus 1926 became Showa 1 as Crown Prince Hirohitoascended to the throne on Dec. 25 when his father, Emperor Taisho,died. The year 1927 was Showa 2, and 1989 was Showa 64 untilHirohito's death on Jan. 7. Now this year is Heisei 1.The Japanese custom of changing imperial names is not uniqueamong world royalty, where an individual may have a variety of namesand titles in a royal career. In Britain, Prince Andrew became theDuke of York upon his marriage in 1986.Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure and pulse droppedsharply Thursday, but the vital signs later returned to normal asthe ailing monarch's internal bleeding continued.Hirohito, 87, discharged more blood and was given emergencytransfusions, but was resting peacefully by nightfall, an imperialpalace spokesman said.Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60 in the afternoonto 112 over 50 by evening, and his pulse from 104 per minute in themorning to 84 in the evening, said Kenji Maeda, chief of theImperial Household Agency's General Affairs Division.The emperor's blood pressure has returned to what is normalfor him, and the head court physician says he is not worried,Maeda said.One of Hirohito's daughters, Atsuko Ikeda, said Wednesday theemperor had coughed severely during her visit to him and had hardlyresponded to her.On Thursday morning, Hirohito's two sons, Crown Prince Akihitoand Prince Hitachi, visited him, and he was fully conscious andalert, a senior palace source said.The monarch has been bedridden for a month with an intestinalhemorrhage.There was renewed bleeding Thursday and the pace of thedischarges was quickening, Maeda said.Hirohito has received nearly 22{ pints of blood since hisillness worsened Sept. 19, and the transfusions had put a strain onHirohito's heart and kidneys, Maeda said without elaborating.The only solid food Hirohito has eaten since falling ill are afew spoonfuls of porridge. Otherwise he is being fed intravenously,which gives him 600-700 calories a day, said the senior palaceofficial, who refused to be identified.Before his illness, Hirohito was taking about 1,300 caloriesdaily, the official said.The emperor complains of fatigue but does not appear to be inpain, he said.Crown Princess Michiko, Hirohito's daughter-in-law, scaled downcelebrations for her 54th birthday Thursday, canceling atraditional birthday news conference, another palace official said.She planned a quiet gathering with members of the imperial family,the official said.World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences and somedeclared states of mourning after Emperor Hirohito's death Saturday,but painful memories of World War II still generated criticism ofthe Japanese monarch.President Reagan said Hirohito's 62-year reign spanned one ofthe most tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras inthe history of mankind.It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majestyplayed a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our twopeoples to an end, Reagan said, referring to Hirohito's decisionto end World War II.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union sent hissincere condolences and profound sympathy to the Japanesepeople.His two-sentence telegram made no mention of wartime hostilitieswith what still is known officially as militarist Japan. TheKremlin currently is striving for better ties and increased tradewith Japan.India declared a three-day national state of mourning in honor ofHirohito and Norway's King Olav V announced a three-week courtmourning. President Francois Mitterrand of France opened aninternational conference on chemical weapons with a minute ofsilence.But some reaction to Hirohito's death was cool in South Korea,which endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan.While President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea sent his condolences,a government party statement added, We reserve further comment,considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japanrelationship.China extended condolences and Taiwan said it will send adelegation to the funeral.But Taiwan's daily United Evening News said:It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the UnitedStates and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word toChina to show his sorrow.Most historians believe Hirohito was a powerless figurehead buthad approved orders that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor and putmost of East Asia under an often brutal Japanese rule. Hirohitocalled on his nation to surrender in 1945.The emperor's death drew mixed reaction in the Netherlands, whichlost more than 20,000 people under Japan's wartime occupation of theformer Dutch East Indies.The government said it sent its sympathy for the loss that hasbefallen the Japanese people, without mentioning the name ofHirohito, branded a war criminal by survivors of the wartimeoccupation of the colony that became Indonesia in 1949.To many war victims, only now has World War II finally come toan end, said Gen. Ruud Boekholt, chairman of the August 15Commemoration Foundation, a group representing 127,000 Dutchcitizens who underwent Japanese internment.Daily, they still feel the pain of the wartime suffering thatwas inflicted on them in the name of Emperor Hirohito, Boekholttold The Associated Press.But Indonesian President Suharto cabled his condolences to CrownPrince Akihito, Hirohito's eldest son who immediately ascended theChrysanthemum Throne, and said he will personally pay the lasthomage to Hirohito, presidential spokesman Moerdiono said.Pope John Paul II expressed his condolences and sent telegrams toHirohito's family, Vatican radio reported.Queen Elizabeth II said she was saddened and Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher said she shares the Japanese people's sorrow. Butopposition lawmakers said Britain should boycott his funeral.No one should go to that funeral from this country, said RonBrown, a lawmaker of the opposition Labor Party, who denouncedHirohito as a war criminal of the worst kind.It would be a grave insult to the many men and women ...imprisoned in slave camps, he said. Many of them died, but thosewho survived still suffer today.King Juan Carlos of Spain, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and otherPersian Gulf monarchs, King Birendra of Nepal and Sultan MahmoodIskandar of Malaysia also sent condolences to Akihito.Brazil called Hirohito a superior symbol of the Japanesenation, its culture and its anxieties in a period of drastictransformations in the world and his country and in a time of gravenew challenges in the world.World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mournedtoday's death of Emperor Hirohito, who surrendered a broken nationto the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economicpre-eminence.Reaction to Hirohito's death at age 87, however, was decidedlycool in several Asian countries, including South Korea, whichendured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan.While South Korea President Roh Tae-Woo sent his condolences, agovernment party statement added, We reserve further comment,considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japanrelationship.The main opposition party led by Kim Dae-jung said, We havecomplex feelings at the death of Hirohito in view of Japan's 20-yearrule over Korea during his reign.A leading newspaper in Seoul, The Joong-Ang Daily News, wrotethat Hirohito's death reminds all the Korean people of a disgracedperiod and ... humiliation. ... Hirohito is the symbolic figure whomust assume most and final responsibility for (Japan's) preposterouscrimes to the Korean people.Korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalistsouth in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's rule thatbegan in 1910 with Japan's forced annexation of the peninsula.There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinesegovernment because of the lack of diplomatic relations betweenTaiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily UnitedEvening News said:Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion ofJapan's militarists during World War II may bury their animositywith Hirohito's death. ... Chinese suffered the most from theJapanese invasion.It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the UnitedStates and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word toChina to show his sorrow.Now, Hirohito has died. We may not want tocollect the reparations, but we shall never forget the painfulhistoric lessions.In the United States, President Reagan said in a statement, HisMajesty's 62-year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yetat the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind  anage of unprecedented economic collapse, a most vicious war,astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic political andsocial changes throughout the world.It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majestyplayed a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our twopeoples to an end, Reagan said, referring to Hirohito's decisionto end World War II.In New Zealand, Prime Minister David Lange said Hirohito's deathmarks the end of an era.During his reign he saw the transition from the most turbulentperiod in Japan's modern history to the stability and prosperity oftoday, Lange said.President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines sent condolences tothe imperial family and her foreign secretary, Raul Manglapus, aJapanese prisoner of war during World War II, praised Hirohito asa stabilizing factor in the creation of a democratic Japan.He provided a figurehead that kept the Japanese people firmlycommitted to peaceful means of achieving their national goals,Manglapus said.Condolences also came from King Sultan Mahmood Iskandar ofMalaysia to Hirohito's oldest son, Crown Prince Akihito, whoimmediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne.Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia paid his respects in amessage to Japanese Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita: Throughouthis long life, the emperor was held in the highest esteem by hispeople. Now, as Japan enters a period of mourning and prepares for anew age, our thoughts are with you.But Bruce Ruxton, an official of the Returned Services League,which representing almost 300,000 Australian war veterans, saidthere would not be too many tears shed around the world. Hedescribed Hirohito, whose role in the war has been debated, as oneof the worst war criminals.Marine biologists paid homage to another facet of the monarch'slife  his 12 books published on hydrozoa, or sea animals. RobertHessler of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,Calif., said Hirohito preferred the quiet study to his destined roleas leader.The poor man didn't really get to do what he wanted to do. Hehad to be emperor first, then second a scientist and normal humanbeing, Hessler said.TOKYO (AP  Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for oneoverwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must bow todefeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacificconflict in World War II.Shortly after that decision, and for most of his reign, Hirohitobecame a figurehead, isolated from his subjects by tradition andsteeped in his great love, the study of marine biology. He was thelast survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era.But in his first 20 years, the Son of Heaven was worshiped asa divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu.The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which sointrigued Hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man whobecame the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of25 on Christmas Day 1926, designating his reign Showa enlightened peace.The emperor was generally portrayed as having played nosignificant role in planning or carrying out Japan's militaryadventures in the 1930s and 1940s. But it was his first effectivedecision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacificconflict.On Aug. 10, 1945, four days after history's first atomic bombdevastated Hiroshima and one day after a U.S. bomber dropped thesecond atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the generals and admirals ofImperial Japan's wartime government argued for hours in thesweltering bombproof shelter beneath the Tokyo palace.Should Japan agree to the Allies' surrender demand, or fight onuntil annihilation?Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow andobviously nervous monotone, Hirohito, the spiritual and titularleader, offered his opinion for the first time. He spoke of hissorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war, and offamilies who lost everything in air raids.I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer, hesaid. Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and torelieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it isburdened.Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor Meiji,whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japaneseisolation from the outside world, Hirohito told the officers:The time has come when we must bear the unbearable.In the days that followed, Hirohito continued his break withtradition. In a national radio broadcast Aug. 15  the first timeordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice  he personallyannounced the decision to surrender.He told the ravaged nation that the war situation has developednot necessarily to our advantage.Three weeks later, Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat, stripedtrousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. Douglas A.MacArthur, at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. It was the first timeHirohito had ever gone to see anyone, and the first of several callson the general who had led the Pacific war against Japan and becameits postwar governor.On New Year's Day 1946, at MacArthur's insistence, the emperorpublicly renounced his divinity. It was a choice that enabledHirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assuredthat he would not face charges as a war criminal, as some abroad haddemanded.It also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as thisgentle, shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as aliving god.The emperor's status in the eyes of many Japanese changed to thatof a kind uncle.He became a widely respected authority on marine biology. Hepossessed rare collections of marine life, discovered severalspecies himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books onhydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty.In recent years, his life had become the subject of a popularcomic book series.Still, Hirohito and the imperial system remained important toJapan.A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun inMarch 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polledsupported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it shouldbe abolished. Five percent said the emperor should have more power.From 1946 to 1954, Hirohito toured Japan to encourage the peopleto rebuild.The Imperial Household Agency, which ran his affairs, saidHirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfillingtimes of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recoveryfrom a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives.Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, Hirohitoremained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency.Protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibitedfrom speaking on any controversial subject.Hirohito was born on April 29, 1901. In accordance with age-oldimperial custom, he was taken from his parents as an infant to bereared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for onerole, that of emperor.His education came as Japan surged into the modern world. Thefeudal samurai ethic was still strong; when his grandfather died,Gen. Maresuke Nogi, the mentor for the 11-year-old prince, calmlycommitted ritual suicide to follow the emperor, his master, to thegrave.Hirohito studied government and law with private tutors. When hewas 20, his father, Emperor Taisho, sent him abroad  the first timeany member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outsideJapan.Hirohito visited England, Scotland, France, Belgium, theNetherlands and Italy, receiving various decorations. He was alsoreceived by Pope Benedict XV.The young man handled money for the first time, paying his ownfare on the Paris subway. He developed a passion for bacon and eggsand it became a lifelong breakfast habit. A palace chamberlain saidin a 1980 interview that Hirohito shunned Japanese food unless itis forced on him by an unwitting host.Hirohito also acquired a preference for Western clothes. He wasnever seen in public wearing traditional Japanese garb, and a palaceofficial confided that the Emperor of Japan did not even own akimono.Hirohito became prince regent on Nov. 25, 1921, after his fatherbecame a mental and physical invalid, became emperor five yearslater and was formally enthroned in 1928.","AP890821-0100,AP881118-0104,AP890112-0071,AP890224-0003,AP881020-0157,AP890107-0119,LA012289-0055,AP890107-0039,AP890107-0016",Asians Cool to Hirohito's Death; U.S. Possibly Helped Emperor Avoid Trial,"Japan's Emperor Hirohito, renamed Showa after his Jan. 7 death, reigned for 62 years.

30,d087d,"The Summer Olympics will be rememberedfor moments of glory like that enjoyed by U.S. diver Greg Louganisand the startling moment of disgrace when the gold was strippedfrom Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.The Soviet Union won the first U.S.-Soviet Olympic medal contestsince 1976, getting 55 gold medals to 37 for East Germany and 36for the United States. Host South Korea rose to fourth in the worldwith 12 golds.The fear of terrorism and massive civil unrest promptedextraordinary security, but neither bogey materialized as nearly10,000 athletes from 160 countries tested their mettle in 16 daysof competition ended Sunday.As always, there were shining moments of glory, from an openingceremony with exotic dancers and parachutists to a closing withhugs and tears, fireworks and dances, and the mascots of Seoul andBarcelona, the site of the 1992 Games, floating together into thestarry night.Louganis claimed his second pair of gold medals after hittinghis head on a springboard. He said he talked with his coach aboutquitting the Olympics after hitting the board and opening a cutthat needed five stitches to close.We walked and discussed all the things we had gone through toget there, he said. I decided to stay in, and I'm glad I did.Louganis said Sunday he is retiring from diving to begin anacting career.What had been the highest moment of the Games  Ben Johnsonrocketing to victory over U.S. great Carl Lewis in a 100-meter dashworld record  led to the deepest pain when the Canadian was caughtcheating with muscle-building anabolic steroids.Twenty years from now, when most of the records set in Seoul arebroken, the impact of Johnson's disgrace will still be felt ifathletes and trainers heed the events here and end doping.There have been high points and some low points, and the mostimportant low point was Ben Johnson, Juan Antonio Samaranch,president of the International Olympic Committee, said today.That was indeed a blow.But catching Johnson and expelling him and nine other athleteswith positive drug tests was an indication that we have won thebattle against doping, Samaranch said.Sports officials from the United States and the Soviet Union onSunday announced Sunday they would join forces to work towards theelimination of drugs from sport.A statement issued by the U.S. and Soviet Olympic committeessaid the groups would investigate using the exchange of testingteams, lab results and technical data; education programs; anduniform penalties.For the United States, a serious problem at the Seoul Games wasa rising tide of anti-American sentiment.It was exacerbated by NBC's coverage, which the Koreans saw asanti-Korean and insensitive to local culture; the arrest of severalAmerican athletes; and the perceived rudeness of the U.S. team atthe opening ceremony.The Soviets, meanwhile, cultivated friendship by bringing in theBolshoi Ballet, the Moscow Philharmonic, films, a photo exhibit andcopies of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.The announcement of an unprecedented sports exchange programbetween South Korea and the Soviet Union and the arrival of thefirst Soviet diplomats since World War II also warmed relations.Soviet athletes, as they did in Calgary, Canada, during theWinter Games, made a special effort to meet with local people.American athletes tended to isolate themselves.All those differences became apparent at the sporting events,where Koreans often cheered louder for the Soviets or East Germansthan they did for Americans, despite a close 40-year relationshipwith the United States.Still, there were Louganis and other Americans to unabashedlycheer for  like sisters-in-law Florence Griffith Joyner and JackieJoyner-Kersee, who led an assault on the track and field recordbooks, and Louganis.Griffith Joyner won golds in the 100, the 200 and the 400-meterrelay, and silver in the 1,600-meter relay. She set a world recordin the 200 and an Olympic record in the 100. Joyner-Kersee won twogolds, taking the heptathlon with a world record 7,291 points andthe long jump with an Olympic mark of 24 feet, 3{ inches.The 1988 Summer Olympics, kept free ofterrorism but tainted by drug scandals, closed Sunday with thepealing of a medieval bell to symbolize the sorrow of parting. TheUnited States finished third in medals.The 1,000-year-old, 72-ton Emille Bell, which according toKorean legend has the saddest tone of any in the world, tolledfarewell to the more than 9,000 athletes from 160 nations whoparticipated in the 24th Olympiad.The 16-day event, conducted under extraordinary security,wrapped up with the Soviet Union winning the lion's share of the237 medals events.The Soviets took home 132 medals, including 55 gold, the mostever in a Summer Olympics without a major-power boycott. EastGermany had 102 medals and 37 gold, and the United States 94 medalsand 36 gold.Many felt that the United States was robbed of a second-placetie for golds when judges awarded a bout to a South Korean boxerover American Roy Jones in the 156-pound event on the final day ofcompetition.Because of boycotts in 1980 and 1984, the Games were the firstmeeting between the Soviet Union and the United States since 1976in Montreal, and matchups between the two nations provided some ofthe Games' highlights.The U.S. men's volleyball team beat the Soviets to defend its1984 Olympic championship, providing consolation for America'supset in the men's basketball quarterfinals. America also defeatedthe Soviets in women's basketball and men's water polo.At least 1 billion people watched the Olympics via a 115-nation,worldwide TV hookup. The Seoul Games had the greatest number ofathletes (9,633), the most countries, the most gold medals and themost venues (34).Communist North Korea, which demanded a role in the Games,boycotted them, but the only sports power to follow suit was Cuba.Among the highlights:Greg Louganis won the Olympic Spirit Award as top Americanathlete Sunday for winning gold medals in platform and 3-meterspringboard diving. He accomplished the same feat in 1980 andbecame the first man to sweep the events twice.The 28-year-old Louganis, who hit his head on the board in thepreliminaries and received five stitches, announced his retirementfrom diving and said he wanted to pursue acting.Sisters-in-law Florence Griffith Joyner and JackieJoyner-Kersee led an American assault on the record books in trackand field.Griffith Joyner won golds in the 100, the 200 and the 400-meterrelay, and silver in the 1,600-meter relay. She set a world recordin the 200 and an Olympic record in the 100. Joyner-Kersee won twogolds, taking the heptathlon with a world record 7,291 points andthe long jump with an Olympic mark of 24 feet, 3{ inches.Kristin Otto of East Germany won six golds in swimming.American swimmer Matt Biondi won seven medals, five gold, whileJanet Evans earned three golds in the pool for the United States.Daniela Silivas of Romania dominated women's gymnastics,winning three golds, two silvers and a bronze.West German Steffi Graf completed tennis's first Golden Slam,winning the gold medal as well as all four Grand Slam tournaments Wimbledon and the U.S., French and Australian Opens  in a calendaryear.There were low moments as well.Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, the most prominent of 10 athleteswho tested positive for drugs, was stripped of his gold medal inthe 100 meters and title of world's fastest man, and flew home indisgrace, his career in jeopardy. He was accused of usingmuscle-building steroids.Four other medals  two Bulgarian weightlifting golds, aHungarian weightlifing silver and a British judo bronze  also werestripped for drugs, and five non-medalists tested positive forsubstances ranging from caffeine to diuretics.Early in the Games, five people connected to the Korean boxingteam were suspended for attacking a New Zealand referee after aKorean lost a decision to a Bulgarian. Another Korean boxer stageda 67-minute sit-in in the ring to protest his loss. AnthonyHembrick, a U.S. boxer expected to win a gold, never got to fight;his coach misread the schedule and he missed the bus to the arena.Two gold medal-winning U.S. swimmers were arrested for carryinga stone lion's head out of a hotel bar, but charges were dropped.American runner Johnny Gray kicked a taxicab in an argument withits driver. He was arrested and released.Security measures against the possibility of terrorism wereextraordinary, including metal detectors, numerous checkpoints andID cards, but except for scattered protests by student radicals,the Games proceeded without incident.At the closing ceremonies, before the great torch wasextinguished, Korea passed the Olympic flag to representatives fromBarcelona, site of the 1992 Games.Time ran out for the U.S. athletes whenthe Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by BrentRushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speedskater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Gamesshowing in 52 years. Two of the six were gold medals, won by BrianBoitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed skating. Blairalso won a bronze in speed skating, making her America's onlydouble winner.The Olympics wrapped up Sunday evening with a rousing closingceremony before 60,000 people in McMahon Stadium. The 250 figureskaters who performed included past and present medal winners aswell as young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992Winter Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summerGames.Athletes marched in carrying miniature Olympic torches, andbanners reading Until We Meet Again in eight languages weredraped along the top of the stands.Earlier Sunday, Rushlaw and his three team members missedwinning the first U.S. bobsled medal in 32 years when they wasbeaten by .02 seconds for the bronze.Van Gennip took more than six seconds off her own world recordin the 5,000 meters to win her third gold medal. American MaryDocter was 22.87 seconds behind. East Germans finished 2-3 in therace.Finland won the hockey silver medal, handing the Soviets theirfirst loss of the Games, 2-1. The Soviets clinched the gold medalFriday night, and America finished seventh for the second straighttime.In 1936, America won just four medals, but only 51 wereavailable then. This time, 138 medals were handed out.The Soviets finished first in both number of gold medals, with11, and total medals, with 29, a record for the Winter Olympics.East Germany's athletes won nine golds, 25 overall; whileSwitzerland's team came in third in both gold medals, five, andoverall medals, 15.Four other teams also bested the United States in terms ofoverall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.The late Jesse Owens, whose performance at the1936 Olympics put the lie to Hitler's boasts of racial superiority,picked up a fifth gold medal Wednesday for humanitariancontributions in the race of life.President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to hiswidow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attendedby three daughters and teammates of the track legend.This Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of Owens' death at age66.The president later hailed Owens's multiple gold medals in theBerlin games a victory for humanity in prepared remarks to abanquet sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee.The Olympics, like democracy, are a kind of dialogue  a waythat nations can converse in the language of friendly competition,not deadly conflict, Bush said.Bush called Owens, who was black, an Olympic hero and anAmerican hero every day of his life ... born with the gift ofburning speed.He was always the fastest, said Bush, recalling theafternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three worldrecords and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes.Talk about a guy in a hurry, Bush laughed. He was theepitome of that.At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens captured four goldmedals  in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and400-meter relay.The Berlin Games were to be the showcase of Hitler's theorieson the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kidshowed up, Bush said. It was an unrivaled athletic triumph. Butmore than that, it really was a triumph for all humanity.Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not thoseathletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race oflife that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.Owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as aspecial ambassador for sports, said Bush. He said the athlete'slegacy lives on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playgroundOlympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletesand the Jesse Owens Foundation, which awards scholarships to needyyouth.Despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came fromhis work with youth, said Mrs. Owens, 74.Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were formerOlympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; formerteammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and twoOhio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, whospearheaded the drive to strike the medal.The silver-haired Mrs. Owens, standing outside the White Houseafterwards, called the event absolutely beautiful. She added:I'm sure with the sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us,too.The 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't even over when advertisers began clamoring for pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton. She went on to grin relentlessly through some $5 million worth of commercial endorsements -- surely an Olympic record in itself. But when the 1988 Summer Games ended Sunday night, so, too, did the chance for American athletes to follow in her footsteps. Ad agency executives, who spend every fourth year glued to their TV sets, hoping to pick out the next star to hawk their clients' products, say that this Olympiad was a dud. ""I suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the Olympics,"" says Jerry Della Femina, chairman of ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS. ""This is the first Olympics without passion, and without passion you don't have testimonials. Without heroes, you don't have anyone that anyone wants to emulate."" On the surface, the Games seemed to offer all the drama that usually makes for lucrative endorsement contracts. Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking his head on the springboard, then coming back to win two gold medals? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, her two-inch fingernails raking the air as she won the 100-meter sprint? But even these two, along with Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won the women's heptathalon and the long jump, may find it more difficult than in previous years to turn gold medals into gold in the bank. The fact is, say many marketers, Olympic gold has lost much of its commercial luster. ""I don't think it's big money like it used to be,"" says Michael Goldberg of National Media Group Inc., the New York sports-marketing firm that represents Ms. Retton. ""It used to be kind of a knee-jerk reaction to do an ad campaign around an Olympic athlete. It just doesn't happen anymore."" Certainly, this year's winning Olympians will have no trouble securing contracts from specialized sports-equipment outfitters and speaking invitations from obscure trade groups. But the major, high-paying endorsements -- such as those with soft-drink companies and fast-food outlets -- just don't seem to be surfacing, at least not yet. Earlier this year, sports marketers estimated that a gold medal won during the Summer Games could earn a personable athlete more than $1 million in endorsements. Now, marketers say, these medalists will be lucky to pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year. Advertisers can reel off a litany of reasons why these Olympics aren't igniting much spark. For one thing, they suffer by comparison with the 1984 Summer Games, so exciting because they were held in Los Angeles and because, in the absence of boycotting Soviet-bloc countries, the Americans won 83 gold medals. The 1988 Games, by contrast, were broadcast from halfway around the world, and the Soviets trounced the Americans, 55 gold medals to 36. What's more, marketers say, this year's drug scandals cast a pall over the Games, especially the incident involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who lost his gold medal after testing positive for steroids. NBC's TV coverage also gets its share of the blame. Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build. The constant commercial interruptions, which led to ratings that were much lower than expected, didn't help, either. During most of the past Games, ""there was enough continuous TV coverage so that, much like a soap opera, it was possible to get involved in the lives and in the competition,"" says Leigh Steinberg, attorney for ice-skater Brian Boitano, a gold medalist at the 1988 Winter Games. But not this summer, he says. Recent changes in Olympic rules, meanwhile, have led to a glut of Olympians in search of endorsement deals. Before the 1984 Games, most Olympic athletes weren't allowed to make commercials unless they gave up their amateur status. Now, they can appear in as many ads as they want, but the income must go into a trust fund for training expenses. ""Every year, more and more Olympic people are out there wanting to do commercials -- basically, everybody is available,"" says Daisy Sinclair, a vice president with ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As a result, while once an ""aura"" surrounded an Olympian, now ""the bloom is off."" Companies also are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to celebrity endorsements. Increasingly cost conscious, they will no longer hook up with an Olympian just because the company president likes the athlete's sport. And after years of paying big bucks to Olympic stars only to see them fade into obscurity, companies have finally gotten the hint that Olympian fame is of the most fleeting variety. ""If you think your phone will ring off the hook if (you win) a gold medal, it isn't going to happen anymore,"" says Stephen Disson, senior vice president of marketing for ProServ Inc., a Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies now know that ""six months from now there will be other heroes from other sporting events"" for them to consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude toward the Olympics is becoming typical. It uses sports stars in its commercials for Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds but has no plans to call on any of 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer to use athletes who are in the public eye on a regular basis, like football and basketball players,"" says Charles Miesmer, the agency's executive creative director. ""People like Michael Jordan have 10-plus years in their sports careers, all in a row, so I don't have to worry about the public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And don't look for any of 1988's winners to start showing up on Wheaties boxes, either. General Mills Inc., which has featured Ms. Retton and decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner on its Wheaties boxes in the past, says it looks for three qualities in an endorser: career achievement, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishments. A spokeswoman says that none of this year's crop meet all three criteria. So far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee has had the most visible endorsements. Even before the Olympics began, she had made commercials for Primatene mist and 7-Up. And, according to her agent, Pearl Hodge of World Class Management, she is now ""in the process"" of signing with McDonald's Corp., to work on behalf of its efforts to aid underprivileged children. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take the endorsement lead. Advertisers say with her good looks and fashion flare, she is attracting more interest than any of the other medal winners. (The sprinter's manager couldn't be reached for comment.) Another Olympian with endorsement potential is swimmer Matt Biondi, who won five gold medals. Mr. Biondi has already signed a swim-wear contract with Arena USA Inc., and Parkes Brittain, his agent at Advantage International Inc., says his client ""will definitely be in a high-income ring, the highest you can name."" Then there is Mr. Louganis. Since winning two gold medals during the 1984 Summer Olympics, the diver has had little luck with major endorsements. And a few marketing executives say that even his second sweep of the diving events may not up his potential. ""When most advertisers are looking for the male hero, the word 'macho' trails along very closely,"" says Marty Blackman of Blackman & Raber, a sports-marketing firm in New York.

Back to school, said Thomas, who won the bronzemedal despite three faulty landings. I'm not going to make anyexcuses. I was really skating well this week. It wasn't supposed tohappen, I guess. But I tried.While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout tomusic from Bizet's Carmen, Manley was so sensational in thefreestyle that she finished first with seven judges. Combined witha fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in theshort program earlier in the week, the performance put Manley insecond place.Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became thefirst repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic goldin 1948 and '52. Sonja Henie of Norway was the only woman to do itbefore Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S.figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion, skated poorlySaturday after doing well earlier in the Games.By contrast, Manley had the sellout crowd at the OlympicSaddledome enraptured. They cheered, hooted and stamped their feetwhen she finished hitting every element of her program.Jill Trenary of Minnetonka, Minn., finished fourth. She wasfifth heading into the long program, worth 50 percent of theoverall score.Thomas' bronze was the third figure skating medal here for theUnited States. Brian Boitano won the men's crown, and a bronze inpairs went to Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard.In addition to the three figure skating medals, the U.S. teamhad three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze.Speed skater Bonnie Blair, America's only double medalist, triedagain Saturday in the 1,500 meters but finished fourth, well offthe pace. She won the gold in the 500 and the bronze in the 1,000meters.As the Olympics winded up its next-to-last day, the Soviet Unionhad 27 medals, including 11 golds, while East Germany in secondplace had 22, including nine golds.Florence Griffith Joyner twice smasheda world record Thursday as she blazed to a gold medal in the200-meter sprint.She also stayed on target to become the second woman to win fourtrack and field gold medals in a single Olympics.Griffith Joyner dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds,shattering the world mark she had set just 90 minutes earlier inher semifinal heat. In that race, she ran 21.56, eclipsing the9-year-old mark of 21.71 set in 1979 by Marita Koch of East Germanyand equaled three times since.In her 200 quarterfinal heat Wednesday, Griffith Joyner ran anOlympic record 21.76 seconds.Griffith Joyner, who set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the100 meters, had a big lead Thursday as she turned the curve for thefinal 100 meters. She glided to the wire.I know I can run much faster, she said. I felt veryrelaxed. That's the key.Griffith Joyner, 28, is scheduled to run in the 400-meter relaySaturday and may compete in the 1,600-meter relay that day.Noted for her long, painted fingernails and racy, colorfulbodysuits, Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles has a chance to match the1984 quadruple gold medal performance of U.S. sprinter and longjumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in1948.TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by thefour relay finals. Tonight it is nation versus nation.What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event isthat at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries -or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resources on athletes.The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, theformer Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six wonbefore 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands(nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa). The Dutch, withone, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and SouthAmerica (nil) combined. The Cuban women's 100 metres relay teams of 1968 and1972 are the only women from outside the developed world to have won relaymedals.With a little luck - with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relaysalways require a little luck - the developing countries will continue thegentle redistribution of medals. But although they have talent, few canmatch the strength in depth of the traditional relay powers.The US 4x400m squad has been weakened by the injury to Danny Everett. Evenso they rested Steve Lewis, the 400m silver medallist, in last night'ssemi-finals. In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewisran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue hiseighth Olympic gold.One thing that became clear on Thursday, when Lewis won his seventh goldwith victory in the long jump, was that while winning at the Olympics maybring other athletes excitement or relief, Lewis simply adores theexperience.When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after thewomen's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that shehad won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did theother 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.Lewis, on the other hand, seemed unsurprised when Mike Powell was unable tooverhaul him in the long jump. Even though the long jump had not finishedand even though 5,000m runners were trudging through a semi-final, Lewisbegan at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour.He tried to orchestrate a Mexican wave. This is a man who derives immensepleasure from winning in front of a packed house. Lewis will be difficult tosuppress tonight.Noureddine Morcelli of Algeria will be hard to beat in the men's 1,500m.Morcelli is one of five Africans in the final striving to increase theircontinent's tally of just three Olympic medals (all Kenyan) in this event.Even here there is a US connection: Morcelli attended Riverside CommunityCollege in California, to hone his running on good tracks.On Thursday night, Morcelli cruised through his heat in first place afterthe gentlest push on the accelerator. The Moroccan Rachid Al-Basir followedhim down the straight, a respectful step behind, looming over his fellowArab and glancing anxiously round like a bodyguard. Morcelli has not beenbeaten in the 1,500m since 1990.","AP881003-0066,LA082889-0067,AP881002-0048,AP880228-0097,AP900328-0128,WSJ881004-0111,AP880228-0013,AP880929-0042,LA040790-0121,FT923-8765",International and Olympic gold eludes or elates competitors and nations.,"International athletic competition, particularly the Olympics, can bring glory and wealth to some.  It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing groupof runners in those events.In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured manysuccessful Olympic athletes.",,,,
31,d082a,"Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbeliefSunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of AndreiD. Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described ashis country's conscience.Crimean Tatars and Jewish refuseniks  two of the groupsSakharov helped  joined rank-and-file Communists, teachers andengineers in filing past the body of the physicist, Nobel PeacePrize winner, human rights advocate and legislator.Based on official sources, an estimated 45,000 people filedthrough, and the flow of mourners continued into the night. Afriend of the family, speaking on condition of anonymity, said heheard estimates that 70,000 mourners viewed the body before it wasreturned to Sakharov's apartment at midnight.My God! Forgive us! one elderly woman cried out as she sawSakharov's body in an open coffin, sloping to the floor of thebeige marble Youth Palace in central Moscow. She apparently meantto apologize for not recognizing his contributions earlier.A mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at Sakharov'sfeet, and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing Sakharovwith his hands over his mouth, deep in thought. An organ and pianoalternated dirges.Sakharov died Thursday alone in his study at the age of 68,apparently of a heart attack, ending a three-decade fight againstthe jailing of innocent people, for free emigration, fordisarmament and other causes.Sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies, and theoutpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized andcommitted to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remotecity of Gorky.There were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of 9million people, as though a government leader had died. The hugeline of mourners, sometimes four deep and heavily bundled againstbelow-zero temperatures, stretched a mile from the palace andpoured continuously out of a subway station.So many people wanted to see Sakharov's body lying in state thatauthorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved thecoffin so two rows of mourners could file past.Roald Z. Sagdeyev, a member of the official funeral commission,said about 3,000 people an hour were arriving initially, but theofficial news agency Tass said that rate doubled later, making fora total of 45,000 by nighttime.Police lined the sidewalks where people waited. Sakharov's widowYelena Bonner, pleased authorities were not turning people away,praised them for being very democratic.In her first detailed public comments on her husband's death,Bonner said she hopes he will not be idolized.I would not wish a living person  he has lived an animated,happy life  to be turned into an icon, an icon which could be usedby various forces in their interests, Bonner said in an interviewbroadcast on Soviet TV.She said, however, that she hopes Sakharov's writings, publishedabroad long ago, will become widely available in his homeland sothere can be a conversation of the people of the future withAndrei Dmitrievich.Mourners carried small portraits of Sakharov and red and whitecarnations to place near his coffin. One man, Sergei Kosykh,brought his 7-year-old daughter along.My daughter, who is being brought up with the belief thatthere is nobody greater than (Soviet founder Vladimir) Lenin, Ihave brought her here today just to show her the person greaterthan Lenin, he said.A middle-aged woman drew from Russian literature to reflect onSakharov's contributions.He was like the man from one of Maxim Gorky's tales who usedhis own bleeding and living heart as a torch to lead people tolight and truth, said the woman, a teacher who declined to giveher name.Sakharov always was telling the truth and by doing so forcedour leadership to do the same, said Boris Sorokin, a 50-year-olddesigner.Unofficial shrines sprouted outside Sakharov's southeast Moscowapartment, where candles flickered alongside his portrait. Outsidethe offices of the weekly newspaper Moscow News on Pushkin Square,a popular gathering place for political activists, portraits andflowers were displayed.An entry in a notebook for mourners' comments outside Sakharov'sapartment building declared, The conscience of the nation hasdied.Moscow News  an organ of the official press, which had brandedSakharov an utterly ignorant person  took the rare step Sundayof publishing a special edition devoted to the activist.Four pages were filled with pictures of him, condolencetelegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and PresidentBush and a text of Sakharov's last public remarks, a speech hedelivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviethierarchy was leading the country to a catastrophe.On Sunday night, Soviet TV's newscast Seven Days also paidtribute to Sakharov, leading the program with a 10-minute report onhim.The Communist Party daily Pravda published a poem by YevgenyYevtushenko that read in part:History's most peaceful rebel, in dying, did not come downfrom the cross, but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric ofthe world.On Saturday, Pravda published what amounted to a public apologyto Sakharov.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders said inan obituary that Sakharov had been the victim of grossinjustices and praised him as a man of honesty and sincerity.Bonner, Sakharov's constant companion and fellow human rightsactivist, sat closest to the coffin, clutching a black handbag andperiodically closing her eyes. A son and daughter from his firstmarriage and son and daughter of Bonner also attended, along withfour grandchildren.Gorbachev was expected to pay his last respects Monday, when thefuneral is planned, and on Sunday was represented by Yevgeny M.Primakov, chairman of the funeral commission and a non-votingmember of the country's ruling Politburo.The foreign dignitaries expected to take part in Monday'sceremonies include Lech Walesa, head of Poland's Solidaritymovement, who will be making his first trip to the Soviet Union,and former refuseniks Yosef Begun and Vladimir Slepak, who now livein Israel.Israel's best known Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky, wasrefused a visa when he applied for permission to travel to Moscow,said Sharansky's spokesman, Avraham Ben-Yaakov. Begun and Slepaksaid they would lay a wreath on Sakharov's grave in Sharansky'sname.Soviet media once branded Andrei D. Sakharov atraitor, but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympatheticportrait of the human rights activist and his wife.This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said thatSakharov long ago understood the need for change in the SovietUnion.The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the pastcharges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident YelenaBonner, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media.Moscow News also pointedly notes that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prizewinner has praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for social andeconomic reform.The 66-year-old Sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence intheir seventh-floor Moscow apartment, eating cabbage, beet soup,potatoes and other simple fare, and Sakharov insists on washing thedishes afterward himself, the paper said.It said their two-room home was always filled with peopleseeking Sakharov's aid, and that the words most often heard thereare: Help me. But Moscow News asked: Can he really doeverything?Although the full-page article was the longest on Sakharov todate in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to thenearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing theKremlin's intervention in Afghanistan.Sakharov, a brilliant physicist, was allowed to return to Moscowin December 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city ofGorky, where he was banished without trial in January 1980.In effect, sometimes Sakharov bitterly jokes that he'd like toreturn to Gorky for a few months to be able to work alone onscientific work, Moscow News said. Of course, concerning Gorky,that's a bitter joke.Since his return to Moscow, Sakharov has been a vocal supporterof Gorbachev's program for nationwide reforms that includes thepolicy of glasnost, or greater openness on selected topics.He simply believes that something helped change the thoughtsof the majority into state policy, Moscow News said.He callsperestroika (restructuring) an enormous event for our country andfor the entire world.However, Sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improvingthe Soviet record on human rights, and during a Jan. 15 meeting inthe Kremlin, he handed Gorbachev a list of 200 people he said wereimprisoned for their views.Moscow News noted that in 1975, in a tract titled Knowledgeand the World, Sakharov set forth his views on Soviet affairs.Those writings have not been published in the Soviet Union.Now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then,and those ideas that we are putting forward today, Moscow Newssaid.Sakharov called for a ban on nuclear testing long before theKremlin. The human rights activist, one of the most prominentmembers of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the1970s, sought openness in Soviet society years before glasnostbecame Communist Party policy.Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harmcaused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them.It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living inoriental luxury and engaging in scandals between spouses.Moscow News said Sakharov was stubborn, unassuming, anundisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man withhis own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs andthe demands of this life.His strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he dothe dishes after meals, wrote the reporter who visited Sakharov athis apartment.What is that, Andrei Dmitrievich, your hobby? asked MoscowNews correspondent Gennady Zhavoronkov.Not all guests are able to wash the dishes conscientiously,Sakharov replied.Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Sovietdissident movement, finally received a 1973 human rights awardThursday night during his first trip to New York City.Sakharov received the Human Rights Award from the InternationalLeague for Human Rights at a reception at the home of Ronald Lauder,the former U.S. ambassador to Austria.The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is on his first trip tothe West, less than two years after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevfreed him from internal exile in the city of Gorky. The human rightsactivist was banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing theSoviet occupation of Afghanistan.About 200 guests, including author Elie Wiesel, Brooklyn DistrictAttorney Elizabeth Holtzman, designer Caroline Roehm and ABCtelevision's Barbara Walters, attended the reception.The ceremony was closed to the media. Sakharov, wearing a blueberet and plaid scarf, made no statement as he left the receptionand entered a waiting limousine.Sakharov is the honorary president of the league, which has itsheadquarters in the United States and more than 40 affiliate groupsaround the world, including the Moscow Human Rights Committee, whichSakharov and his colleagues founded in 1971.Sakharov arrived in the United States on Sunday to visitrelatives and receive medical treatment before going to Washingtonfor a White House visit and a board meeting of the InternationalFoundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which heis a director.A Soviet newspaper has painted a highlysympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner,countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded astraitors by the state-run media.But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned thenearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile forcriticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating thattopic is still too sensitive.In its latest issue, the weekly devoted its entire back page todescribing the home life of Sakharov, 66, the 1975 Nobel PeacePrize winner, and said the words most often heard in hisseventh-floor Moscow apartment are help me.Sakharov's apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a meccafor Soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed toreturn from exile in the closed city of Gorky in December 1986.Since then, Sakharov, who was one of the creators of hisnation's hydrogen bomb, has vocally supported Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev's reform campaign, but has called for the liberationof all political prisoners and more improvements in the field ofhuman rights.Past Soviet reports, published before Gorbachev became Sovietleader, accused Bonner of marrying Sakharov for his money and saidthe couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandals betweenspouses.Moscow News depicted the couple as living peacefully andfrugally, eating cabbage, beet soup, potatoes, and other simplefare, and marveled that Sakharov, a member of the prestigiousAcademy of Sciences, always does the dishes himself.While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, theauthor of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious andscandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow Newssaid.Sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposedthat he write an apology for all the lies that were published,the paper said.It reported that when the unidentified author refused, Sakharovsaid, It's too bad that duels are abolished in our times, andslapped him.Sakharov has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media sincehis return from exile, but the article in Moscow News was thelongest devoted to him so far.But most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreigntourists and readers abroad, so relatively few Soviets would seethe Sakharov article. As well as appearing in Russian, Moscow Newsalso prints editions in English, French and other languages.Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy ofSciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates forthe new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel PeacePrize winner.The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, whowon the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that manyscientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved bythe leadership in January.Sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform aremissing from the list. The official news agency Tass quoted him assaying, however, that scientists were upset not because Sakharovwas not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutionswas ignored.He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democraticdecision, which produced a list of what critics describe asold-guard managers of scientific institutions.A vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for Tuesday.Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for aseat in the new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, but hedecided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy ofSciences seat.Under an election law approved in December, 750 seats in thelegislature are reserved for the Communist Party and its affiliatesand for professional, social and trade union organizations. Theother 1,500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 Sovietrepublics and their electoral districts.Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a newround of nominations by mustering enough support to deny allnominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former politicalprisoner.That would force the academy to start over and produce a new listof nominees under terms of the new election law.Twenty-five seats were allotted to the academy, but it gave fiveto affiliated societies and associations. From 121 nominees, theacademy leadership chose 23 candidates for the remaining 20 seats.Although 60 research institutes nominated Sakharov, he was notchosen for the final slate. The leadership's decision inspiredwidespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy'sMoscow headquarters.Tass said 1,108 academicians, corresponding members andrepresentatives of reseach institutes attended the three-day meetingthat began Monday.The first three days of this week may become the `hottest'spring days for Soviet scientists, it said, alluding to theleadership's rejection of such reformers as Sakharov, spacescientist Roald Sagdeev and sociologist Tatyana Zaslavsakaya.The agency acknowledged many scientists were unsatisfied withthe slate of candidates.Mironov said two other academicians also spoke on Monday in favorof new nominations. No details of their remarks were available.In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S.Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov asa man of honesty and sincerity who suffered great injustice atthe hands of previous rulers.An obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other members of theruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials andscholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 ofthe party daily Pravda.Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures andscientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 NobelPeace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of afuneral commission in a black box on its front page.Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hours afterurging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies tocreate a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break itsseven-decade strangehold on political power.A distinguished scientist and public figure, a man of honestyand sincerity has passed away, the obituary said. Everythingthat Andrei Dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience, hisdeep humanitarian convictions.The obituary noted Sakharov was exiled in the industrial city ofGorky about 250 miles east of Moscow from 1980 to 1986.Gross injustices were permitted in relation to A.D.Sakharov, it said.It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members NikolaiI. Ryzhkov, Vadim A. Medvedev, Lev N. Zaikov, Alexander N. Yakovlevand Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.However, the signatures of several other Politburo members,including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservativeYegor K. Ligachev were missing. Absence of their signatures couldsignify that the disagreed with part of the obituary.Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, hadsaid he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.It was Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed by Gorbachev forpermitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system,who exiled Sakharov for criticizing the Soviet intervention inAfghanistan.Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told himhe could return to Moscow.The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of People'sDeputies that Sakharov's death was a great loss.Even though the two often tangled at the Congress, Gorbachevsaid he respected Sakharov. He was not some sort of politicalintriguer, the Soviet president said Friday.Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Mondayafternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.Several hundred people gathered outside Sakharov's apartmentbuilding Friday evening, holding candles and wreathing hisphotograph in flowers. Memorial services were scheduled Sunday atthe city's main youth center, and on Monday at the Lebedev physicsinstitute where Sakharov worked and the Academy of Sciences, ofwhich he was a leading member.The popular nighttime TV program Vzglad showed a briefinterview with his widow, Yelena Bonner, discussing the funeralarrangements.The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist,which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciencesat age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed theSoviet hydrogen bomb.But it said that Sakharov realized the danger of the weapon hehad helped create.Working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction, A.D.Sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wideproduction and testing, and stubbornly placed before the governmentthe question of limiting such tests, it said.But at that time his appeals were not accepted, it said.He kept these same positions in the future.The visit by human rights activist Andrei D.Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by statemedia, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced oppositionto the U.S. Star Wars program.That report from Radio Moscow, carried on itsinternational-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the onlymention made by Soviet media of Sakharov's visit to the UnitedStates, which began Sunday.Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the comments about the Reaganadministration's space-based anti-missile program at a Boston newsconference.Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, is scheduled tospend two weeks visiting relatives in the United States, undergoingmedical tests and promoting a new international organization hebelongs to.A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissidentmovement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internalexile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive intoAfghanistan.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow inDecember 1986. Some statements and articles by Sakharov have beenprinted in the Soviet media since then, including an article lastweek in a magazine that opposed some elements of Gorbachev'sblueprint for political and electoral reforms.Other activities by Sakharov have gone unreported here, includinghis delivery to Gorbachev of a list of 200 Soviets reportedly heldin prison, labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of theirpolitical views.The official Tass news agency reported Wednesday that theorganization Sakharov belongs to  the International Foundation forthe Survival and Development of Humanity  held its first session inBoston the previous day.Tass made no mention of Sakharov in its three-paragragh report,but said the Soviet delegation to the meeting was headed by YevgenyVelikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.","AP891217-0053,LA121589-0192,AP880512-0157,LA051589-0055,AP881110-0227,AP880512-0096,AP890320-0158,AP891216-0037,LA012189-0060,AP881109-0161","Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, Soviet human rights activist, died 1989","Andrei Sakharov, Soviet hydrogen bomb developer and prominent 1970s dissident, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize.

32,d081a,"More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine inthe southern city of Jastrzebie went on strike today to demandlegalization of Solidarity and higher wages, a spokeswoman said.The strike in Jastrzebie, about 275 miles southwest of Warsaw,comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawedtrade federation.Solidarity spokeswoman Katarzyna Ketrzynska said workers on theovernight shift at the Manifest Lipcowy mine stayed outside themine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for themorning shift.She said security officers blocked miners on the afternoonshift, which starts at 2 p.m., from entering the grounds to jointhe striking miners. The strike began at noon today, according toKatrzynska.She said the miners are demanding the legalization of Solidarityand reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. Theworkers are also calling for higher wages and better workingconditions, and are requesting two lawyers and two economists toassist them in the negotiations.Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region ofSilesia to experience unrest.Workers at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw stageda protest rally Monday to demand improved safety conditions and thereturn of Solidarity activists to work. Three members of Solidaritywere barred Saturday from working.Solidarity was crushed in 1981, when the government imposedmartial law, and was banned nearly a year later by parliament.On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around the northern portof Gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, thefirst and only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.More than 10,000 coal miners in fourstates were off the job today to express sympathy for miners inVirginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike sinceApril against the Pittston Coal Group.Miners in Pennsylvania and Kentucky today became the third andfourth states to report walkouts at coal companies. The sympathystrikes began Monday in West Virginia and spread to Indiana lateThursday.One United Mine Workers representative said today that theIndiana walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of CBS'48 Hours, which focused on the Pittston strike, in which 1,600miners have been off the job since April.Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators Associationto negotiate with the union independently, and the two sides havefailed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.UMW officials gave conflicting indications of whether they areresponsible for the wildcat strike. Some said they are asking unionmembers to return to work, but Tommy Buchanan, internationalexecutive board member in UMW District 20 in Birmingham, Ala., saidtoday the final decision on whether 5,000 Alabama miners will jointhe strike will be with union President Richard Trumka.It might be two days. It might be a week. It will startwhenever it comes down from the union president, Buchanan said.Union spokesman Joe Corcoran was not in his office and has notreturned phone calls this week.The head of the coal industry bargaining unit said he had noplans to confer with the Pittston on the wildcat strikes.I would no more try to tell someone else how to run theircompany than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how torun my company, said Robert H. Quenon, president of PeabodyHolding Co., the nation's largest coal producer, and chairman of theBituminous Coal Operators Association.Quenon flew to Charleston from St. Louis on Thursday to meet withreporters and express Peabody's and the association's concerns aboutthe walkout.An estimated 2,300 United Mine Workers members stayed away fromtheir jobs today in Pennsylvania. Most worked for Rochester &Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in central Pennsylvania, where 1,600miners failed to report for work at midnight Thursday, said companyspokesman Hank Waneck said.About 290 miners at Peabody's Camp No. 1 mine in Morganfield,Ky., didn't report for work today, said company spokesman Tom Clarke.At least 270 miners were off the job at two mines in Indianatoday, spokesmen said. Mark Arnold, a spokesman for UMW District 11in Terre Haute, attributed the action to the CBS show.When the miners saw that last night, that kind of set them offto where they decided to walk out, he said.About one-third of West Virginia's 24,000 miners were reportedoff the job today. Some 600 miners in Wise County, Va., who walkedout earlier in the week returned to work this morning.The coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other thanPittston violate a no-strike clause in the 1988 national contractthe union signed with the association. Pittston did not take part inthat agreement.Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but inthe past they have said they have not authorized the walkout.I think the union leadership ought to exercise its leadershiprole and do what they can to lead the miners back to work, Quenonsaid. That's why we have a union. That's why we have an agreementwith the union  to set out the terms and conditions under which wewill have labor to run our coal mines.And we expect that to be honored.BFN[Text] Donetsk Oblast [no date as received] -- As UNIAN reported, miners at the ""Ordzhonikidzevuhillya"" coal production association and the ""Yenakiyevo"" and ""Poltava"" pits went on strike in Yenakiyevo on 27 June, demanding payment of wage arrears. The strike continued at these mines on 28 June. Some of the miners at the Karl Marx, ""Chernovonyy Zhovten,"" ""Chervonyy Profinter,"" and ""Yunkom"" pits joined the strike. A total of 1,200 of the association's 2,248 workers are on strike. A rally consisting of 350 miners was held on 28 June near the town council building where demands were made to pay the wages and dismiss the director general of the ""Ordzhonikidzevuhillya"" production association.A strike committee consisting of 12 persons was elected (one of the members is a former Komsomol leader and former USSR people's deputy Viktor Honcharov) and it was decided to continue the strike until the demands that had been raised have been completely fulfilled.On 28 June, 118 of 258 workers on the second shift at the ""PivdennoDonbass"" mine of the ""Donetskvuhillya"" production association in the town of Ugledar refused to start work for the same reasons -- delay in paying wages. After a meeting with the mine's director, who promised to pay the arrears, the miners on the third shift returned to work.On 27 June, all miners on the fourth shift at the ""Karbomid"" and ""Pervomaysk"" mines in Pervomaysk, Lugansk oblast, refused to start work (142 and 157 miners respectively).In the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wished not to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential elections. According to some reports, among the leaders of the striking pits there are members of the Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Bloc of Reforms.As Kostyantyn Fesenko, chairman of the coal industry workers trade union, informed a UNIAN correspondent, Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, in a telephone conversation on 29 June, gave assurances that the money for the miners' wages as well as subsidies for the following month would be found and forwarded in the next few days.The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation. The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africa's gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines, said Cyril Ramaphosa, the union's general secretary. If workers in mines not included in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes, a total of 300,000 miners could be on strike, he said. Gold and coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign-currency earnings. The union's announcement produced little immediate reaction on South African financial markets, where analysts said a strike had been expected and probably wouldn't have much impact unless it lasted more than a month. Mine owners reportedly have been building stockpiles for several weeks in anticipation of a strike. Mining companies' shares rose along with the price of gold, but the metal's rise came mainly in reaction to increased tensions in the Persian Gulf. The South African rand was slightly firmer. Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding a 30%, across-the-board wage increase for black miners, who the union says earn an average of 225 rand ($109) a month. The Chamber of Mines, which represents the nation's six biggest mining houses, says black miners earn about twice that much. It implemented wage increases ranging from 15% to 23.4% last month. Anglo American Corp., the huge South African mining house, warned against a strike, saying miners had received a good wage increase in July and wouldn't gain further raises by a job action. But ""at this stage it seems the strike seems inevitable,"" said Mr. Ramaphosa, who added that there hadn't been any negotiations with management since a strike ballot received ""overwhelming support"" during the week of July 12. He also warned of possible confrontations with police, saying: ""We have issued instructions to our members that if they are attacked they should defend themselves."" Miners' strikes in recent years have featured clashes with police, leaving dozens of people dead. ""The total mines that will be affected are 28 gold mines around the country and 18 collieries,"" the union official said. ""Our union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies, where strike action could take place at any time, should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members' demands."" He said such other companies included De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's largest diamond miner. In addition to the general wage increase, Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding pay for black miners doing dangerous work. The black miners also are asking for 30 days' leave each year, and a paid holiday on June 16, the anniversary of the 1976 Soweto riots. They also want an increase in death benefits to five years from two.Strikes by tens of thousands ofminers in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of theSoviet Union's coal fields, Tass reported today.The official news agency said coal miners in Vorkuta in the farnorth, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and theUkrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out Wednesday.Miners in the Karaganda region in Soviet Central Asia todayrefused to work, Tass said. By evening, 14 mines in the region, homeof the country's third-largest coal fields, were reported at astandstill.Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking minersin the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greaterlocal control over their industries and better wages and livingconditions.Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, arethe country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to thecountry's worst labor unrest since the 1920s. Novokuznetsk is amajor city in the Kuznetsk region, where the strikes began 10 daysago.The government has acknowledged that living and workingconditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has madegeneral pledges of improvements.Tass reported Wednesday that some miners in Siberia had returnedto work after the government made pay concessions.The government also has promised to send extra meat, butter,sugar, tea, leather shoes, furniture and cars to relieve shortagesin the region, the Communist Youth League newspaper KomsomolskayaPravda said today.But the newspaper and Tass reported more disturbances in theUkraine. Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a communist official in theDonetsk city of Makeyevka as saying, The scale of the strike isgrowing. Practically all the coal enterprises of the city havestopped work.Miners in Vorkuta, Rostov and Dnepropetrovsk all walked off thejob on Wednesday, Tass said.In Vorkuta, strikers sent a letter to the Kremlin asking for anurgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of thecoal sector, and also specific problems of workers of the farnorth, Tass said.In Rostov, miners' economic demands included extra pay forevening and night shifts, longer vacations and an increase in theprice of coal to world market prices, the news agency reported.In Dnepropetrovsk, which is 150 miles from Donetsk, workers'demands mirrored those of Donetsk and Kuznetsk miners.In Karaganda, strikers said they walked out to protest incompletenews accounts of miners' demands in the Kuznetsk strikes, accordingto Tass.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the strikes couldimperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workersbeing urged to strike.He said that if labor trouble spreads, We may have to take suchextreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing tooverhaul the economy through greater attention to free-marketmechanisms.He did not elaborate.Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were ended by forcebefore Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.Tass today said that the Kuznetsk strike had reached a turningpoint, with nine out of 11 mining centers back at work.It was not known how many more employees were back on the jobtoday. On Wednesday, Tass said that 24,000 strikers in Kuznetsk wereback at work and 150,000 remained on strike.State television said Wednesday that the strike in the Donetskbasin had spread to 70 of its 120 mines, more than triple theprevious number, and that mine construction workers had joined.In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, television saidsteel and coke-chemical plants were on the verge of a stoppagefor lack of coal.Earlier reports in the official press had said operations atsteel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal andcoke.Gorbachev told the national legislature Wednesday that thestrikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal.The government has agreed to most miner demands, including thoseon pensions and overtime, Gorbachev said. But he said that settlingsome longer-term issues would take up to a month.Tass outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay tonight shifts and for men using jackhammers.Strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages ofconsumer goods and food, and the government has made general pledgesof improvements in those areas.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today thatthousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urgingrailway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrestthreatens his economic reforms.Strikes have shut down more than 200 mines and factories in thecountry's two top coal-producing regions, official reports said. Ina report to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev said they have resulted ina 1 million-ton drop in coal production.Following Gorbachev to the podium, legislator Anatoly Saunin saideach lost work day cost millions of rubles that might otherwise helpimprove living conditions. You mustn't hold a knife to thethroat of the government, he told strikers.Saunin, from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine, the country's topcoal region, said the number of striking mines there increased from20 on Tuesday to 58 today.Now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join thestrike as of Aug. 1, Gorbachev said during the parliamentarysession, which was broadcast on television and radio.Such a development of events poses a threat to theimplementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika, hesaid, referring to his efforts to restructure the economy.Miners began walking out July 11 in Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin coalregion. Workers in other industries in the region soon followed. OnSaturday, miners in the Donetsk coal basin began walking off the job.The miners are demanding more local control over their industryas well as higher wages and better living conditions.Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegramto miners in the Ukraine assuring them that any concessions grantedto Siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well.He blamed some of the miners' discontent on anti-socialistelements but said he understood their basic demands.Government negotiations with strike committees have resolved mostof the miners' demands, including those on pensions and overtime,but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle,and the miners are refusing any delay, he said.Central authorities have so far balked at granting miners morecontrol over their industry.If the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy, We mayhave to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've beendoing, Gorbachev said, without specifying what steps he would take.He said the lost coal production could not be recovered byincreasing the mines' output because they already work at fullcapacity.Recent reports have put the total number of strikers in theDonetsk and Kuznetsk regions at more than 112,000, but the numberappeared to be rising.Because of disrupted coal deliveries, the strike threatened acatastrophe at metallurgical and electrical power plants, Tasssaid.The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member ofthe ruling Communist Party body who worked several years in thetractor-building industry and has spoken about labor discipline.He held marathon meetings with strikers Monday night and Tuesdayand addressed 30,000 people in the main square of Prokopyevsk, 2,100miles east of Moscow.Miners in the Donetsk Basin are demanding a 40 percent wageincrease for night work, improved living conditions, a fixed day offand retirement after 20 years of underground work.They also demand that the Coal Mining Ministry trim itsmanagerial staff.Tass carried a report Tuesday denying that the Soviet Union'sthird major coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, also was on strike.A proposed law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts isbeing rushed through the Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass said.A spokesman for the strike committee in Prokopyevsk, ValeryLegachev, said Tuesday that Slyunkov promised to increase thearea's regular food supplies by 20 to 30 percent, as well as soapand washing powder.Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported Tuesday thatSlyunkov promised higher pay for night work, longer vacations and adoubling of the wholesale price of coal to pay for the benefits.The strikes are believed to be the nation's worst since the1920s, when the country was gripped in revolution, civil war and apower struggle. Records from that period are sketchy, but fightingwas widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted.Until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the official media did notreport job actions in the Soviet Union. Underground reportsdescribed strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread asthose in Kuznetsk and Donetsk.Most of the country's 1.2 million coal miners are still working, but outputin some key regions has been halved, saddling Gorbachev with a substantiallabor and fuel problem even as he struggles to revive the Soviet economy.;The strike is the new union's first major test of strength. It began March 1as a warning action in the Karaganda coal field of Kazakhstan and theKrasnoarmeisk area of the Ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country'smajor coal regions.; The strikers are seeking wage increases of at least100 percent, better working conditions and earlier retirement. They claim thegovernment has not kept promises it made to raise miners' living standards assettlement of a nationwide coal strike in July 1989.; The 1989 strike,which involved more than 500,000 miners, made only economic demands. Thistime, Shushpanov said, the miners also want three major politicalconcessions.; First, he said, they want ""real sovereignty"" for the 15Soviet republics. They are unhappy with Gorbachev's proposed Union Treaty,which would leave the central government in control of the economy, defense,foreign policy and communications, he said.; Second, the union is demandingmore power for Gorbachev's Federation Council, which includes the presidentsof all the republics.; Finally, the union wants a ""law on property"" thatwould define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership ofland and industry, including some mines, he said.; According to the statenews agency Tass, the strike has spread to the Donetsk coal basin of theUkraine, the Vorkuta and Inta regions of northern Russia, and the Kuznetskcoal basin of western Siberia.WORKERS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterdayas coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country'spits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies.The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unionsrepresenting some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wageincrease, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wagesby 20 per cent. Further increases could only come if the government easedprohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wagedemands by other groups.Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as aclear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scatteredstoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises thatcash strapped managements can ill afford.In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coalmining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as thegovernment moved to control the budget deficit. The industry is experiencinga coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output.This has led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and ledto the present bout of unrest. Polish mines produced 69.7m tonnes of coal inthe first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period lastyear. Meanwhile KGHM produced 197,000 tonnes of refined copper in the sameperiod or 3.9 per cent more than in the first half of 1991.Coal miners in Siberia ended theirstrike today after exacting promises of better food, housing andworking conditions, but the wave of unrest they launched continuedin other key coal regions.Some of the 150,000 miners who went on strike last week inSiberia's Kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work Thursday, andthe rest went back today, strike leaders and the official Tass newsagency said.Despite announcements that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'ssweeping concessions  including granting miners greater controlover their industry  apply nationwide, hundreds of thousands ofminers stayed off the job elsewhere.In the largest coal region, the Donetsk Coal Basin of theUkraine, more than 300,000 miners were on strike, the deputyminister of the coal industry, Alexander P. Fisun, told Izvestia.In the Karaganda region of the southern republic of Kazakhstan,the Soviet Union's third-biggest coal-producing area, all 26 mineswere at a standstill, and miners made more than 70 demands,Izvestia said.Strikes were also reported in the Pechora Coal Basin in theRussian republic, and Chervonograd in the western Ukraine, officialmedia said.The labor unrest is the Soviet Union's worst in six decades.Gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placedmuch of the blame for the miners' deteriorating working and livingconditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions.Still, he and other Communist leaders have warned that if thestrikes don't end quickly, coal shortages will shut down much ofthe country's industry.On Wednesday, the Kuznetsk strike committee and members of ahigh-level government commission signed an agreement meeting manydemands.The workers were promised higher wages, increased deliveries ofmeat, sugar, soap, clothes, furniture and other consumer goods,more housing construction and  most important  a greater voice inrunning their industry.It's a victory over the system that we've had in the SovietUnion for the last 70 years, a system in which we work hard but getlittle in return, said Pyotr A. Menayev, an engineer at theTaldinski Severny open pit mine on the outskirts of Prokopyevsk.Strike committee member Vyacheslav G. Akulov stressed that theminers had agreed to interrupt the strike, not to end it.He said the miners would hold the government to its word: Ifthe government doesn't keep its promises, we will go back onstrike.The 26-member strike committee met today with a half-dozenrepresentatives to the national parliament and called for municipalelections to be advanced from the spring to the first half ofNovember.The last local elections in Kuznetsk were held two years ago,before Gorbachev's reforms made elections more democratic byoffering multiple candidates.The strike wave began 11 days ago in Kuznetsk, the country'ssecond-largest coal field.Tass said late Thursday that strikes had ended at six mines inthe Donetsk region but that most mines in the area remained onstrike.Miners at three shafts in Chervonograd, near the Polish border,joined the walkout Thursday night, said Anatoly M. Dotsenko, aspokesman for the Ukrainian Helsinki Watch Group.The coal industry employs more than 1 million workers.Tass today quoted Coal Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov as sayingthe government agreed to make all Soviet coal operationseconomically and legally independent.He said authorities had agreed to additional payments for nightand evening shifts and to give workers Sundays off.Beginning Aug. 1, mines and other industries in the coalmining complex will gain the right to sell for negotiated pricesin the USSR and abroad products which they make over and above thestate plan, Tass quoted the agreement as stipulating.It said local managers will be able to raise coal prices toreflect actual production costs.Gorbachev is trying to end the longtime Soviet practice ofsetting prices for goods that bear no relation to their free-marketvalue and encourage and end to central control of the economy.Akulov said that beginning Jan. 1, the Kuznetzk coal basin willbecome economically autonomous.The Coal Mining Ministry will continue to run the mines, butthe miners will have a much greater say setting production levelsand allocating the profits, he said.Our politics have gotten freer under perestroika, Akulovsaid of Gorbachev's economic reform program. But our livingconditions have not improved.Until Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, strikes were nottolerated.Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta regionare expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments,the Soviet news media reported Friday.The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises ofimproved living and job conditions.Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuelrationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament thatwould increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and upgradebenefits for coal miners, the official Tass news agency reported.The Komsomolskaya Pravda youth newspaper, in an article giving asympathetic view of the workers condition's in the Arctic Cirlecoal-mining districts, said many miners do not see daylight formonths because of their underground work and the sun dips below thehorizon in the winter.A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that the latest round ofstrikes is illegal but did not impose any penalties. The miners'sunions said the decision will be appealed.Coal miners in the northern region and the Ukraine struck fortwo weeks this summer but returned to work in July after parliamentpassed a resolution promising reforms, including improved socialand economic conditions. The miners say the government has renedgedon its promises.The news media gave these accounts of the latest strikes:Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largestmine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighthday, according to Tass.Komsomolskaya Pravda said night-shift workers walked out atthree mines in Vorkuta and at another one the miners were stillworking but were preventing the coal from being shipped outside theregion.In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the nation's majorcoal-producing area, miner representatives were discussing anotherstrike. Tens of thousands of miners walked off the job for twohours Wednesday.Tass said that in Donetsk the miners gathered in front of theHouse of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline forimplementing reforms.COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reformrampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike,pressing the government for higher wages.But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in. It hasinstead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered itssecond week, declared illegal.The miners' position seems untenable. Romanians appear solidly opposed tothe strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of theequivalent of Dollars 290 a month. Most workers earn less than Dollars 80.Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignoredappeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced eachyear in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy. Theregion's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, whichtogether account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity,could also be run using lignite and gas.The ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing theircoal out of the market. According to the ministry, if the miners' paydemands were met, the cost of their coal would double. Even at presentprices, Ukrainian coal is being imported to the Romanian market.The strike seems motivated by a number of factors. The rank and file havecome out because they want more money to compensate for the difficultconditions in which they live and work.They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr MironCosma, the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured theirearlier wage increases.Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he hasthe support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.The ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations intocharges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH companyofficials. The company's chief accountant and budget director have alreadybeen fired, following earlier investigations.Ministry of Industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt todivert attention from the investigations.Mr Cosma, however, appears confident. One of his bargaining tools is thethreat, albeit veiled, of fresh violence.In response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men, whoappear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: 'Withminers, anything is possible.'But he is also making political threats. In recent months, Mr Cosma hasclaimed he has evidence that senior government officials, includingPresident Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans toconsolidate their own power.Mr Cosma appears increasingly willing to talk if his demands are not met. Itremains to be seen whether those involved in the incidents of 1990 and 1991now feel confident enough to ignore him.Port workers in Szczecin andsouthwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes withminers demanding the l","AP880816-0135,AP890616-0230,FBIS4-42027,WSJ870804-0095,AP890720-0075,AP890719-0248,SJMN91-06069108,FT923-12122,AP890721-0091,AP891103-0200,FT933-9536,AP880817-0124",Coal miners strike in major coal regions around the world.,"Major strikes, mostly by coal miners seeking higher wages, seriously disrupted industries throughout the world from 1987 to 1994 in South Africa, Poland, Romania, the Ukraine, Siberia and Central Asia in the Soviet Union.

When I opened my eyes andlooked around, there was just a pile of rubble where the apartmentsused to be.Culpepper's head and arms were cut in the collapse.Manager Bob Husman of a Golbro jewelry store ordered employeesinto the vault shortly before the roof and walls crashed down onhim, 20 feet from the vault.In the jewelry business, the vault is the safest place, hesaid. I had structural steel on me but managed to crawl out. Itwas the worst kind of nightmare.The employees in the vault were dug out an hour after thecollapse, shaken but not hurt.Rick Snider was in the bakery aisle of a supermarket.Part of the roof was coming off, he said. Some ladies werecrying, but it was quite calm. A checkout lady was hit with a cashregister. People were shouting, `Can I help?' and they were leadingpeople to the light. There was no screaming or hysterical stuff. Icame out and I couldn't believe the damage.For Ed Rolan, a medic, the devastation brought back memories ofVietnam. Rolan, who was driving home when the tornado hit, wentright to work helping the stricken motorists around him.One lady was thrown from her car and I thought she was dead,he said. I came back by her later and saw she had changedpositions. It took 30 minutes to get a stretcher to her.The enormity of the death and destruction sank in veryquickly, Rolan said. This is the closest to death I have beensince Vietnam.Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice PresidentDan Quayle, praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northernAlabama city's residents during a visit Saturday.Mrs. Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debrisleft by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured atCrestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour.The tornado left 18 people dead, hundreds injured and up to1,000 homeless. The youngest victim, a 2{-year-old girl, diedFriday after being taken off life-support systems.The community is filled with heroes  people who without ...regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so thatthey could survive, said Mrs. Quayle, who was accompanied by Gov.Guy Hunt and U.S. Sens. Howell Heflin and Richard Shelby.Mrs. Quayle, who made similar visits to San Francisco after theOct. 17 earthquake and Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Hugo, alsopraised corporations that have made donations to help Huntsvillerecover.Federal and state officials have promised to do whatever isnecessary to help Huntsville, even if disaster relief funds aresqueezed by Hurricane Hugo and the quake.We're here to get the job done, Grant Peterson, associatedirector of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Friday.Whatever's needed will be done.President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area, but FEMA mayhave to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash ofnatural disasters. Parts of eight states have been declaredeligible for federal relief.Any one disaster like Hugo or the earthquake in Californiaexceeds ... what we have in a normal year alone, Peterson said.Congress provided $1.1 billion in supplemental funds to FEMAafter Hugo devastated the Caribbean and the East Coast inSeptember, and $1.2 billion following the earthquake that ravagedparts of northern California on Oct. 17.So far, about $1.3 billion has been allocated to disastervictims. Peterson said he's not yet concerned about FEMA meetingits financial obligations.I would say that to ask for any more money at this point wouldbe premature, he said.Peterson and his aides urged patience during the arduous task ofprocessing thousands of relief requests from the Huntsville area.If everything works well, in seven to 10 days we should getthe first checks out, Peterson said Friday. I'll make sure thatwe expedite these requests to meet the people's needs.The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost ofproviding clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims, withthe federal government pitching in the other 75 percent. Gov. Huntsaid he expected the Alabama Legislature to come up with whatevermoney is needed.The state doesn't budget for disasters, said Danny Cooper,Alabama's emergency management director. We take care of them atthe time.Hunt stressed that government agencies won't be able to shoulderthe entire load. He requested donations to agencies such as theAmerican Red Cross, which set up a shelter for the homeless asrescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hoursafter the tornado struck.The tornado hit Huntsville with devastating force  winds wereestimated at 250 mph  and virtually no warning about 4:30 p.m.Wednesday, leaving a 10-mile-long path of destruction.A shopping center and clusters of apartment buildings wereleveled. Cars were piled atop each other like the remnants of ademolition derby.Cooper said 119 homes were destroyed and 125 had lesser damage.Three churches, two schools, 35 businesses and 10 public buildingswere either destroyed or suffered heavy damage.Neighbors pitched in to help Debra McKay and her family pickthrough the rubble of their home. The only things standing were thewalls around two bathrooms and an adjacent hallway  the area whereMs. McKay and her three children rode out the storm.I know the Lord spared us, she said. I woke up a differentperson this morning.Officials said several truckloads of food have rolled intoHuntsville but the city is running out of places to store the goods.There's a sense of thankfulness, Hunt said. It'sheartwarming to see how people have come together.Huntsville is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, theArmy's Redstone Arsenal and a number of high-tech industries. MayorSteve Hettinger said the city would be able to withstand thetornado's financial impact.Huntsville has a strong economy, a diverse economy, he said.That's not the source of our concern.A powerful storm system brought","AP891117-0002,AP891115-0199,AP891116-0035,AP891116-0191,AP891116-0198,AP891116-0115,AP891116-0133,LA111689-0160,AP891118-0136,AP891116-0184",Storm causes death and injuries from Midwest throughout East coast.,"A powerful storm swept across the Midwest and into the Eastern states leaving 27 dead, hundreds injured, and thousands homeless.

34,d084a,"The damaged battleship USS Iowa steamed homefrom Puerto Rico on Friday while investigators on board interviewedcrewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion thatkilled 47 sailors.Ens. Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said the Navywould not release the exact position of the ship, which wasexpected to reach its home port here about 5:30 p.m. Sunday.The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions thatcrewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by theexplosion and fire while sailors working several levels belowsuffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces.Navy investigators also said the explosion left two fully loadedgun barrels in the turret, the newspaper reported.The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loadedand just after the crew had been given permission to load and firethe center gun, the newspaper said.After the fire was extinguished, crew men worked quickly toremove the shells and powder from the other two guns before theycould explode, the newspaper said.Meanwhile, NBC News reported that the exact cause of the blastin one of the ship's three 16-inch gun turrets on Wednesday maynever be known because the destruction inside the turret was socomplete.The Navy released photographs of the firefighting effort, whichauthorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cooloff the turret before anyone could enter it.During the trip home, investigators on board were reviewing avideotape of the turret taken by an Iowa officer who had wanted torecord the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred, saidLt. Cmdr. James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman. He said theinvestigators had not decided whether to release the tape to thepublic. Investigators were also interviewing crew members.Maj. Tom Johnston, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet inNorfolk, said he had no information on the cause of death of the 47crewmen.Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause ofthe explosion.In Norfolk, memorial services for the 47 victims are tentativelyset for 9 a.m. Monday. President George Bush is to attend.Johnson said the ship is steaming under its own power, andrepeated the Navy's daily report that the ship is seaworthy and inno danger.The 887-foot, 58,000-ton battleship has armor up to 17{ inchesthick. Navy officials have said that the explosion in the No. 2 gunturret damaged only the turret.The top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee saidFriday the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion.The explosion occurred during open seas gun practice 300 milesnorth of Puerto Rico. The Pentagon said the blast ripped throughthe middle gun of the three-gun turret, and that that gun had notbeen fired prior to the explosion.The Pentagon has ordered that no 16-inch gun will be fired untilthe investigation is complete. Ships with those guns  thebattleships Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri and Wisconsin  were builtduring World War II. Some critics have said the 16-inch guns areoutmoded and dangerous.The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gunexplosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday asthe Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret toblow up.None of the guns in the no. 2 turret had been fired before theexplosion instantly killed the seamen, Navy officials said. Theydiscarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by red-hotdebris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds.The Navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium onfiring 16-inch guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sisterbattleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk, Va., whilethe bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at DoverAir Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1,600crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead.At the White House, chief of staff John Sununu announcedPresident Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for thevictims in Norfolk. He said the president had heard of the serviceand told his staff if it could be fitted in, he wanted to bethere ... wants to be a part.The blast occurred Wednesday morning northeast of Puerto Rico asthe Iowa took part in firing exercises that were part of navaltraining.A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet and the ship's former captainboth said the explosion in the No. 2 turret could have beentriggered by red-hot debris from earlier firings in the three-gunturret.But Cmdr. Mark Baker, chief of the Navy's Pentagon press office,said later that none of the turret's three guns had been fired.Only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of atraining exercise had been fired, he said, and all had been fromthe No. 1 turret, forward of the one that exploded.No eyewitnesses survived Wednesday's explosion behind one of the16-inch guns on the Iowa, one of the largest warships ever.Pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about theexact cause of the disaster, the worst to strike a Navy ship since1977, but two officers  Capt. Paul Hanley, a fleet spokesman, andCapt. Larry Seaquist, the ship's former captain  said a possibleexplanation was that red-hot debris from a previous round ignitednew charges.But Seaquist stressed, We simply do not know what caused thatpowder to go.Baker said no guns in the No. 2 turret had been fired and theorder had just been given to the No. 2 turret crew to load andprepare the center gun when the explosion occurred.We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he headed back toWashington from a NATO meeting in Brussels.The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico tounload the bodies, which were then flown to Delaware. Navyinvestigators boarded the ship as it left for Norfolk, where it isexpected to arrive Sunday or Monday.Navy Secretary William Ball attended a memorial service at theDelaware base, home of the armed services' largest mortuary. Theflag-draped coffins were carried off a plane by Navy honor guards.Around the United States, Navy officers and chaplains broke thebad news to the dead men's next of kin.The job began just before midnight Wednesday, when officials inNorfolk received the list of the dead.I've done it many times and I'll never get used to it, saidCmdr. Doug Palmer, acting chaplain for the Norfolk Navy Base. Fivemen had families in the Norfolk area.The commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet, Adm. Jerome Johnson, whowas on board the Iowa, told reporters in Puerto Rico, The fireand explosion was instantaneous.Cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gunhouse at the top of the turret, rather than the mechanicalcompartments and ammunition magazines below it.Eleven men escaped from powder magazines deep within the ship atthe base of the turret. A dozen crew members suffered minorinjuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion. They weretreated and returned to duty, said Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman.At the White House, President Bush brushed aside suggestionsthat the explosion was due to the age of the Iowa, a World War IIleviathan brought out of mothballs during the military buildup ofthe Reagan administration.Asked about the ship's safety, Bush said he wanted to insurethat procedures were checked to be sure that safety is at thehighest point ... but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion thatbecause that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that waythat makes a useful platform obsolete.Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey,began the board of inquiry's investigation. Hoffman said he couldnot predict when the investigation would be completed.Seaquist told reporters, It seems from the reports that thosepowders exploded. He referred to the six 110-pound sacks ofpowder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-poundshell.Seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris fromthe breech at a gun's rear must be operated manually. Each gun hasa one-inch diameter tube carrying air under 3,000 pounds ofpressure to blow debris from the 62-foot barrel.The only officer killed was Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch fromLas Cruces, N.M., who would normally be in a small compartment atthe rear of the swivelling top of the turret, adjacent to the roomin which shells are loaded.Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion canoccur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that cooksoff  ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel orsmoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round.The first thing that comes to mind is something like acook-off, said Hanley. It could have been a bag or aprojectile. We just don't know yet.None of the four battleships of the Iowa class, which sawservice in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, has eversustained such an explosion, Pentagon officials said.Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for theNavy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died whena launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton wasstruck by a Spanish freighter.Except for two World War II Japanese battleships and the currentNavy aircraft carriers, the 58,000-ton ships of the Iowa class arethe largest warships in the world.Investigators aboard the USS Iowa searched forclues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of47 sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and grief-strickenfamilies dealt with the loss of their loved ones.Officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worstdisaster to strike a Navy ship in more than a decade, a blast thatripped through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret during naval exercisesWednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico.Although naval gunnery experts combed the vessel Thursday, theirtask was complicated by the absence of survivors from the swivelinggun housing where the explosion occurred. Eleven men escaped frompowder magazines located deep within the ship at the base of theturret.We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he returned to Washingtonfrom a NATO meeting in Brussels.The Navy imposed a moratorium on firing 16-inch guns found onthe Iowa and its three sister battleships, the New Jersey, theWisconsin and the Missouri, pending an investigation of thedisaster.Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey,began the board of inquiry's investigation, and Pentagon spokesmanFred Hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation wouldbe completed.As the Iowa headed toward its home port in Norfolk, Va., theflag-draped, metal coffins containing the bodies of the 47 seamenkilled arrived at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, site of thelargest military mortuary. Navy honor guards carried the coffinsoff a camouflaged C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.The bodies had been airlifted by helicopter from the Iowa whileit was anchored offshore from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station inPuerto Rico, and placed on the cargo plane for the flight home.Across the nation, teams of Navy officers and chaplains brokethe news to the sailors' next of kin.It's the greatest tragedy any of us can suffer, said RearAdm. Jimmy Pappas, the base commander in Norfolk. It's the mostdifficult thing you have to do to tell someone that a loved onehas been killed.Ernest Hanyecz Sr., of Bordentown, N.J., stayed up all nighttrying to get information about his 27-year-old son Ernest beforelearning Thursday that he was among those killed.As long as they play their war games, there will be moredeaths and innocent people will die, said Hanyecz, whose sonjoined the Navy at the age of 17.The dead included one officer, Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch, 24,of Las Cruces, N.M., and 46 enlisted men. Most victims were singleand from 18 to 22 years old, said Navy officials. A memorialservice will be held Monday on the Norfolk base.Adm. Jerome Johnson, the commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet who wasaboard the Iowa, said the fire and explosion was instantaneous.Navy officials aboard the Iowa had scheduled firing 22 rounds.Four rounds were fired from the No. 1 turret and immediately afterthe commander had given the order to load and prepare the gun inthe No. 2 turret, the explosion occurred.Capt. Larry Seaquist, a former captain of the Iowa, toldreporters earlier in the day, It seems from the reports thatthose powders exploded. Six 110-pound sacks of powder are rammedinto each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-pound shell.Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion canoccur if a gun breech is cracked, but Seaquist stressed, wesimply do not know what caused that powder to go.None of the four battleships of the Iowa class, which sawservice in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, hadpreviously experienced such an explosion, Pentagon officials said.Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for theNavy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died whena launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton wasstruck by a Spanish freighter.Except for two World War II Japanese battleships and the currentNavy aircraft carriers, the 58,000-ton ships of the Iowa class arethe largest warships in the world.Hundreds of people gathered to honor the 47sailors who died on the USS Iowa as victims of a tragedy thatreaches into little towns all over the country.Words are never sufficient at a time like this to express thefeelings that we share, Norfolk Mayor Joseph Leafe told the morethan 750 people who came to Friday's memorial at the ElizabethRiver waterfront.The 58,000-ton battleship was steaming toward its home port hereand was to arrive Sunday. Meanwhile, Navy investigators on boardstudied an amateur videotape for clues into Wednesday's explosionin the ship's No. 2 gun turret.Lt. Cmdr. James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman, said the explosionoccurred as an Iowa officer was making a videotape to record thefiring of the ship's big guns. Cudler said Navy officials had notdecided whether to release the tape publicly.Crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed bythe explosion and fire while sailors working several levels belowsuffocated when the blast sucked out all the oxygen, according to areport in today's editions of The Washington Post.Maj.

The Pentagon hasordered the 16-inch guns on all four World War II-era battleshipssilenced until the investigation is finished.Some critics have said the 16-inch guns are outmoded anddangerous.Jim Smith, 63, of Norfolk, said he attended the memorial becausehe considered the dead men his shipmates.I served aboard the battleship North Carolina in 1946. I knowabout those big guns .... I know these things can happen, hesaid. At times like this, everyone seems to pull together. Webecome one family.Joan Taplett, wife of a Navy commander, said she brought her3-year-old son so he would always remember the men who died.I'm from South Dakota. ... When I heard that one of the menkilled was from there, I had to come, she said. I guess I'mhere for his parents. Something like this touches all of us ... Itreaches into little towns all over the country, she said.David L. Hanson, a 23-year-old electrician's mate 3rd class fromBison, S.D., population 457, was among those killed.A wreath of 47 yellow carnations was cast into the river, aNorfolk police honor guard gave a 21-gun salute and a Navy buglerplayed taps at the 15-minute ceremony.On the USS Iowa, 47 young men died too soon ... We willremember, and honor and grieve as a nation, Gov. Gerald L.Baliles said.The Navy is planning a ceremony for the crew and family membersMonday morning at Norfolk Naval Base, with President Bush scheduledto attend.Thousands of grieving friends and relativesof the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS Iowa gatheredquietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved ones asbrothers in eternity.We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and infact, for the 11 who survived, the president told a packedmemorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station. They all were, inthe words of a poet, `the men behind the guns.'They came from Hidalgo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Tampa,Florida; Costa Mesa, California. They came to the Navy asstrangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends, and left theNavy as brothers in eternity. In the finest Navy tradition, theyserved proudly on a great battleship, the USS Iowa.The president, a World War II Navy pilot, said he was proud torecommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battlestars in two wars.But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesdayin the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, he said, Fate has written asorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship.The Iowa's commander, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, said the turret'screw was the best gun crew on the ship, and called its chief Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson, N.Y. my No. 1 chief.Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dressblues were among the 6,000 people crowded into a hangar for theservice. A bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium;behind were an American flag and the battleship's banners. Outside,another 2,000 people listened to the service on loudspeakers.As many as 500 Iowa crewmen were unable to attend the servicebecause they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted toenter the hangar because of security measures to protect Bush.Many were angry they could not attend, said Machinist's MateDavid Finn, 38. It was very important to them, Finn said.The service came a day after the World War II-era battleshipeased into its home port, its gun barrels scorched and its 1,500crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memoryof their dead shipmates.Moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the menof turret No. 2.I remember their faces as they toiled at their guns, sweatingan honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a greatcause, he said.I remember as they talked among themselves, looking so muchlike sailors of the past, sharing the exuberance of the times andthe dreams of the future, he said.They were the life, the spirit and the soul of our ship. ...They made the ultimate sacrifice for us. ... The men of Turret Twowill be part of the spirit of the Iowa forever.Bush recounted seeing the Iowa off the coast of the Philippinesas a naval aviator in World War II, and the great sense ofconfidence the big ship lent to the fleet.Addressing the children of the victims, he said: You mustnever forget that your father was America's pride.At the end of the service, while the Navy Hymn was played,President and Mrs. Bush greeted and consoled the families of thelost men. After the 45-minute service, the families attended aprivate reception with Moosally.The Navy said 45 victims' families attended the service.At a press briefing following the reception, Moosally praisedthe hundreds of men who fought the fire for their courage.God gave birth to 500 heroes, the captain said. Fire on aship is the most terrifying fear ... you have nowhere to run.Our extensive training paid off, he said. Besides thefirefighting crews, we had cooks, engineers, deck seamen, Marinesall fighting to save the ship.Moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to ViceAdm. Jerome Johnson, commander of the 2nd Fleet, to tell him towatch the No. 2 turret because it contained his best crew.This was my best turret, Moosally said. He said turret chiefZiegler was the most meticulous of men. He was my No. 1 chief ofthe 84 chiefs aboard.Nobody in that turret did anything unless they werequalified, Moosally said.Moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters'questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired,saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary.All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly lastWednesday when the explosion ripped through it. At the time, theIowa was conducting open seas gun exercises off Puerto Rico.The Navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing.Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of theexplosion.Cmdr. John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapons officer, said the gunswere thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and Moosallysaid he had no hesitation about the guns' safety.I'll be in the turret for the first shot to go off, thecaptain said.One of the survivors, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt,21, of Tampa, Fla., said that at first the men down in the powdermagazine in the lowest level of the turret didn't know anything waswrong.We were waiting for the gun to fire, and we weren't sure, hesaid. When the men discovered that no one was answering theinterior turret communications link, Truitt ordered the powderreturned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated.The sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed throughhatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck,Truitt recalled.My first thought was that I'd better get to a lifeboatstation, because if the fire got to the magazine things would bebad, he said.Navy investigators will be looking at allpossibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort todetermine what caused the explosion that killed 47 aboard thebattleship USS Iowa, officials say.It could take months before the probe is completed and theresults released publicly, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Alan Dooleysaid Sunday.A seven-member team of investigators boarded the battleship aday after the explosion flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turreton Wednesday.They're looking at any evidence of human error or mechanicalerror, or anything technical, said Lt. Janet Mescus, aspokeswoman at the Navy's information center at Norfolk, Va., theship's home port. The Iowa returned to Norfolk on Sunday.They're moving as quickly as they can, Lt. Mescus said, butadded, They want to be thorough and that takes time.Dooley said the investigation would be fairly complexbecause there were no witnesses. There were 11 survivors inside theturret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship'smagazines, the Navy said.Dooley said no information would be released until the probe iscompleted, and the Navy has refused to speculate on the cause ofthe explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.But The New York Times reported Sunday that Navy teams whoentered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile thatthe gun was to have fired still there.The Times cited unidentified sources as saying this indicatedthe explosion occurred while the bags containing 550 pounds ofpropellant powder were still being loaded into the gun.Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when thebags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, thenewspaper said. They said flame and hot gases from the blast wentdown the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to theguns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.The Navy on Sunday released an amateur videotape of theexplosion, which was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowawho wanted to record the firing of the guns.The investigation team is headed by Rear Adm. Richard D.Milligan, former commanding officer of the battleship USS NewJersey, and it also includes experts on gunnery and weapons.The 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa, which can loba shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles, have an outdateddesign that is unfit in the nuclear missile age, critics say.They're old-fashioned and inherently dangerous. They all oughtto be eliminated, retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Centerfor Defense Information said Thursday. I don't know what more ittakes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is nolonger appropriate on warships.But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use onany ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboardthe battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for targetpractice.This gun ... remains the finest naval gun in the world. It wasthe pinnacle of gun design art, and it is still a front-linesystem, said Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander of the Iowa untillast May.The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packedin silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-longbarrel. It works like the breech-loaded guns that roared during theCivil War: A shell is placed into a barrel and then charged withgunpowder in a separate package.In the Iowa's case, 660 pounds of powder  six 110-pound bags is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2,700 pounds at aspeed of 2,500 feet per second. An electric spark ignites thepowder.The extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during theburst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases canbuild up in the barrel. Air pressurized to 3,000 pounds per squareinch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guardagainst a blowback, which happens when powder ignites beforethe breech is closed.In newer guns, powder is packed in metal containers. Missiles,the backbone of the modern Navy's attack capability, haveintegrated propellants.Capt. James Bush of the Center for Defense Information, aprivate think tank often critical of Pentagon policy, said the Iowaexplosion could have been caused by smoldering debris, a blowbackor a mishap in the handling of powder.It wasn't unexpected. It wasn't a surprise. This is dangeroustechnology. It's archaic, Bush said. These are the only guns inthe Navy that still used bagged powder.The Navy said Thursday that none of the guns in the Iowa turrethad been fired before the explosion took place.The Navy also on Thursday placed a moratorium on firing the bigguns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, theNew Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.In a larger sense, critics say the battleships themselves, oncethe mainstay of gunboat diplomacy, have outlived their purpose.Despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, the battlewagons arevulnerable to submarine and missile attack. The 20-mile range ofthe 16-inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can befired at much greater distances.We can do almost anything with a missile and do it better,Bush said.Battleships reached their heyday in World War I and wereintended to fight other ships.The Iowa, first launched in 1942, was the first of an entireclass of U.S. battlewagons built to conquer Japan.It supported Marine amphibious landings and shelled shoretargets, but the aircraft carrier emerged as the Navy's top weaponbecause naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing eachother. The Iowa also fought off Korea.The Iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballsin the Reagan administration's military buildup six years ago. Theywere upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 20mm guns and Harpoonmissiles.One of the battleships, the New Jersey, bombarded Syrian andDruze positions in Lebanon as part the U.S. peacekeeping role in1983. But the 16-inch guns often missed their targets, which theNavy blamed on unreliable powder from World War II.There was no military need to return these ships to activeduty, said the CDI's LaRocque. Their only military utility isto bombard Third World countries, and the era of gunboat diplomacyis over.The scarred battleship USS Iowa made asomber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 familymembers and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped anexplosion that killed 47 sailors.Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as thehuge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m.,just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated. Twentyminutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchangingtearful embraces with the returning sailors.They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to gethome, said Capt. Steven Karalekas.The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gunturret, which extends six decks down into the ship. There were 11survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powderfrom the ship's magazines, the Navy said.Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of thefire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with fullcrews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.The No. 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosionoccurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated. Thecenter gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed.When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scatteredcheers by those on the dock, but all remained silent as the shippulled into the pier. The somber mood was heightened by the lack ofbands, and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked.Adm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet,was on the dock to greet the vessel. As it docked, three Marinesraised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families,and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or thecrewmen.The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in anamateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday. The tape was madeby an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record thefiring of the big guns.The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-likerubber bloomers that seal the turret's gun slits, is followedby a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base ofthe gunhouse.The videotape cut immediately to damage control firefightersspraying heavy streams of water onto the turret.Throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sundaymorning to the families of Iowa crewmen.We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way, said Cmdr.John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk NavalAir Station. Our faith helps us to handle what science cannotanswer, the mystery of death.A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a bookcontaining the names of the dead were taken to the altar.Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lostSoviet submarine put political differences aside and unite thehuman family as one.On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial servicein a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officialssaid they did not know how many would attend. None of the victimslisted the Norfolk area as their hometown.The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico. ThePentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of thethree-gun turret had been fired.

35,d085d,"Here is a chronology of Hurricane Hugo's destructive path acrossthe Caribbean into South Carolina:Residents took forecasters at their wordwhen they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number ofdeaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthyrespect, authorities said.The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives inSouth Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, whichbore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.We just feel very thankful about that, said Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousands of people who were in the sheltersand the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland werepotential victims of injury and death.Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring thehurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuationwarnings.The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away,and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've had so many close calls, said Gary Garnet, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service.But this storm was very, very strong, he said. This timethey realized it.Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headedfor shelters.Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed upInterstate 26 toward Columbia.Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding thewarnings.It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse, he said.You've just got to say nice things about the people.Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-wearyCharlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no otherstorms brewing.There's nothing to worry about out there, he said.This historic city has survived theravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all inHurricane Hugo.The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into CharlestonThursday night.This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which fewpeople who have lived all their lives in Charleston haveexperienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston sinceHurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, bothnatural and man-made.The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado torethrough the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causingan estimated $2 million in property damage.Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures liningquaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861.The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and anynumber of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestoniansof refinement as September gales.But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on thehot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what somefolks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, theearthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildingsand tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets.In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitorsannually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby finesand beaches.Charleston has received international acclaim as home to SpoletoFestival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive artsfestival.Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise ofseveral hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to fleethe South Carolina coast.But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions andforecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in thosemodels, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, butforecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time forevacuation.Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good ideawhere Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in atimely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting theintensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricanejust hours before it slammed into Charleston.It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer models for that, McAdie said.We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minuteincrease in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting toolswere reports from aircraft or ships.We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say ourforecasts were less accurate, Clark said.In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites toobtain a global weather picture. Information from the satellite isused to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models thattelevision viewers see every night.Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at theNational Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes toaccount for current weather conditions and the position of thehurricane.To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyzesupercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similarstorms and the current path of the hurricane.Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the MassachussettsInstitute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.Congress and the American people are suffering from thecollective delusion that our data problems have been solved bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enoughinformation about the wind and temperatures that affect ahurricane's path.Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanescomes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have to remember that those models used are only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of theforecaster to predict the storm's path.Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents insoutheastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.This is a disaster staring us right in the eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston,where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and causedutility transformers to explode.All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we havetaken have been sufficient, Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in onthe city. I just hope and pray we can get through this without anyloss of life.By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston. The roofcracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that haswithstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into thepaneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the commandpost was knocked out.Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, andabout three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle ofPalms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of theNational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135mph.Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severeflooding as it moved up the East Coast. The storm posed a 19 percentchance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hittingBoston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resorttowns themselves. Power lines and trees were downed in some spotsand water flooded roads. Stop lights and neon lights were knockedout in Myrtle Beach.One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,' said AmyGarrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs,palmetto fronds and chunks of bark. Businesses were closed andclasses at public schools and universities canceled. Riley orderedresidents of one-story homes to evacuate.Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients wellenough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room foremergency patients, officials said.About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the stateas of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220miles northwest of here.We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in sidedoors, said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at theConway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach. We tried to postguards at the doors, but people were still coming in.American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the numberof evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., whoappealed for help.Right now the Red Cross is sheltering tens of thousands ofpeople all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course is at the sametime that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and theother Caribbean islands.We're beginning to feel the squeeze. Our resources are verytight. Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest reliefoperations of the decade.At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degreesnorth and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. Thehurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North andSouth Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next twodays, according to the hurricane center.The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said. A hurricane warningwas in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane onthe Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,which indicated it could cause extreme damage.It strengthened more than we thought it would, Sheets said,adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up theAppalachians.The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm'stidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed anormal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.On top of that will be waves, Sheets said earlier, and inmany places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept cleanoff.Amid the uproar of live coverage by themajor networks and scores of other media organizations, NationalHurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoringHurricane Hugo.The whole system looks chaotic, but it works, said BobSheets, the center's director.On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank ofmonitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulouscalculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike andgetting emergency operations going in those areas.On the other side were the media  a pack of reporters, cameraoperators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time andtidbits of his expertise.In the center was Sheets himself. Surrounded by cameras, wiresand two dozen journalists with pads and telephones, the ubiquitousred-headed meteorologist has appeared on television all week next toa large satellite monitor showing colorful images of Hurricane Hugo.During prime news time, competing technicians and cameramen shoutand make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots ofSheets.At his back, casually dressed forecasters who have been working12-hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites.We obviously don't like this and could probably do a betterjob, but everyone knows now because of the media, said hurricanespecialist Max Mayfield. In the Caribbean, we were not so certainthe word got out. But we know the Carolinas have been evacuated.When a hurricane warning goes into effect, It's a $50 millionstatement, said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring to the cost ofemergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implementedwhen the warning is posted.If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm was outthere, he said. Before the hurricane warning system wasestablished, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands oflives. But early today, after days of warnings and proper evacuationprocedures, there were no immediate reports of deaths despitewidespread damage in Charleston and other coastal areas of SouthCarolina.I like to think that we make a difference a far as human livesare concerned, Cline said.After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecasters began towind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the lastseveral days. But, he warned, the hurricane center still isfollowing three other weather systems that have moved into theAtlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm inthe Pacific.I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because peopleare getting clobbered to death, meteorologist Mark Zimmer said asthe storm pounded Charleston, S.C. But we've done all we can.Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages. AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster. When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million. It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.The greenhouse effect may breed bigger anddeadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent strongerthan Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, somemeteorologists say.Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mphwinds this past week, killing at least 41 people.Just before Hugo struck the U.S. coast, its pressure was measuredat 940 millibars. That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanesthis century to hit the United States, the National HurricaneCenter's Miles Lawrence said today.Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean lastyear, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage. It was the mostpowerful hurricane ever recorded.Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane withcurrent ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorologydepartment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, thewind speeds might be 25 percent higher  which means the destructiveforce would be more like 50 percent higher, he said.Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center forAtmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests thewarming trend is already here.Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a newbook Global Warming, said six of the 10 hottest years in thelast 100 occurred in the 1980s.He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when itswinds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the GulfStream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer, hesaid. And I think there are better-than-even odds that you willhave stronger hurricanes.Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanesof the future could grow to Gilbert's strength  and future Gilbertswill be even stronger.Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the nationalhurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensityscale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with fivethe highest.The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-casescenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jumpby 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas  which bothcontribute to the greenhouse effect  continue to pour into theatmosphere unchecked.It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up,the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler. But he said that isunlikley.That's not what the models are showing, Schneider said. Andthat's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.","AP890922-0193,AP890925-0054,AP890922-0049,AP890922-0167,LA092789-0093,AP890922-0007,AP890922-0072,WSJ890928-0084,AP890923-0035",Record damage by 1989's Hurricane Hugo in Caribbean and Carolinas,"In September 1989, Category 4 Hurricane Hugo, with 135mph winds, damaged the eastern Caribbean then hit South Carolina, where coastal residents fled inland or into shelters. 17 Carolinians were killed.

It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo.

Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph.

Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.",,,,
36,d090d,"President Corazon Aquino todayreversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to negotiatecease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who havestaged coup attempts.Mrs. Aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks,including her most outspoken critic, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile.Manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions. Although noone has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government hasblamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppledMrs. Aquino in coup attempts.The Communist rebels have been waging a 21-year rebellion toestablish a Marxist state. The last cease-fire with them collapsedin early 1987.Sen. Wigberto Tanada called for a truce between the governmentand the Communist rebels after a major earthquake in thePhilippines on July 16, but Mrs. Aquino rejected the proposal.On Tuesday, a pro-Aquino senator, Orlando Mercado, urged Mrs.Aquino to put aside differences with her political foes and beginto discuss the nation's security problems and economic woes.Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, whofired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coupattempt in November 1986.Mrs. Aquino said in a statement today that Mercado and Enrileare welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee ofCabinet members.Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos has adamantly refused anycease-fire with the Communist guerrillas since November 1986 whenthe Aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a 60-daytruce.Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, has been credited withcrushing six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.Communists have accused him of whipping up threats of anothercoup attempt against Mrs. Aquino so that the civilian leadershipwould become indebted to him. Ramos has denied all allegations.The last cease-fire with the rebels collapsed in January 1987after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside Mrs. Aquino'soffice for land reform.President Corazon Aquino said todayshe will not allow Ferdinand Marcos to come home to die and hergovernment will not permit the ousted president to be buried onPhilippine soil.Marcos' wife Imelda appealed today to Mrs. Aquino to open herheart and allow the former president to return. Marcos' lawyeralso asked the Philippine Supreme Court to order the return,pledging the ousted leader would cooperate with the Aquinoadministration.Marcos was reported in critical condition today in a Honoluluhospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery. Hospitalofficials said the 71-year-old former Philippine leader wassuffering from renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure.In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Imelda had left thehospital to make a final appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husbandto die in his homeland.Mrs. Aquino's daughter, Maria Elena Cruz, said the president hadreceived no calls from Mrs. Marcos. Mrs. Cruz serves as hermother's secretary.In a statement broadcast today by the pro-Marcos radio stationDZEC, Imelda said she was trying to contact the presidential officeto make a last appeal to Madam Corazon Aquino to open her heartand let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.This is for reconciliation, this is what's best for thecountry, Imelda said. I'd like to ask our people to pray thatMarcos may continue to live.Mrs. Aquino told reporters earlier that she was sorry to hearthat Marcos' condition had deteriorated and I pray that he willbe able to recover.I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me forreconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as Iagree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider alsothe rights and interests of millions of Filipinos, Mrs. Aquinosaid.I have already said in the past that we will not allow hisremains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans toavoid any untoward incidents, she added.Mrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986 uprising thattoppled his administration and forced him into exile in Hawaii.Today, the Manila Stock Exchange's composite index fell to1,084.53 from Thursday's close of 1,102.97. Traders said rumors ofMarcos' death triggered a selling wave shortly before noon.In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Mrs. Marcos plannedto make one last appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband toreturn home.Rafael Ileto, Mrs. Aquino's national security advisor, saidgranting such a request was still an option but, I doubt verymuch that it will be one of the solutions.Ileto, who met with Mrs. Aquino for a half-hour today, saidMarcos no longer posed a threat to the nation but his followerscan cause disruptions of normal functions.Ileto, a retired vice chief of staff and former DefenseMinister, said the 160,000-member armed forces was capable ofquelling any unrest by Marcos supporters.The resignation of the land reformsecretary raises doubts about President Corazon Aquino's commitmentto agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a governmentcriticized for lack of vision.The controversy climaxed Thursday with the resignation ofSecretary-designate Florencio Abad, 35, whose nomination wasopposed by the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party.Handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistenciesfor which Mrs. Aquino has been criticized: lack of clearpriorities; tactical blundering; and the strong influence of herrelatives over national policy.It also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all herrhetoric, Mrs. Aquino does not share the deep commitment to socialchange which they expected when she took power in the 1986 peoplepower uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos.The sincerity of Corazon Aquino is being seriouslyquestioned, wrote columnist Ninez Cacho-Olivares in thePhilippine Daily Inquirer. Land reform, the centerpiece programof her administration, is dead.Abad's troubles began in February when he tried unsuccessfullyto block the lease of government land in Cavite province to Japan'sMarubeni Corp., for an industrial park.Although the deal was approved by the National DevelopmentCorp., Abad, a former congressman, said the land should bedistributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program.The Department of Trade and Industry said the Marubeni deal wascrucial to attracting much-needed foreign investment for thegovernment's industrialization program.But the Department of Agrarian Reform said if the Cavite landwas exempted, hundreds of landlords would try to have theirproperty declared as a potential industrial site to avoid losingtitle.The presidential staff finally worked out a compromise underwhich farmers would be offered either land or a cash settlement.Abad reluctantly agreed to the formula under repeated orders fromMrs. Aquino.Abad's firm stand, however, alarmed landowners in Congress, whofloated rumors in the press that the Agrarian Reform Department wasriddled with Communists.Lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to thepro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party blocked Abad'sconfirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned.Despite the party's victory, poltical damage to it and Mrs.Aquino was considerable. The Manila press transformed Abad into afolk hero, depicting him as the champion of the farmer againstpolitical barons of the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party,dubbed Landlord-Dominated Party.Worry not about Abad's destiny, Mrs. President, wrotecolumnist Carol Arguillas in The Manila Chronicle. Worry aboutyours and how you blew the last chance for liberal support.Mrs. Aquino pledged publicly to work for Abad's confirmation,but her lobbying appeared ineffectual. Abad's strongest opponentsincluded politicians who consistently support Mrs. Aquino, leadingto speculation she was not disappointed when he departed.Abad's opponents included her younger brother, Rep. JosePeping Cojuangco, who wields considerable influence ingovernment.There is no way Cory Aquino will challenge Peping, said oneWestern diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.Mrs. Aquino comes from a landlord family. She and her brothersand sisters are partners in a 14,500-acre sugar plantation inTarlac province. Rather than break up the estate, they used a legaloption and created a profit-sharing plan for the tenants.The Abad controversy was the latest in a series of blows to theagrarian reform program, once touted as the centerpiece of theadministration.Last year, Agrarian Reform Secretary Philip Juico resigned afterdisclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sums formarginal land.His successor, Miriam Defensor Santiago, was repeatedly rejectedby the Commission on Appointments, only to be reappointed untilMrs. Aquino replaced her with Abad on Dec. 31.No reason for the change was given. But Mrs. Santiago claims shedid not display sufficient public loyalty to Mrs. Aquino during acoup attempt in early December.Agrarian reform was widely seen as a means for breaking thepower of landlord families and uplifting the livelihood of millionsof peasants. The program was advertised as essential in curbing the21-year-old rural-based Marxist insurgency.Mrs. Aquino proclaimed a land reform program in 1987 but leftdetails to Congress. The final bill contained so many pro-landlordloopholes that several of its original sponsors, including Abad,voted against it.President Corazon Aquino has agreedto allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines so that thegovernment can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars,newspapers said Saturday.The Manila Bulletin and The Manila Chronicle quoted Mrs.Aquino's press secretary, Teodoro Benigno, as saying that Mrs.Aquino made the assurance to two Swiss lawyers before she visitedSwitzerland earlier this month.The reports did not say when criminal charges against Marcos,Aquino's ousted predecessor, will be filed or when Mrs. Aquino willallow him to return.Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos into the Philippines,citing security reasons. Marcos lives in exile in Hawaii.Mrs. Aquino's government has said it will file criminal chargesagainst Marcos, whom it has accused of stealing up to $10 billionin government funds. But the government has not done so because ofMrs. Aquino's refusal to let Marcos enter the country.Philippine law does not allow trial in absentia.Swiss lawyers are helping the Philippine government trace moneythat Marcos and his family allegedly placed in Swiss bank accounts.Marcos has been living in Hawaii since he was toppled by thecivilian-military revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to power inFebruary 1986.The Swiss government has frozen the assets of Marcos and hisassociates and has not released information on them to thePhilippine government because of legal challenges posed by Marcos'lawyers and Swiss banks.The unidentified Swiss lawyers said the information will not beturned over unless and until there is an assurance that formalcharges will be filed against him, Benigno was quoted as saying.Swiss law allows the lifting of banking secrecy laws only incase of criminal prosecution.Mrs. Aquino has said she would allow Marcos to return now onlyif he and his family swore allegiance to her government andreturned the money he allegedly stole during his 20-year rule.She said later she would abide by any court decision if Marcos'lawyers in the Philippines raised the matter of his return to thecourts.Benigno was quoted as saying that Mrs. Aquino has to acceptthe possibility of Marcos returning home.President Corazon Aquino of thePhilippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders toexpand economic ties with her nation.Mrs. Aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nationEuropean tour, met with West German President Richard vonWeizsaecker, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and otherofficials.Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavilyindebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany afterWorld War II, asked that Germany share its experience with herhomeland.We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery atthe price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of nationalhonor, she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industryand Trade.We have paid as careful attention to the consequences ofrunaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her ownexperiences between the wars, she said.Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increaseto $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that was infact stolen by the previous government of ousted dictatorFerdinand Marcos.She said that since her government took over in 1986, thecountry's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 hadimproved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.What we need to complete the equation are two elementsessential to the German recovery  debt relief and investments,Mrs. Aquino said.During a state banquet in the evening, Weizsaecker told Mrs.Aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between WestGermany and the Philippines.Weizsaecker said the Philippines have had good results in tradewith West Germany, and assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-freemarket the European Economic Community plans for 1992 will not lockout trade with other countries.Mrs. Aquino, who arrived in West Germany on Sunday, will meetwith Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday before departing for Paris.She also is to visit Belgium.President Corazon Aquino on Fridayrefused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and saidher government won't permit him to be buried here despite a lastappeal from his wife.The 71-year-old Marcos was in critical condition Friday in aHonolulu hospital after emergency kidney surgery. Hospitalofficials said the ousted leader was suffering from renal, cardiacand pulmonary failure.Marcos' wife, Imelda, broadcast an appeal Friday to Mrs. Aquinoto allow her husband to die in his homeland, and his supportersthreatened mass protests if the request is rejected.But Mrs. Aquino refused to withdraw her ban on Marcos, and thePhilippine Supreme Court rejected a petition from the formerpresident's lawyer, Juan David, to order the return. Marcos haslived in Hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popularuprising that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.I would like first of all to convey to the family of Mr.Marcos that I do pray that he will still recover from this latestcritical illness, Mrs. Aquino said. I regret very much it isnot possible for us to allow him to return.She said she has said in the past that we will not allow hisremains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans toavoid any untoward incidents.Mrs. Aquino, whose government has survived six coup attempts,has cited national security in refusing previous requests.In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs.Marcos said she has tried to telephone Mrs. Aquino from Hawaii butwas told the president was busy.Maria Elena Cruz, Mrs. Aquino's daughter and personal secretary,said the president received no calls from Mrs. Marcos.Mrs. Marcos said she was trying to contact the president tomake a last appeal to Madame Corazon Aquino to open her heart andlet Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.My countrymen, I am appealing to each and every one of you topray that, hopefully, Mrs. Aquino will know that bringing homeMarcos will bring true reconciliation, true peace and unity for ourcountry, Mrs. Marcos said. This is what's best for thecountry.Mrs. Aquino had said earlier: I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos,if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I havesaid in the past, much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, Istill have to consider also the rights and interests of millions ofFilipinos.When told of Mrs. Aquino's statement, Mrs. Marcos said We areaware, but I am a believer and I am an optimist. I know miraclescan happen.Marcos supporters, meanwhile, announced they would hold ralliesSaturday to pray for his recovery. Pro-Marcos leaders warned theformer president's death in exile would trigger demonstrations.We expect tactical alliances in this nationwide mass action,said pro-Marcos lawyer Oliver Lozano. We refer to the tacticalalliances of the military, labor sector and student sector.But the chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, said the armedforces would accept Mrs. Aquino's decision and was prepared toblock any attempts by the opposition to foment trouble.We will do everything in our power to see to it that law andorder prevail, de Villa told reporters. We will follow anydecision by the executive branch.","AP900829-0044,AP890519-0060,AP900408-0059,LA101390-0087,AP880625-0142,LA120389-0170,AP890710-0170,AP890519-0117,LA052089-0075,LA120189-0122",President Aquino Survives Controversies and Uprisings; Marcos Unwelcome Dead or Alive,"President Aquino, successor to Marcos, has survived two major coup attempts and several mutinies.

37,d080a,"There was plenty of blame to go around at theend of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestationtrial, but no one was willing to accept it.In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey andhis mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52child molestation charges. The jury deadlocked on 13 other charges.Afterward, the district attorney who filed the case criticizedthe current district attorney. The current district attorney blamedhis predecessor and defense attorneys. And some of the parents ofchildren who attended the school blamed everybody.The system is not going to protect children, said JackieMcGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested butdidn't testify in the case. Life is not fair, said RobertCurry, whose son attended the McMartin school. I tell my childrenall the time ... there is no such thing as fair.The district attorney who originally pursued the case said hewould not have done anything differently.Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissedaccusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984  with thenews media acting as eager accomplices  to boost his publicprofile as he ran for district attorney.I was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this casewas brought, he said. To have people who know very little aboutprofessional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personallythat I have some political motive is totally unjustified.Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeatedhim, current District Attorney Ira Reiner. Philibosian said Reinerhurt prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of theoriginal seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 60Minutes interview.But Reiner, calling his dismissal of charges for lack ofevidence the decision we're proud of, said the trial took solong because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system,delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind byPhilibosian.This is a case I inherited, Reiner said.In interviews, many jurors said they believed some of thechildren were molested, but the prosecution never established thatthe defendants were responsible.Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn'tnecessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,said juror Brenda Williams.Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestationcase denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and apolice department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case.Seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conferenceafter acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartinBuckey, on 52 molestation charges Thursday said they felt somechildren who testified may have been molested  but not at thefamily-run McMartin Pre-School.And they said some children may have merely repeated storiestold them by their parents and interviewers at Children's InstituteInternational.The private child therapy center, which specializes in abusedchildren, videotaped interviews with children from the McMartinschool after reports of molestations surfaced. Jurors saw the tapesin which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets andleading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation fromchildren.Asked what led to acquittals, juror Brenda Williams focused onthe taped interviews from the center jurors call CII.The CII interviews  I could not accept them, Mrs. Williamssaid. I believe the children believe what they were saying wastrue. But at CII, I could not tell if the children were saying whatwas told to them (by interviewers) or if they were repeating whattheir parents had told them.If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I hadnot seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,'Mrs. Williams said.The CII tapes did not help me. They gave me a lot ofreasonable doubt, agreed juror Julie Peters, 47, a supermarketmeat wrapper.The children were never allowed to say in their own words whathappened to them. All the questions were leading. They never had achance to tell their stories, said juror John Breese, 51, amedical technician and grandfather of five.I tried to believe the children, said juror Daryl Hutchins28, an oil company lease operator. But if the child was socontaminated (by the interviews) I couldn't.Equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by theManhattan Beach Police Department to parents of McMartin schoolchildren. The letter alerted parents to a claim of molestation atthe school and to Buckey's arrest.The police letter should never have been sent, said jurorSally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker. It put the informationout there too early. The whole city knew.At that point, jurors said, they felt parents had beenprogrammed to believe their children had been molested.One child said his parents told him that he was molested evenbefore he went to CII, Mrs. Williams recalled.The panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantasticallegations, including some children's accounts of being molestedin a car wash. We just dismissed those, said Mrs. Williams.They said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impactbecause they weren't sure what they were seeing in the photos ofchildren's genitals.Although they acquitted defendants of most charges, the jurorsdeadlocked on 13 counts. Some said they were unsure whether Buckeywas a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to proveits molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt.Jurors said they didn't rule out that some children in the casewere molested  but not by these defendants.Even if you accept that the children were molested, saidjuror Mark Bassett, the evidence didn't establish that they weremolested at the McMartin Pre-School.The panelists said they were aware of the trial's enormous tollon defendants as well as children and parents.I think everybody is a victim, said Ms. Peters. I don'tthink anybody came out of this case a winner. I think it's sadbecause everybody lost something. The defendants  their lives havebeen ruined. They lost their business, their reputation. It's sad.Mrs. Williams added, The children have to live with this. Theparents have to live with this. There's nothing I can say that willmake it better.As for themselves, the jurors said their lives were put onhold for nearly three years. Bassett lost his job as a researchcomputer scientist when his company folded. Mrs. Williams gotmarried. Breese said his wife died during the trial and he hassince remarried.It's been very hard, said Mrs. Williams, a telephone companyservice representative. There were days when I thought I couldn'tstand it anymore.I don't really know my job anymore, she said. It's goingto be hard getting back into the real world.The jury foreman and four other jurors declined interviews.The McMartin Pre-school molestation case wasthe longest criminal trial in U.S. history. Here is a chronology ofthe case:Ray Will Die is scrawled inbig black letters on the faded green paint of the McMartinPre-School, testimony to the rage inflamed by the notoriouschild-molesting case.Former McMartin teachers Raymond Buckey and his mother, PeggyMcMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday of 52 charges of molestingstudents. Jurors were deadlocked on 13 other counts.Whatever happens on those charges, few in thisupper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb would disagree with the judgein the trial, William Pounders, who once said, The case haspoisoned everyone who had contact with it.Sue Brown, a receptionist at a medical office across the streetfrom the school, said she had two friends who were involved in thecase and had been convinced of the Buckeys' guilt.I think they got off scot-free, Brown said. I'm reallysick about it.Alan Lagunoff, whose son, now 10, testified against the Buckeys,stood in front of the run-down, long-closed nursery school andtalked about his disappointment.The defense did everything to prolong the case and theprosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the caseproperly, he said.A cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as Lagunoffleaned on the rusted chain-link fence surrounding the dilapidatedL-shaped building.I'd like to see the school become a center for abusedchildren, he said. It should be put to some good use ratherthan tear it down.But another longtime Manhattan Beach resident disagreed.I'd like to see it torn down, said Brenda Platt. I'd liketo have no memories of this.Platt, who has two children aged 1 and 3, said she has seriousdoubts about placing them in a day-care center because of theMcMartin trial.I think (the McMartin case) is a disgrace to Manhattan Beachand society. It's totally upsetting, Platt said.Linda Geisert, another resident of the beach city, was alsoupset.I'm greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite franklyin the jurors, Geisert said.For all his disappointment, Lagunoff said he did not feel theprosecutors should retry the remaining 13 counts.It would be just more of the same circus, he said.We put so much faith and hope in our courts, said RobertCanter, 74. And this is what we get  frustration.A therapist defended her interviews ofalleged victims in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial,despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questionsundermined the prosecution's case.The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother,Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts anddeadlocked on 13 other counts.Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds ofMcMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are atodds with the legal standards required for a successful criminalprosecution.What is in the interest of children is not always in theinterest of the legal system, she said.Evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longestand most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history includedvideotaped interviews of the alleged victims.Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of thesexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker anddirector of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's InstituteInternational.MacFarlane said Thursday she still believes children from theschool had been molested and that they had not fabricated theiraccounts of abuse.This agency would never have gone all the way through what wehave if we did not believe these children, she said.At least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed theevidence showed children had been molested. But the jurors weresharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.The children were never allowed to say in their own words whathappened to them, said juror John Breese. All the questionswere leading.If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I hadnot seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,juror Brenda Williams said.But MacFarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound,noting that small children must be interviewed differently thanadults.I didn't put words into their mouths, she said. I tried toenable them to get over their fears.MacFarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have beendone differently, including conducting more interviews over alonger period of time. She called the outcome of the case atragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to thesechildren.But the institute's executive director, Mary M. Emmons, saidsome good may come out of the case.It has greatly increased the awareness about the issue ofchild sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting thesecases, she said.Thursday's acquittals in the McMartinPre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutorsbotched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph ofjustice over hysteria and hype.Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and RaymondBuckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced. Jurors found thepair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13other counts. Prosecutors must decide whether to try those chargesin a new trial.I just said, `I told you Ray,' Mrs. Buckey said. Asked ifher son was surprised, she said. He had fear, definitely.Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with hislawyer.If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen toyou, too. If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be heretoday, she said.But several parents of former students at the school said theBuckeys won because the system lost.It was never done properly, said parent Alan Lagunoff, whomoved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach. I haveto sit back and figure out what to do with my son. I fear thatbecause of this verdict, no child will be seen as a crediblewitness from now on.His son, now 10, attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't awitness at the trial.I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into thecourts. It will just be another six-year travesty, Lagunoff said.The system is not going to protect children, said JackieMcGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested butdidn't testify in the case. I don't know what the message is thatthe jury wanted to get out. I'm anxious to hear that.Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey,suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted thecase for its entire six years, was motivated by personal ambition.My concern primarily was Lael Rubin, who is `anything goes' inorder to secure a conviction. ... If you don't win, you don't getpromoted, he said.Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince thejury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges.Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn'tnecessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,Ms. Williams told reporters.Raymond Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bailduring the case, which defense attorneys said was the result ofcommunity hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholicmother of one child at the preschool.Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosianof using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-electioncampaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now runs the districtattorney's office.Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled thematter differently.Ira Reiner has had that case for five years, and I am notgoing to take any public criticism directed at me. Let him respondto the criticism, said Philibosian, now in private law practice.Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use aprivate child therapy group, Children's Institute International, toconduct the original interviews with the children. Defenseattorneys maintained that questions by the institute's researcherswere leading and prejudicial.Jurors agreed.We never got the children's stories in their own words, saidjuror John Breese.Children's Institute officials didn't immediately returntelephone calls seeking comment.Originally, there were seven defendants, including RaymondBuckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, thefounder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother ofRaymond Buckey.Hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in thecase, which gained worldwide attention with its tales ofunderground tunnels at the school and Satanic rituals.The focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years asReiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendantsafter reviewing the case. The underground tunnels were never found.No proof was ever produced of Satanic rituals.Reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long,expensive prosecution.It took far too long and cost far too much money to have whathas been called perfect justice. We need reform, Reiner said,adding that in trying to describe the case, Insane is the wordthat comes to mind.The case was the longest and the costliest in American judicialhistory, at 2{ years and $15 million. Superior Court Judge WilliamPounders said he did what he could to limit its length, cutting 50witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case.For parents and others, there was more to ponder than legalquestions.Life is not fair. I tell my children all the time ... there isno such thing as fair, said Robert Currie, whose son attendedMcMartin but didn't testify at the trial.It's really a travesty for a case to take this long, saidMs. Rubin, the prosecutor. ...Not only for the families, thechildren in this case, but also for the defendants as well.Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 countsin the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they aredeadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest,costliest criminal trial.Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from thejurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearingfor Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52sealed verdicts.In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would dealwith the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial onthose counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the juryback to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the juryback. However, the judge noted that The attorneys are hopeful allthe counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts.Pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys beforequizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further.The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and hismother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent ofcharges they molested children at their family-owned McMartinPre-School in Manhattan Beach.The jury that spent 2{ years hearing evidence in the case haveagreed on 52 verdicts. They have all been sealed. None of theverdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed bythe jury.Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations. Buckey and hismother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the oneshared count of conspiracy.One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors isthe conspiracy charge which names both defendants.Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convictone defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemedperplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they couldconvict just one of the defendants on the charge if you feel thatthe defendant conspired with one or more other persons.However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight allegedovert acts, some of them naming only one defendant. A splitverdict, he said, would require elimination of overt acts allegedagainst a defendant acquitted of the charge.It was at that point, he said, that some jurors began shakingtheir heads in confusion.Buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to standtrial after an 18-month preliminary hearing. Five women teacherswho worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charges against themdismissed. Among those were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and hisgrandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the prestigious but nowdefunct nursery school.On Tuesday, deliberations were halted at midday because a jurorbecame ill. On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m.because another juror's child was ill.No alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried thatlosing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial.","AP900119-0041,AP900118-0190,AP900118-0205,LA012290-0036,LA012190-0194,AP900119-0051,AP900119-0024,LA011990-0091,LA012090-0110,AP900118-0183,AP900117-0193",Buckeys acquitted in record trial; rancor remains; more will follow.,"The McMartin Pre-School molestation trial ended Thursday without any convictions.

38,d086d,"Tank-led Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait before dawnThursday, seizing the ruler's palace and other governmentbuildings, Kuwaiti officials reported.,The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein said theKuwaiti government had been overthrown.The invasion comes nearly two weeks after Iraq massed troops onKuwait's border in a dispute over an oilfield and Kuwait'sviolation of OPEC oil production quotas, which had kept down theprice of crude.The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait! one Kuwaiti officialshouted in a telephone interview.They have seized all administrative buildings, including theinformation ministry which houses the (state-run) radio andtelevision stations, said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital afew hours after crossing the border 40 miles away before dawn.The invaders, whose forces far outnumber those of smallerKuwait, were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the bruntof the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran. The troops set uproadblocks at major intersections in the capital.The invaders surrounded the palace of the ruler of Kuwait, SheikJaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the official said. Residents in thepalace's vicinity said it was seized after two hours of heavyartillery barrages.The whereabouts of the emir, whose family has ruled thecity-state for almost 250 years, was not immediately known.The bombardment of ports and airports was vicious, eyewitnessessaid.Thousands of residents attempted to flee south toward SaudiArabia in their cars. Kuwait's official radio broadcast a desperateplea for help from other Arab nations.The Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington reported only that there weremany casualties in the fighting, which follows a flareup in aprotracted dispute over a border oil field, but gave no numbersearly Thursday.Residents said there were about 50 tanks around the emir'spalace and the neighboring U.S. Embassy. The embassy did no answerits telephones.The British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the Sheraton andHilton hotels evacuated their clientele, sources said.The air space over Kuwait was closed, with airliners turned away.The Bush administration demanded immediate withdrawal of theIraqi forces and added that it was reviewing all options in itsresponse to the Iraqi aggression.U.S. warships have been on short-term alert 600 milessoutheast of the Iraq-Kuwait border since July 24 because of thetensions in the oil-rich Persian Gulf region, scene of heavyfighting in the Iran-Iraq war.The White House said it had no reports of harm to Americans. TheUnited States has extensive business ties to Kuwait, and the U.S.community in the nation  slightly smaller than New Jersey  issizeable, in the thousands.The White House denounced the incursion, issuing a statementthat said, The United States strongly condemns the Iraqi militaryinvasion of Kuwait ...We have conveyed this message to the Iraqi ambassador inWashington and to the Iraqi government through our embassy inBaghdad.We deplore this blatant use of military aggression inviolation of the U.N. charter.In New York, U.N. officials said the Security Council was tobegin an emergency meeting early Thursday.Reaction was swift elsewhere. The British government said thearmed incursion is clearly a grave threat to peace and stabilityin the area and of immediate concern to the international communityas a whole.The Iraqi action was expected to dominate talks betweenPresident Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when they meetlater Thursday in Aspen, Colo.Iraqi officials on Wednesday had abruptly walked out on talks inJiddah, Saudi Arabia, complaining that the Kuwaiti representativeswere not negotiating seriously. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypthad intervened beginning July 25 to set up the talks in a bid tocool tensions between the two OPEC members.In Baghdad, Saddam's government announced Thursday that theKuwaiti government had been toppled.Kuwait radio went off the air briefly, but came back ondifferent wavelenghs with martial music and Kuwaiti patriotic songs.Saddam's ruling council issued a statement from Baghdad sayingan interim government had been established in Kuwait but the claimcould not be immediately and independently confirmed.Iraq has responded to the request from interim government offree Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it, the Iraqi statementsaid.It said the troops  no numbers were given  were in Kuwait todefend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people. There was no furtheridentification of the revolutionary government.Iraq warned too that any foreign troops trying to interfere withits actions would be attacked.More than 60 percent of the country's 1.8 million residents areforeigners.Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavyartillery in a failed attempt to repulse them, government officialscontacted by telephone earlier Thursday said.Iraqi, which is the size of California, has an estimated 1million troops among its 17 million populace, compared to 20,300members of the Kuwait armed forces.In Baghdad, the official radio interspersed martial music withsongs with slogans like, Greetings to the Revolution in Kuwait.The invasion followed massive troop movements to the south onWednesday.In Kuwait early Thursday, the rattle of automatic guns soundedand explosions in rapid succession shook local residents from theirsleep and the Kuwaiti Cabinet quickly assembled.Residents in downtown Kuwait reported formations of French-madeMirage jet fighters of the Kuwaiti air force taking to the skies inthe direction of the border region.The streets were empty; some people on rooftops of their housesreported hearing gunblasts growing in intensity and speed. Momentslater army tanks and armored personnel carriers were moving in thedirection of the Royal Palace, apparently to reinforce the guards.Kuwait is a former British protectorate that gained independencein 1961. Its residents are among the wealthiest in the worldbecause of the country's vast oil reserves.In Tokyo, the dollar moved sharply higher along with oil pricesduring morning trading Thursday on news of Iraq's invasion.Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seemeddetermined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorialambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring Kuwait.The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflectedthe brutality Saddam has used to crush all opposition at home sincecoming to power in 1979.The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the presidentconsidered Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall inthe price of oil a personal affront to Iraq.Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is betterthan cutting means of living. Oh God Almighty, be witness that wehave warned them, he said last month after prices tumbled below$14 per barrel.He accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq$14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assignedby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.He also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping oilfrom a disputed field that straddled their border, and demandedthat Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraqduring the Persian Gulf war.Saddam was reported to be incensed that Kuwait was demandingrepayment for the wartime loans. Saddam said he fought the war toprotect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented bythe late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly ShiiteMoslem Iran.Never mind that Iraq started the war in 1980 by invading Iranafter a series of border skirmishes along the Shatt-al-Arabwaterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf.Despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory, thelong conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging on for eightyears. It has still not formally ended.The war bills kept the government from delivering materialbenefits promised to the Iraqi people directly after the war. The1990 budget slashed funds for imports and Iraqis were told to bracefor another year of austerity. Private investment has failed totake hold.Iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt. Its maingulf port of Basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructuredamaged. Tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war languish inIranian prisons and an estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed orwounded.Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's100 billion barrels.By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financialhangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstandingwish for more gulf coastline.Iraq's 100,000 troops massed at the border in the past few weekswere believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulateto Iraq's demands.But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new OPEC quotas andSaddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he wouldnot invade lulled the Arab world into the sense the crisis was over.Homage to the cause of Arab unity has been paramount in MiddleEast politics since postwar independence from colonial powers.Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s brought Egyptian andSaudi Arabian intervention on opposing sides, no Arab state hasever directly deposed the government of a fellow Arab League member.Despite Iraqi claims that it is helping internal oppositionliberate Kuwait, it has long coveted the tiny emirate.The Iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in1961 and threatened to attack then, but backed down when Britainlanded troops in Kuwait.The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors along the Gulf. It provedthe decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia,Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait wastoothless. The GCC did not issue a statement, much less implementits mutual defense treaty.While Iraq was unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use theprecedent of Kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policyissues. Bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of whathappened to Kuwait when it balked at Iraqi demands.Also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs, the fallof one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable.In a series of bellicose statements in recent months, Saddam hassought to focus domestic attention outside Iraq.In March he threatened to burn half of Israel with Iraq'schemical weapons  banned under international law  if Iraq wasattacked. It was a popular stance among Arabs frustrated with thelack of progress toward peace and a Palestinian nation in theArab-Israeli conflict.Then Britain arrested several people on charges they weresmuggling nuclear triggers into Baghdad. Weeks later, police inEurope impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable offiring chemical or nuclear shells into Israel.Saddam cried foul, claiming the West was trying to wreck thescientific progress of the Arabs.Saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late EgyptianPresident Gamal Abdel Nassar as the leader of the Arab world.His relentless personality cult has dubbed him The Knight ofthe Arabs. For Kuwait on Thursday, he was a dark knight.Asked the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador toWashington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said at a news conference:Ambition. Hegemony. Control of the whole area. There is not anyreason for it.Iraqi troops have launched an offensiveagainst Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, Weconfirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have nocomment.The attack started about midnight, Kuwaiti time (5 p.m. EDT),Bader said.Earlier in the day, the Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat, wassummoned to the State Department afternoon for a meeting withAssistant Secretary John Kelly.Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Kelly repeated to theIraqi envoy the U.S. desire for a peaceful solution to the tensionswith Kuwait and urged Iraq to respect to sovereignty of all nationsin the region.Kelly told a House subcommittee Tuesday that while the UnitedStates has no treaty obligations that would mandate militarysupport for Kuwait, the United States does believe strongly inrespect for territories of all states in the region.The United States, whose Persian Gulf naval patrols helped Iraqdefeat Iran in the 1980-1988 war, has six warships in the area.They have been conducting exercises since July 23 with forces ofthe United Arab Emirates, some 700 miles southest of Kuwait.Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwaitafter claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of theOPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq'srevenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field thatstraddles the border.Iraqi officials on Wednesday walked out on talks in Jiddah,Saudia Arabia aimed at resolving the 2-week-old crisis withneighboring Kuwait and complained that Kuwait was not negotiatingseriously.Iraq threatened to invade once before, in 1961 after Britainended its protectorate over Kuwait. Iraq then claimed Kuwait aspart of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side ofthe border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterredfurther action by Iraq.The British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the Sheraton andHilton hotels evacuated their clientele, sources said.Swiss charge d'affaires Franco Bessoni said on French radio thatthe palace was taken after bombardment by Iraqi MiG jet fighters.You can see black smoke over there .... No one dares to goout. You can hear gunfire. The entire foreign community is stayingindoors, he said.It's chaos, military jets are flying over all the time, KathyMcGregor, a Canadian, said by telephone at about midday. She saidshe could still hear artillery fire.The air space over Kuwait was closed, with airliners turnedaway. Iraq also sealed its own borders and airspace.Iraq said in a statement that it had responded to the requestfrom interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperatewith it.It said its troops  no numbers were given  were in Kuwait todefend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people. There was no furtheridentification of the revolutionary government.Saddam's ruling council also warned that any foreign troopstrying to interfere with its actions would be attacked.Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavyartillery in their failed attempt to repulse them, Kuwaitiofficials said earlier.The invaders were led by the elite Republican Guard that did thebrunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran. Iraq has anestimated 1 million troops  including reservists  among its 16million people, compared to 20,300 troops in Kuwait.Iraqi radio said 15 army divisions were being recalled andordered all men born between 1960 and 1966 to report to the armywithin three days.Today's fighting quickly sent oil prices surging ininternational markets. The price of North Sea Brent crude forSeptember delivery was quoted early today at $22.30 a barrelagainst Wednesday's London close of $20.40.Iraq, the world's second-largest oil producer, had demandedhigher oil prices at last month's OPEC oil cartel meeting in Geneva.Saddam had threatened military action against Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates for exceeding their cartel production quotasand driving crude prices down. OPEC agreed to cut output to boostprices.The invasion came a day after talks between Kuwait and Iraqcollapsed in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. Kuwait had apparently refused tobend to Iraqi demands.The crisis began July 17 when Saddam accused Kuwait of trying towreck the debt-ridden Iraqi economy with oil overproduction andbegan massing troops on Kuwait's border. He also accused Kuwait ofstealing $2.4 billion in oil drilled from the border oil field,Rumailah.Iraq also demanded the Kuwaiti island of Bubiyan, which isopposite Iraq's only outlets to the Persian Gulf.Iraq, which reportedly massed about 100,000 troops at the borderon Wednesday, has been engaged in a major defense buildup sinceSaddam came to power in 1979.But the Iran-Iraq war left it with a foreign debt of about $70billion. Iraq borrowed $10 billion to $20 billion from Kuwait wantsthat debt forgiven.In Kuwait early today, the rattle of automatic guns sounded andexplosions in rapid succession shook residents from their sleep andthe Kuwaiti Cabinet quickly assembled.The Cabinet was holed up at the headquarters of the SupremeDefense Council with telephone and telex links cut off, saidofficial sources.Kuwaiti radio briefly stopped broadcasting, then went back onthe air on a different wavelength. A speaker believed to be CrownPrince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah appealedfor Arab support.Oh Arabs, Kuwait's blood and honor is being violated, rush toits rescue ... the children, the women, the old men of Kuwait arecalling on you, the speaker said.Kuwait, nearly the size of New Jersey, is a former Britishprotectorate that gained independence in 1961. Its residents areamong the wealthiest in the world because of the country's vast oilreserves.Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq andKuwait over oil production and their common border.July 17  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving pricesdown, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf areconspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq'seconomy and undermine its military buildup.July 18  Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth ofoil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seekingto wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing downprices.July 20  Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst ofbelligerence is aimed at getting its creditors  including Kuwait to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88Iran-Iraq war.July 24  The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navywarships and aircraft are holding a short-notice exercise inthe Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 milessoutheast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait reinstates a state ofalert it declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tensionbetween the two oil-producing countries.July 25  The Iraqi government in Baghdad says that it will notbe intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboringKuwait, and Saddams summons the U.S. ambassador for talks.President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meetin Saudi Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute.July 26  OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproductionin hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates pledge to abide by the agreement.

Diplomats say Iraqhas massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple thenumber originally estimated. That number dwarfs the Kuwaiti army,which has a total of about 20,000 troops.Aug. 1  Iraq pulls out of talks on the 2-week-old border, oiland money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends its forces toinvade the oil-rich sheikdom.Aug. 2  Iraq's powerful army overruns Kuwait before dawn withtank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and othergovernment buildings.UNITED NATIONS  The United States urged other U.N. members attalks Sunday to impose broad economic and military sanctions onIraq. Western diplomats said the world body is expected to adoptthe measures.Should the U.N. Security Council impose comprehensive sanctions,it would be the first time since 1967 it has taken such actionagainst a member state. The last time such sanctions were imposedwas against the white minority government of Rhodesia.Western diplomats said they expected up to 14 positive votes onthe 15-member council for sanctions against Iraq. They said theyexpected no vetoes, allowing the legally binding measure to beadopted, probably on Monday. They said Cuba was the holdout.U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporters afterclosed-door talks Sunday that the council discussed the absolutenecessity of moving ahead toward a broad resolution of sanctions.He said he expected a vote Monday.Pickering said the United States had circulated six or sevendrafts of a detailed resolution. It calls for an embargo on Iraq'soil exports, an embargo on imports to Iraq, and a halt to all armsand other military supplies for Iraq.British Ambassador Crispen Tickell told reporters later that hedetected strong support, with the exception of one member, foraction and a vote tomorrow.Speaking of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Canadian AmbassadorL. Yves Fortier declared, This madman must be stopped.Cuban envoy Ricardo Alarcon said Cuba would vote for sanctionsagainst Iraq only if the council imposed sanctions on South Africafor occupying Namibia, Israel for occupying Palestinian territoriesand the United States for invading Panama.In Kuwait, the Iraqi-installed provisional government, in astatement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, told other countries torefrain from taking punishing measures against it or Iraq. Theprovisional government said countries have to remember they haveinterests and citizens in Kuwait.Kuwait's U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Abulhasan told reporters thatthe Iraqi-installed government was employing pure blackmail bysaying it could not ensure the safety of foreigners if theirgovernments support sanctions.In Aspen, Colo., British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherrenewed her call for the United Nations to apply a total economicembargo against Iraq unless it withdraws immediately from Kuwait.Iraq's invasion of Kuwait defies every principle for which theU.N. stands. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feelsafe again. The law of the jungle takes over, she said, inremarks at the Aspen Institute.The U.N. role in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis assumed increasingimportance after divided Arab nations cancelled an emergency summiton the invasion.On Thursday, the Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion,demanded immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal, andthreatened to impose sanctions if Iraq did not pull out.Sunday's session was scheduled after weekend meetings of thecouncil's five permanent members  the United States, the SovietUnion, China, Britain and France  and between the United Statesand representatives of the Non-Aligned Movement. They are thenations with the power to veto proposals.The United States contends that stiff sanctions by a unitedinternational front are necessary to punish Iraq and to force it towithdraw from Kuwait, which was invaded Thursday.The radio of Kuwait's new Iraqi-installedgovernment claimed that Iraqi troops began pulling out of Kuwait onSunday, but the United States said it doubted a withdrawal wasreally under way.The radio announcement came three days after Iraq invaded Kuwaitand one day after Baghdad said it had replaced the oil-richkingdom's ousted monarchy with a new government made up of nineKuwaiti army offices.Iraq also said Saturday that it was creating a new Kuwaiti armyand that 100,000 Iraqis, the approximate number of soldiers Baghdadtook over Kuwait with, had volunteered for the new military force.In other developments:The White House continued to seek the immediate andunconditional withdrawl of all Iraqi troops, and it thanked themany nations who have condemned the invasion and imposed economicsanctions on Baghdad.After several days of debate, Japan on Sunday banned all oilimports from Iraq and Kuwait and halted Japanese exports to bothcountries. Tokyo said it would suspend all loans to Iraq andKuwait, ban Japanese investment there, and freeze Iraqi assets inJapan. Japan, which imports 99 percent of its oil, had relied onIraq and Kuwait for more than 11 percent of its oil imports. TheWhite House hailed Japan's move and said Prime Minister ToshikiKaifu called President Bush on Sunday at Camp David to inform himabout the sanctions.Although tens of thousands of Iraqi troops reportedly remainedmassed near Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, Washington said onSunday there was no indication that any soldiers had moved intoSaudi Arabia.The White House said that 11 American oil workers rounded upafter the invasion had been brought to Baghdad, talked with U.S.Embassy officials, and were in good shape. It said that accountsfor all missing Americans.An unconfirmed report said a warplane from the deposed emir'sair force in Kuwait bombed an Iraqi military headquarters nearKuwait city. It was not clear where the plane came from or whetherits reported attack caused any damage.The radio of Kuwait's new government, monitored in Bahrain,quoted its military correspondent as saying the pullout beganat 8 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT).Iraqi President Saddam Hussein allowed reporters based inBaghdad to be taken south to Basra overnight to observe the firstIraqi troops return home.But at the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said onSunday morning: We have no independent or confirmable informationon this report (of the withdrawl beginning). Saddam Hussein'sactions in the past have raised serious skepticism about hisintentions.Iraq declared earlier that the provisional government installedby Baghdad is capable of ensuring security in the occupied country.Baghdad television has said the new government is headed by Col.Ala Hussein Ali and that he holds the positions of prime minister,commander-in-chief of the armed forces, minister of defense andinterior minister. The other eight members were lieutenant colonelsand majors.But Kuwait's embassy in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday dismissed thenew government as a list of fake names and said Ali is Saddam'sson-in-law.A similar report appeared in one of Cairo's leading newspapers,Al-Ahram. It quoted the Kuwait Embassy in Tunis which said that Aliworks with Saddam's administration in Baghdad.The Iraqi news agency carried a Kuwait-datelined statement itsaid was from the provisional government, denying any of itsmembers were Iraqis.In Jordan, Prime Minister Mudar Badran said his nation will notrecognize the new government because that would hinder Arab effortsto end the conflict.U.S., French and British warships, meanwhile, steamed toward thePersian Gulf. President Bush said Friday that if Iraq moved againstSaudi Arabia it would be attacking U.S. vital interests. OnSaturday, Bush said in Washington that the use of force inresolving the crisis remains an option. Saudi Arabia ships 1.2million barrels of oil to the United States daily.Fitzwater said on Sunday that there was no indication Iraqiforces had moved into Saudi Arabia, even though tens of thousandsof them have been reported to be within 5 to 10 miles of the Saudiborder.In Washington, Iraqi ambassador Mohammed al-Mashat on Saturdaydenied U.S. and other foreign reports suggesting that Iraq plans toinvade Saudi Arabia.Saddam ordered the invasion of Kuwait after accusing it ofstealing oil from a field that straddles their disputed border. Healso blamed Kuwait for a fall in oil prices that cost Iraq $14billion, saying it contributed to the oil glut by cheating on itsOPEC oil cartel production quotas.Iraq's powerful army invaded this small oil-richkingdom early today. Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler'spalace and government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia,Kuwaiti officials said.Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all governmentbuildings in the capital and were moving south toward the country'soil facilities. He appealed for U.S. military intervention.A Pentagon source said U.S. Navy ships were diverted to theregion, but President Bush said the subject of intervention was notbeing discussed.The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait! a Kuwaiti governmentofficial shouted in a telephone interview. Diplomatic sources inthe Persian Gulf estimated that more than 200 Kuwaitis were killedor wounded.The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed itinvaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged acoup and established The Provisional Government of Free Kuwait.Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the coup report a farce.The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait andIraq, caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from adisputed border area. Saddam also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPECproduction quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, a majorIraqi revenue source.The attack had wide-ranging ramifications:Oil prices soared $3 a barrel in early trading because of fearsthe invasion would disrupt supplies. Prices were about $2 higherlater.President Bush signed orders freezing Iraqi assets in theUnited States and blocking most Iraqi imports, including oil. Oilaccounts for 97 percent of Iraqi imports to the United States andmakes up about 3.5 percent of U.S. oil consumption. Bush also frozeKuwaiti assets to prevent Iraq from seizing them.The Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms supplier, halted weaponssales.The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to denounce the invasionand demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops.A Pentagon source said the aircraft carrier USS Independence,escorted by a six-ship battle group, was diverted from the IndianOcean toward the gulf, where other U.S. ships were alreadypatrolling.Secretary of State James A. Baker III planned to fly to Moscowto issue a rare joint statement Friday with Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze about the invasion. The plan, which wasannounced in Washington, illustrates the dramatic improvement inrelations between the superpowers, who once routinely lined up onopposite sides of most regional disputes.Kuwait's U.S. ambassador, Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, toldreporters in Washington: We are desperate for any help we canget. He appealed specifically for American intervention.In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000troops at the border. Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20,300soldiers.Bush said the United States would take whatever stepsnecessary to defend interests in the gulf. Asked if this includedmilitary force, Bush said: We're not discussing intervention.But he said he would not discuss military options publicly.It was the first time in modern history an Arab nation hadinvaded another and taken over its government.Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eightyears of war with Iran. Iraq has emerged as the Arab world'sstrongest and most militant military power, and Saddam has a vastarsenal of chemical and conventional weapons.Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital afew hours after crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn.Witnesses said the bombardment of ports and military airports byartillery and the air force was vicious.The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwait's ruler, SheikJaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah. Residents said the palace was seized afterabout two hours of heavy artillery barrages.Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al-Ahmed al-Sabah, one of the emir'sbrothers, was killed while trying to defend the palace.There were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboringAmerican Embassy, residents said.The al-Sabah family has ruled the city-state for almost 250years. The Kuwaiti ambassador said the leaders were safe in SaudiArabia.Operating from an unknown location, al-Ahmed's governmentresponded to the formation of the provisional government bystating: Kuwait is Kuwait to its people, let by the emir, SheikJaber, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad.

It quickly overran the Kuwaiti capital and then continued on to southern oil facilities.  The United States led the United Nations in condemning this action and imposing tough economic and military sanctions.","Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions by exceeding OPEC production quotas thus driving down oil prices.  He further accused Kuwait of ""stealing"" Iraqi oil from a common oil field on their border.  He then invaded Kuwait, claiming to do so at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  The United States led the western world and the United Nations in calling the coup a sham, denouncing this invasion and imposing strong economic and military sanctions on Iraq in an attempt to get them to withdraw.  Oil prices surged while Saddam warned against foreign intervention.  The U.S. dispatched warships to the area.","It appeared that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his countries financial problems and territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  Iraq emerged from its 1980-1988 war with Iran with a debt of approximately $80 billion.  Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions in oil revenues by exceeding OPEC assigned oil quotas, thus driving down the price of oil.  He further accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from an oil field common to their border and also of conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq economically and militarily.  Breaking off perfunctory negotiations with Kuwait, Iraq invaded, claiming it responded to a request for help from Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  Iraq quickly overwhelmed a mismatched Kuwaiti military, captured the capital and continued south to the oil facilities.  The United States called the coup a farce.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador asked the United States to intervene militarily.  U.S. President George Bush called for an ""immediate and unconditional"" withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  Although not willing to publicly discuss military options, Bush said all U.S. options remained open.  His administration led a United Nations embargo of Iraqi exports, including oil, and Iraqi imports.  Iraq retaliated by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait.",Saddam Hussein Defied United States and United Nations,"On August 2, 1990, after Saddam Hussein had charged Kuwait with unfriendly acts, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic moves by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq remained defiant and moved troops toward the Saudi Arabian border. As of August 6, 1990 the situation was ominous.","In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border. The two countries agreed to talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives walked out. The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of them to Iraq. As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.","On July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPECproduction quotas and of stealing oil from wells along the countries'disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a""short-notice exercise"" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would notbe intimidated by U.S. pressure. Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwaitagreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq hadmassed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. The next day Iraq pulledout of the talks and on August 2,1990 invaded and quickly occupied allof Kuwait. President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blockedmost Iraqi imports. The U.N.

40,d076b,"Former President Reagan thanked British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other alliesbacked down, heaping praise on his political soulmate as she headsoff into the sunset.Margaret Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partnerof the greatest personal integrity, Reagan said in a statementafter Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement.I could always count on her wise counsel, her firm support,and her loyal friendship, Reagan said.Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted byMichael Heseltine, who resigned as her defense minister in 1986.Reagan and the prime minister dubbed the Iron Lady formed aformidable duo in the 1980s and made no secret of their mutualregard. They often stood side-by-side at international gatheringsand called each other Ronnie and Margaret.Two years ago, as they met for the final time before Reagan leftoffice, the president said he was leaving the White House withconsiderable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcherwill still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.Reagan, who spent Thanksgiving with friends at his Bel-Air home,called her resignation in the face of strong opposition aselfless and courageous decision in what she believes is the bestinterests of her country.The former chief executive was always grateful to Mrs.Thatcher's support of his conservative approach to foreign affairsduring his own eight-year tenure.In 1986, when the U.S. bombing of Libya was criticized by worldpowers, Mrs. Thatcher was the only ally who supported Reagan andallowed the bombers to fly from British bases.When Britain fought Argentina for the Falkland Islands, theUnited States was forced to choose between two allies. Reagan sidedwith Mrs. Thatcher.She also encouraged Reagan's nurturing of the huge Pentagonbuildup, and backed U.S. efforts to install medium-range missilesin Europe, despite opposition from NATO allies.Both leaders adopted a hard line toward the Soviet Union, butwere quick to warm up to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev asthe Cold War thawed.Reagan credited Mrs. Thatcher's resoluteness for playing akey role in ending the tensions between the Western democracies andthe Eastern Block.She stood up to the Soviets and let them know she meantbusiness, he said.Both were ardent advocates of the free market and privateenterprise.While the United States became mired in debt in the era ofReaganomics, the British economy thrived on Mrs. Thatcher's radicalpolicies during her nearly 12-year rule. Average earnings were upby nearly one-third and more Britons owned their homes during hertenor.Like Reagan, however, Mrs. Thatcher was accused by liberals ofwidening the gap between the rich and poor in her country, and bothclashed with organized labor.For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher wasregarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trustedally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone ofadministration policies.Among Western allies, she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in1986 in supporting the U.S. bombing of Libya. In the Persian Gulfcrisis, she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troops to theMiddle East.You always know where she was and what she believed, Bushsaid upon hearing of her decision to resign. She has always beenan outstanding ally of the United States, he said. I will missher.There were many doubters around the world when Reagan arrived inWashington with an economic program of free-market capitalism thatseemed out of step with the times. Mrs. Thatcher wasn't one of theskeptics; she was advocating a similar program at home.They shared rocky relations with organized labor. Reagansuccessfully fired the nation's air traffic controllers, dealing adevastating blow to labor. She, too, smashed restive unions.On foreign policy, she frequently was more right wing thanReagan - certainly more so than Bush.Reagan never made any secret of his special affection for theBritish prime minister. They were ideological soulmates and calledeach other Ronnie and Margaret. At international gatherings, theyusually were side by side.Two years ago as they met for the final time before Reagan leftoffice, the president said he was leaving the White House withconsiderable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcherwill still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.She later wrote him a Dear Ron letter in which she praisedhim as a great president, one of the greatest.Like Reagan, she was deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union.Together they advocated a hard line toward Moscow and championedmilitary readiness - even though she was the first to recognizeMikhail S. Gorbachev as a leader she could do business with.Mrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagannurtured under the theme of peace through strength. She was a bigbacker of U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europeand always seemed cautious - perhaps reluctant - when it came todisarmament.When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the FalklandIslands, the United States was forced to make a painful choicebetween two allies. Ronnie sided with Margaret.Washington's special relationship with London seemed to slipwhen Reagan left power. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher disagreed publiclylast year over her government's decision to deport Vietnamese andCambodian boat people who were fleeing their countries to HongKong.Bush, a veteran of world politics, knew many leaders around theglobe. Mrs. Thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang.The Berlin Wall was collapsing and it appeared as if Bush foundGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs. Thatcher.She was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got theprized invitation to visit Bush at Camp David this year.Nevertheless, Bush said he expected the special relationshipbetween the United States and Great Britain to remain on a steadykeel.Mrs. Thatcher did her part, demonstrating her loyalty. Forawhile she and Bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions ofGorbachev's unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in Europe, andappeared uncertain how to respond.Under intense pressure from Congress, Bush began to warm to theSoviet leader. Now they seem almost best of friends.On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possiblemilitary force, and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make histhreat credible. Mrs. Thatcher, characteristically, was tougher.She said that unless Saddam Hussein got out of Kuwait soon, theWest would have to use military force to dislodge him.She called Saddam a loser, and the state-controlled Iraqinews agency replied that she was an old hag.Now, she is leaving. No one suspects that Britain's newleadership - whoever it is - will take a soft line toward Iraq.Yet, if the going gets tough, it might have been comforting forBush to be able to hear the tough old line from Thatcher.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's internationaladmirers praised her courage and achievements Thursday after sheannounced she would resign. Even her foes tempered scorn withpraise for a formidable adversary.Said President Bush, I will miss her.He called her an outstanding ally of the United States,adding, You always knew where she was and what she believed.Vitaly Ignatenko, spokesman for Soviet President MikhailGorbachev, told the independent Interfax news agency: Political,economic and cultural ties between our countries have become ofgreater importance in the Thatcher era. Our relations ... weremarked by constructivism and dialogue.The reluctance Mrs. Thatcher showed toward increasing Europeanunity was the source of most criticism. But in a joyful andunambiguous response, Iraq saw the Persian Gulf crisis as cause ofher downfall.Bitterness was undisguised in the comment from Argentina'sNicanor Costa Mendez, foreign minister during his country's 1982Falklands War with Britain.I can't say that it makes me sad, he said. I believe thatthe extreme positions - unnecessarily extreme, unjustifiablyextreme - of the prime minister were one of the causes of the war,and one of the biggest impediments to achieve agreement after.Socialist President Mario Soares of Portugal singled out hersystematic opposition to the advances of the European Community.During her long mandate, he said, the preoccupations ofsocial justice receded many times before purely developmentobjectives, causing a climate of discontent in British publicopinion to which Mrs. Thatcher appeared insensitive.But Soares also lauded the British prime minister as adetermined politician (who) took courageous positions on criticaloccasions in international life and without doubt marked an era inthe contemporary history of her country.German Finance Minister Theo Waigel noted, Despite hercritical position on some questions of European integration, sheaccomplished a great deal for European politics.A neutral letter from Socialist President Francois Mitterrand ofFrance told Mrs. Thatcher she had marked an important moment inthe history of your country and that of Europe.Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said growingopposition to her hard line against Iraq over its invasion ofKuwait buried Mrs. Thatcher just as the 1956 crisis overBritain's attack on the Suez Canal ruined former Prime MinisterAnthony Eden.Britain stepped in after Egypt nationalized the canal.On Thursday, Britain announced it was nearly doubling its troopsdeployed in the gulf as part of the multinational force arrayedagainst Iraq, sending 14,000 more soldiers to join the 16,000already in the region.South African President F.W. de Klerk praised Mrs. Thatcher, whoopposed sanctions on South Africa, for standing up to worldpressure and standing by Pretoria.She had faith in South Africa's ability to solve its problemsin a democratic way ... She had the courage of her convictions,he said.Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel saidafter hearing ofher resignation that Israel feels a moment of sorrow because weall know this special personality, Mrs. Thatcher, who did manythings and was an outstanding leader.Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said the British primeminister is a rare leader of firm convictions who was invigoratedthe United Kingdom and I feel great regret that she has withdrawnfrom the front line.Belgium's prime minister, Wilfried Martens, applauded thedetermining role she played during more than 10 years in her owncountry and on the international scene.Said Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia, Even those likemyself who have been at odds with Margaret Thatcher on particularissues have admired her courage and tenacity of purpose.Whatever the forces arrayed against her, she was alwaysprepared to pursue with the utmost vigor those positions in whichshe believed.Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said, In the many years thatshe placed such an important stamp on the policies of the UnitedKingdom, Mrs. Thatcher has shown that she does not avoid makingdifficult decisions that she deems to be in the nation's interest.This, too, is such a decision which deserves respect.Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, now alegislator in the European Parliament, said Mrs. Thatcher'sdecision to quit was dignified and courageous.Margaret Thatcher will be seen with Winston Churchill as thegreatest British prime minister of the last 50 years. The curtainhas fallen on the Iron Lady. She deserves our congratulations.Even European Commission President Jacques Delors, Mrs.Thatcher's archenemy in Europe, spoke of his high esteem forher, despite their differences.Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader of Germany's governingChristian Democratic Union, said Mrs. Thatcher played a major rolein securing Western solidarity in the historical conflict forfreedom and democracy. We thank her for that.Former President Reagan spoke with great warmth of his closestforeign ally.Margaret Thatcher's resoluteness played a key role in endingthe Cold War, he said. She stood up to the Soviets and let themknow she meant business. Her deep and abiding dedication to theprinciples of liberty and democracy served as an inspiration tooppressed peoples everywhere who knew that Margaret Thatcher wouldnever waver in her belief that all men and women are entitled tolive in freedom.Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a womancould achieve in British society, but her critics say she didlittle else to help women along.For some, it was enough that her political career reached theheights.One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatcher's successorwould hold, since he couldn't be called prime minister, that's agirl's name.Emma Nicholson, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it was onceunthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister.She has broken the mold once and forever, Ms. Nicholson said inan interview.Mrs. Thatcher, who trained as a chemist before studying law,said she viewed herself as prime minister, not as a woman. Shebelieved the battle for women's rights had been largely won and wasno believer in feminism.What has it ever done for me? she once asked.Mrs. Thatcher, who stepped down on Thursday, urged women to getinvolved in politics, but did little to pull them up the ladder.Several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executiveposts in various ministries, but the only woman to serve in aThatcher Cabinet was Baroness Young, leader of the House of Lordsfrom 1981 to 1983.The truth is that although Mrs. Thatcher is a woman, shedoesn't believe in the advancement of women, Clare Short, a LaborParty lawmaker, said last month.Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any otherprime minister would have had several women in and out of theCabinet.It's Margaret's fault that the only people standing (tosucceed her) wear trousers, Mrs. Currie said last week. Trree menare vying to succeed her as Conservative Party leader and thusprime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for Tuesday.Traditional male attitudes remain strong in Britain, from theupper-crust, all-male clubs of London to the topless women pictureddaily in the tabloid press.Women are paid less than men and are poorly represented inmanagement jobs and in Parliament.However, campaigners for women rights say there are encouragingsigns at the grassroots.The critical mass of women have entered middle management ingovernment and business, said Lesley Abdela, a founding member ofthe 300 Group.The group seeks equal representation for women in the 650-seatHouse of Commons, which now has 43 female members.Women represented 43 percent of the British labor force in 1988,compared with 40 percent in 1979 when Mrs. Thatcher became primeminister. Britain has a higher proportion of working women thanother European Community countries.Though Mrs. Thatcher never made a priority of women's issues,she did introduce some helpful legislation: tax concessions forworkplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; andlegislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits.But as prime minister, she angered feminists by oftenemphasizing women's traditional roles of homemakers andcare-givers.Angela Rumbold, the Conservative Party's minister for women'sissues, contends that an enormous amount has been done forwomen during the Thatcher years.I'm not sure what she could have gone beyond promoting peoplewho were there just because they were women, she said in aninterview. Margaret Thatcher is a great meritocrat. She believesin getting people to succeed on their merits.Jo Hawkins of the 300 Group, which is seeking equal numbers ofwomen in the House of Commons, believes Mrs. Thatcher'sextraordinary abilities made it difficult for her to understand theneeds of the average woman.She would say that anybody can do it, just stick to yourprinciples and get up and do it, Ms. Hawkins said. I thinkbecause of her character, her personality and her amazingself-confidence, she isn't aware of how the normal personstruggles.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has weakened herposition and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plansto step down after winning another term, opposition leaders andpolitical observers said.A pro-Thatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated theobvious and that her statements were no cause for astonishment.Mrs. Thatcher told The Sunday Correspondent in an interviewpublished Sunday that she hoped to lead her Conservative Party to afourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would tryfor a fifth.I think people would think it was time for someone else tocarry the torch, she told the newspaper.The Sunday Times of London said in a commentary: Mrs. Thatcherhas committed a colossal blunder.She has given the riders for the Tory succession theirstarting orders years in advance of the actual race, thenewspaper said.The next election must be held by the summer of 1992, but it isexpected Mrs. Thatcher will call it in 1991.Mrs. Thatcher, who turned 64 last month, has never previouslymade it clear in public when she plans to retire as party leader.She was elected in 1979, the first female prime minister in Europe,and won re-election in 1983 and in 1987, when she said she plannedto go on and on.Earlier this year, Mrs. Thatcher overtook Liberal Lord Asquith's1908-1916 tenure as prime minister to become Britain's longestcontinuously serving prime minister of the 20th century.Mrs. Thatcher's popularity is the lowest of any prime ministersince opinion polls began in Britain 50 years ago, and seniorcolleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadershipstyle following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief,Nigel Lawson.Lord Callaghan, former Labor prime minister whom Mrs. Thatcherdefeated in 1979, said her comments had considerably weakened herposition.If her party wins the next election, it is expected Mrs.Thatcher would step down before her term ends to allow hersuccessor to choose a time to call a new election.My guess is that the Tory party will want someone as leaderwho could take them through the next Parliament, Callaghan said.If Mrs. Thatcher resigns while in office, her successor electedby the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval ofQueen Elizabeth II, but convention dictates that he or she seek amandate in a general election as soon as possible.The Sunday Times speculated she would step down by 1994. Mrs.Thatcher would celebrate her 69th birthday that year and herhusband, Denis, will be 79 and his age may have been a factor inher decision, the newspaper said.The newspaper predicted the opposition Labor Party will try topromote leader Neil Kinnock as the occupant-in-waiting of 10Downing St., who is ready, able and willing to complete a fullterm.Kinnock called Mrs. Thatcher's comments the interview ofsomeone preparing herself for quitting. Mentally, Margaret Thatcheris preparing herself for packing her bags.In an editorial today, the pro-Thatcher Daily Telegraph saidMrs. Thatcher was merely stating the obvious by indicating shewould not seek a fifth term.Even were she not to fight a fifth election, Mrs. Thatchercould yet enjoy seven more years in charge, it said.By then she would be in her 70s, and her devoted husband adecade older ... Nonetheless, what other politician would beexpected to entertain an inquiry about his or her intentions inseven years time? And can it really be a cause for astonishmentthat Mrs. Thatcher is unwilling to commit herself to politicalactivity in her mid-70s and beyond?","AP901123-0062,AP901123-0002,LA112390-0008,LA040689-0198,LA112190-0001,AP901122-0100,LA120890-0055,LA112090-0165,AP901126-0053,AP891106-0072","Britain's Iron Lady, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, resigns on Thursday.","The Iron Lady of British politics, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, retired on Thursday.

The move was seen as an attempt to head off a campaign by former defense minister Hazeltine to wrest control of the Conservative Party. The announcement took President Bush, and other world leaders, by surprise. Mrs. Thatcher's special relationship with the Reagan administration was well known. Strong willed, the Iron Lady, was prime minister for over 11 years, longer than any other prime minister of this century. While prime minister, she is credited with turning around the declining British economy as well as helping shape international politics.","Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Lady of British politics, resigned Thursday. Serving for over 11 years, longer than any prime minister in the 20th Century, the announcement of her resignation took the world by surprise. Mrs. Thatcher was the first woman prime minister in Great Britain and is credited with reviving the faltering British economy in the early '80s. Former President Reagan had nothing but praise for Mrs. Thatcher. While he was still in office, the two shared a special relationship, calling each other Margaret and Ronnie and often appearing together at international gatherings. The relationship with American cooled with the coming of the Bush administration but had improved in recent months. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev also had nothing but praise for Mrs. Thatcher and her attitude to the Soviet Union softened after her meeting with him. Her critics were not less vocal. Iraq rejoiced at her departure, while Argentina was guarded it its comments. Critics at home complained about her lack of sensitivity to women's issues. Queen Elizabeth II, awarded Mrs. Thatcher the Order of Merit on Friday while elevating her husband, Denis, to the hereditary title of baronet, dispelling rumors of animosity between the two women.",,,,,,,,

He is accused of issuing shoot-to-killorders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall.Honecker has denied all charges against him, including that hewas personally responsible for the estimated 200 people who diedtrying to escape his repressive government.He has taken refuge at a Soviet military hospital in Beelitz,outside Berlin.Soviet officials have said Honecker is staying at the hospitalfor humanitarian reasons, and German police need permission fromthe Soviets to gain entry.I demand that the Soviet government immediately release ErichHonecker and extradite him to German justice officials, theOsnabrueck newspaper quoted Gerster, a member of Kohl's ChristianDemocrats, as saying.Honecker's fate is one of the first issues facing Bonn andMoscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the twonations closer together.Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, whois expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Mondaymorning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, theofficial news agency ADN said.The news agency said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested afterbeing released from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he hadundergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.Honecker was immediately taken to East Berlin's Rummelsburgprison, the brief dispatch said. Honecker joins other members ofhis ousted Politburo already in prison awaiting trial.Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker andformer state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged withtreason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions andstate funds.Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled EastGermany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previouslybeen declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.ADN said that the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. PeterAlthaus, repeated on Monday that in his opinion Honecker was stillnot well enough to be jailed.On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper saidHonecker would be arrested, but that he would be held at a prisonhospital because of his condition.

Honecker, 78, was jailed for one day inJanuary.Mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police, known asStasi, which built up files on 6 million East Germans and kept atight rein on the population. He was one of Honecker's closestaides.After the popular revolt last fall that ousted the Communistregime and opened the way to German unification, Mielke and otherformer Communist leaders were jailed.Mielke remains in custody. Honecker was released from jail forhealth reasons.West German authorities on Tuesday opened a criminalinvestigation of Mielke. He is suspected of giving sanctuary tomembers of West Germany's leftist terrorist group, the Red ArmyFaction, and of setting up contacts between the group andPalestinian guerrillas.Honecker is also the target of several criminal investigations,one in West Germany for obstruction of justice.Bild said the imprisoned Mielke also accused other formerCommunist officials of betrayal and threatened to retaliate againstthem.One prison warden told Bild that many of the guards had workedfor Mielke's Stasi and that they might interpret his threat againstHonecker as an order to kill the former Communist chief.Bild said Mielke and other members of Honecker's ruling circlewill be moved to a West Berlin prison after German unification onOct. 3.Honecker also will be moved to the same jail if his healthimproves enough for him to be imprisoned. He is suffering fromkidney cancer and is being kept at a Soviet military hospitaloustide East Berlin.Former East German leader ErichHonecker may be moved to a monastery to protect him from a possiblelynching by enraged citizens, a newspaper said Wednesday.In a front-page story, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper saidLynch Danger  Church Wants to Grant Honecker Asylum.Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Partyleader and other party officials have come under investigation forcharges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.In December, seven former Politburo members were arrested, andHonecker was placed under house arrest in the government housingarea of Wandlitz outside East Berlin.The Wandlitz homes, including the one in which Honecker stilllives, are being converted to a medical rehabilitation center forchildren. Honecker is expected to be forced out of the compound inFebruary.Bild said it had information that Lutheran and Catholic churchsources have offered Honecker  who is threated by public rage protection and refuge.This is the only possibility to protect Erich Honecker fromthe rage of the East German people, Bild quoted the source assaying.It was the churches that became the venues for gathering ofpro-democracy groups that eventually brought the overthrow of his18-year leadership.In recent weeks, East German groups have called for punishingHonecker and for moving him to smaller quarters with an outsidetoilet, Bild said.The current leadership fears that in such a situation, Honeckermight be attacked and become a victim of lynch justice, Bildsaid.Honecker, 77, underwent gall-bladder surgery in August, and EastGerman media reported he remains seriously ill.Sources say the ailing ex-leader may be placed in achurch-operated home for the elderly, or even in a monastery,Bild reported.East Germany's deposed Communist leader ErichHonecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to betried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.ADN, quoting a Health Ministry statement, said Honecker wasstill recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January and wasnot well enough to be incarcerated.But a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in conditionto be questioned and to stand trial, ADN said.Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he wasousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations sweptthe country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communistgovernment and the opening of the Berlin Wall.The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communistofficials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were allfit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.It said former secret police chief Erich Mielke, formereconomics czar Guenter Mittag and former labor chief Harry Tischwere under arrest, while the other four remained free. All threehad been members of the ruling Politburo under Honecker. Mielke wasarrested on Thursday.Honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse ofoffice. They had been arrested soon after Honecker's fall but werelater released because of advanced age and poor health.Honecker has been staying at a Soviet military hospital outsideEast Berlin.ADN quoted Federal Prosecutor Guenter Seidel as saying heintended to continue his investigation against the former EastGerman leaders, although their poor health often disrupted theproceedings.BFN[Text] Berlin -- Erich Honecker, the former GDR head of state, died at his house in Santiago, Chile on Sunday morning [29 May], according to his lawyer. Lawyer Nicolas Becker, who had represented 81-year-old Honecker before the Berlin court in 1992 and early 1993, told DPA on Sunday afternoon that Honecker had rejected an operation. However, everything that was sensible had been done with regard to his cancer.Becker could not comment on the exact cause of Honecker's death. His colleague, Wolfgang Ziegler, had said earlier that the former most powerful man in the GDR had obviously died from his liver cancer.Becker said he did not know whether Honecker has left a will or where the funeral would be held. This will be decided by the family.He also said he cannot say whether Margot Honecker, who had informed Becker of her husband's death, will be allowed to stay in Chile. After being released from prison in 1993, Honecker had traveled to Santiago to join his daughter, who is married to a Chilean. Since then, he and his wife had been living in a house in a wealthy Santiago area.Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker willnot stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communistcountry exists, a West German newspaper reported.The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag said Saturday that it wouldreport in its Sunday editions that Honecker could be prosecuted ina united Germany, however, for violation of property laws.Bild quoted Guenter Seidel, an East German prosecutor, as sayingthat Honecker had used $42 million for stocking a private housingestate for leaders of the former Communist government.However, Seidel said that the investigation was not far enoughalong to determine whether charges could be filed against Honeckerbefore East Germany merges with West Germany on Oct. 3.Negotiators are still working out the merger of the two Germanlegal systems.Honecker, 78, was ousted as East Germany's leader on Oct. 18,paving the way for the country's first freely elected government inMarch. Honecker is in poor health and remains confined to a Sovietmilitary hospital in Beelitz outside East Berlin.He is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power,corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill ordersto prevent East Germans from escaping to West Germany when heserved as the country's leader.Bild said that Erich Mielke, the ex-head of East Germany'sformer secret police, was also unlikely to go to court in EastGermany.I am at the end. I am a dead man, Bild quoted Mielke, 82, assaying at his last interrogation.Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker wasarrested and taken to prison today, and a prosecutor said he willtried for high treason in March.Honecker, 77, was detained after his release from East Berlin'sCharite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignantkidney tumor, the official ADN news agency said.Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph told Parliament thatHonecker and former Politburo members Erich Mielke, Guenter Mittagand Joachim Herrmann would be tried by the Supreme Court on treasoncharges in March. All four have been expelled from the party.Mielke was Honecker's security chief, Mittag oversaw the economyand Herrmann headed the party's propaganda department. Elevenmembers of Honecker's ousted Politburo already are in prisonawaiting trial.Honecker's lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, asked the chief prosecutor tofree the former leader from Rummelburg prison based on a doctor'sstatement that he is too ill to stay in jail, ADN said. Vogel isEast Germany's most prominent lawyer.One of Honecker's doctors, Horst Vogler, said the former leaderwas very depressed and his mental state impaired followingtwo major surgical operations since August.West German television showed an impassive Honecker being ledout of the hospital by his wife, Margot, in pre-dawn darkness. Shekissed him goodbye before he was taken away in a large limousine.Honecker's daughter, son-in-law and youngest grandchild alsocame to see him off at the hospital, ADN quoted Vogler as saying.The charge of high treason carries a maximum life imprisonment.The conviction used to carry the death penalty, but that wasabolished in reforms that followed Honecker's ouster Oct. 18.East Germany has been caught up in a virtual frenzy to root outcorruption and abuse of office.Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled EastGermany for 18 years, had previously been declared too ill towithstand imprisonment.ADN said the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. PeterAlthaus, repeated today that in his opinion Honecker is still notwell enough to be jailed.On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper saidHonecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prisonhospital because of his condition. ADN did not say whetherRummelsburg prison is equipped with a medical facility.Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered toput Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from thehospital.East Germany authorities on Fridayinterrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his rolein the killings of people who tried to flee the country.Honecker and Erich Mielke, head of East Germany's once-fearedsecret police agency, were interrogated by federal prosecutors,said Peter Przybylski, a Justice Ministry spokesman.More than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land minesas they tried to escape from East Germany's Communist rule.The government announced in June that Honecker, Mielke andseveral border guards would be investigated on possible murdercharges in connection with those deaths.Honecker, 77 and in failing health, and several other members ofhis ousted regime already have been charged with corruption andabuse of power.The murder charge could put Honecker behind bars for life, buthis poor health makes prosecution questionable. He is staying in aSoviet hospital outside Berlin.Last month, a medical panel ruled that Honecker was too ill tobe jailed pending investigation but fit enough to be prosecuted.Mielke was ordered jailed.East Germany's democratic government has changed its mindseveral times on whether to pursue charges against the agingmembers of the former hard-line regime that was toppled in lastautumn's pro-democracy protests.As protests gathered strength last fall, EastGermany's longtime orthodox leader Erich Honecker lost touch withreality, according to the man who succeeded him as Communistleader only to be ousted later.Egon Krenz, the successor, and former Politburo member GuenterSchabowski on Wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentalitythat engulfed the hard-liners toward the end.There was the notion in the former party leadership thateverything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged bythe Communist youth group was an action organized by enemyforces, Krenz told an investigating commission in East Berlin.The testimony was broadcast on East German television.Schabowski said Honecker had personally ordered police attacksagainst demonstrators in early October, working closely with histhen-secret police chief, Erich Mielke.Honecker took things into his own hands, Schabowski said.All decisions and orders that led to the police actions againstdemonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively throughHonecker and Mielke.Like Krenz, Schabowski denied any personal responsibility forthe orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital.The attempts at suppression were engineered by Honecker andMielke, bypassing the other 19 members of the ruling Politburo,Krenz insisted.Then-general secretary Erich Honecker and the internalsecurity chief Erich Mielke immediately after each session of thePolitburo consulted with each other on the security situation ofthe German Democratic Republic, Krenz said.Honecker and Mielke are now targeted for an indictment for hightreason.The East Berlin city government commission is probing possiblecriminal charges stemming from police brutality during the Octoberattacks in the capital.Club-swinging riot police brutally beat demonstrators on Oct. 7and 8, when Soviet President Mikhail S.

42,d075b,"The expensive practice of using ballooncatheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heartattacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessaryand should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receiveclot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of thecommon balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.Some experts said the results are good news, because they meanthat most heart attack patients can be treated in communityhospitals, where angioplasty is not available.The study also has an important financial message. Its authorsestimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heartattacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704million.This trial has settled one of the most important questions inmodern-day cardiology, commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of theUniversity of Washington, Seattle.The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial InfarctionTrial, or TIMI-II, directed by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Brigham andWomen's Hospital in Boston.The first phase of the study showed that giving people aclot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA,immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chancesof survival.The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the AmericanHeart Association, was intended to see whether people did betterstill if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages aftergiving TPA.At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomlyassigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of theirheart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they mightbenefit. Sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure,which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heartarteries to squeeze them open.A comparison group of 1,626 also got TPA. But they were notconsidered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain orabnormal exercise tests during their recovery.After 42 days, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group haddied or suffered further heart attacks, as did 10 percent of thosein the comparison group.A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival.About 93 percent of both groups were still alive.There does not appear to be any additional benefit fromangioplasty, Braunwald said.Dr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented,We have the answer in this trial to a very important question ofhealth care delivery.While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heartattack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labswhere angioplasty is performed.If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improvessurvival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs wouldneed to be established and more doctors trained to give theprocedure.The watch word is watchful waiting to see if patients needangioplasty. This ultimately makes it possible for patients to betreated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary carecenters if angioplasty is needed, said Dr. Howard Morgan,immediate past president of the heart association.Heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds theheart muscle. The purpose of TPA and similar drugs is to dissolvethese clots before the muscle dies. To be effective, the drugs mustbe given within about four hours of the start of heart attacksymptoms.Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victimsare considered to be candidates for the drugs. Many people delaygoing to the hospital until permanent damage occurs. In others, thetreatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgeryor a history of strokes.Balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people withclogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks. Thelatest study did not question the usefulness of this kind ofangioplasty.Deaths from heart and blood vesseldisease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains byfar the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, theAmerican Heart Association said Sunday.The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in thedeath rate from the biggest killer of our population, said Dr.Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is presidentof the heart association.Those trends are dramatic and don't seem to be reversing, shesaid. The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go.The association released the statistics at its annual forum forscience writers.Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination ofhealthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food,and improved medical treatment.The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been madein heart disease over the past 20 years, said Dr. Myron L.Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University. It's almost unbelievable.There is almost no form of heart disease that we can't approachwithout meaningful treatment.However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect of the heartassociation, also cautioned that much work remains, both inimproving care and encouraging people to take better care of theirhealth.I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemicheart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stopsmoking, get cholesterol treated if it's above 220, and identify andtreat hypertension, he said.Ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feedthe heart. It underlies most heart attacks, the single most lethalheart ailment.Association figures indicated that in 1986  the most recent yearfor which there are statistics  an estimated 978,500 Americans diedfrom heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart andblood vessels. Cancer, the No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.Between 1976 and 1986, the death rate from all forms ofcardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It declined 28 percent forheart attacks and 40 percent for strokes.The association's figures show that more than one in fourAmericans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almosthalf of those eventually die from it.About 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before thevictim reaches the hospital. Studies show that about half of allheart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to anemergency room.Weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to thehospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heartattacks. During this period, there is still time to give them drugsto dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks.This treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heartattacks.Other major goals, he said, include finding ways to improve theeffectiveness of angioplasty, a technique that uses balloons to openclogged heart arteries, and finding surgical and medical techniquesto identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest.The heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease willcost $88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages.Among other statistics released by the association:The most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure,which affects 60 million Americans.About 200,000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease eachyear occur in people under age 65.There were 1,418 heart transplants in 1987, almost nine times asmany as in 1983.About 2.5 million Americans have angina, the chest painresulting from clogged heart arteries. About 300,000 new cases occurannually.As many as 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks thisyear.A drug that eases the heart's workload cancut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent inpeople recovering from heart attacks, according to a major studyreleased Thursday.The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil,known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for the 1{ yearsafter a heart attack. Calcium blockers are among several classes ofmedicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.This is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blockermay be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction, or heartattack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.Several other studies of calcium blockers, including one largeU.S. study published last year, failed to find any benefit fromusing the medicines after heart attacks.According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effectiveas another variety of blood pressure medicines known as betablockers at protecting people after heart attacks.While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heartattacks, the researchers said these drugs still should have a rolein treatment.We feel it is important to have alternatives. Many patients donot tolerate beta blockers, said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard ofCentral County Hospital in Hillerod, Denmark, a co-author of thestudy.Beta blockers are generally not recommended for people withasthma and emphysema. This means the drugs often cannot be given tocigarette smokers, who are frequent victims of heart attacks.In the study, conducted at 20 community hospitals, doctorscompared 897 patients who got Verapamil after heart attacks with878 people who took placebos.After 18 months of followup, there were 146 deaths or recurringheart attacks among the Verapamil patients, compared with 180 inpeople who got the dummy medication.We wanted to see if an effect would be observed withVerapamil, said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen MunicipalHospital.If it had an effect, it should be seen in the first 12 to 18months, because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardialinfarction in this period, he said. Then it levels off. That'swhat we demonstrated. It worked.The researchers believe that by reducing the amount of workneeded by the heart to sustain circulation, calcium blockerslowered the chances of ischemia, episodes in which the heart's ownmuscle is deprived of oxygen.They said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to showany benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks. However,they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also takingbeta blockers. And this might have obscured any benefits fromcalcium blockers.The results were presented at a meeting of the American Collegeof Cardiology. Among other research described at the meeting:Dr. James H. Chesebro of the Mayo Clinic said a five-year studyfound that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existingblockages in the arteries feeding the heart, although it maymodestly protect against the development of new deposits. However,like other studies, this one found that aspirin signficantly cutthe risk of heart attacks.Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School said the nextphase of a large study of clot-dissolving drugs will see whateffect they have in unstable angina. This is a condition in whichpeople suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by workor stress. Until now, the drugs have been used only to treat heartattacks.An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterolof heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heartattack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significantdrawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.In the operation, doctors change the route of the smallintestine so about one-third of it is bypassed. This reduces theamount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who hadalready suffered heart attacks. The approach lengthened the livesof people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with moresevere heart damage.During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate amongsurgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24percent. In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percent.Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directedthe study, said the surgery should be considered along withcholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.It has a role in the management of patients with highcholesterol who have had a heart attack, Buchwald said. It iseminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not hada heart attack.Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhatmore prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinalobstructions.The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's NewEngland Journal of Medicine.Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remainabout whether it actually helps people live longer if they alreadyhave healthy hearts. Although the latest study was conductedexclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald saidhe believes the research should settle that question.It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid(cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered, Buchwaldsaid. It is a very powerful study and should, except for certainpeople who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterolcontroversy.In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacksunderwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people weretreated with diet alone. At the start of the study, their averagecholesterol levels were 251. The surgery lowered people'scholesterol 23 percent.The overall risk of dying from heart disease or sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among thesurgical patients with the healthiest hearts. The surgical patientsalso required less than half as many coronary bypass operationsbecause of clogged heart arteries.New treatments that stop a heart attack in itstracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quicklythan ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, astudy published today concludes.Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients homeearly. They found that these people had no unusual complications,got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.It was an extraordinarily safe strategy, said Dr. Eric J.Topol, the study's director. There were no problems with anyserious events.Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recentmedical advances  tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, andangioplasty.When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clotsin the heart's arteries and minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries withtiny balloons.The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trendof sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after evershorter stays.However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine saidmore research is needed before the findings are widely adopted.In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay inbed for one to two months after a heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in1955, he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital.However, doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm thangood. Patients got out of shape, developed blood clots and becamedemoralized.In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the1970s to two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalized seven to 10 days.In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heartattack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered forearly discharge. None of them had irregular heart beats, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attackdamage.Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the reststayed seven to 10 days. After six months of followup, none haddied, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar.However, people in the early discharge group were able to returnto work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medicalbills were significantly lower  $12,546 versus $17,868.The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attackpatients were discharged after three days, the annual saving wouldbe at least $280 million.In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputyeditor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not largeenough to spot complications that might result from reducinghospital stays.This single study, he wrote, is not sufficient to justifysweeping changes in current management practices for all patientswho may at first appear to have uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research supports its value, the Food and Drug Administration said. Taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some people's chances of dying of other things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, the agency said in a commentary in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. The FDA persuaded aspirin makers in March to refrain from promoting aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks, at least for now. A study published in January indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal, first heart attacks 47% in 11,000 male doctors over five years, compared with 11,000 who took a non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of blood platelets to help form clots. Heart attacks usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourishing the heart and choke off its blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risks for people who already have clotting problems, or for those who have high blood pressure, which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes, the FDA commentary said. Strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the brain or by blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by bleeding. The FDA commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 11,000 subjects taking aspirin in the recent study, compared with two such strokes among 11,000 subjects taking the substitute. Overall death rates for the two groups were the same, though the aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate was much lower. There were 104 nonfatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and 189 in the comparison group. ""Physicians, will, for a time, be forced to make their professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information,"" said the FDA commentary, co-written by agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree with them completely,"" said Dr. Julie Buring, a Harvard University researcher who participated in the aspirin study. She added in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study is under way, and researchers expect to report to the FDA in late fall. The commentary noted a British study, also released in January, of 5,000 male physicians that found that aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks, and that it was associated with a 2 1/2-fold increase in disabling strokes.A drug used to treat patients complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks infour out of five heart patients, according to a study published intoday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem,increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whosehearts pump abnormally, experts said.Even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of thedrug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctors said.The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States andCanada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, saidDr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the Universityof Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.The results suggest the drug may be quite effective indecreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majorityof patients, Moss said. But the study also surprisingly suggeststhat patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be givendiltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequentheart attack.We now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to,Moss said. That's what this study was all about.Diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker, the newest class of drugsto be introduced in the fight against heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blockers are the other types commonly prescribed by doctors.The study involved 2,466 heart attack patients, who were giveneither 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo. Patientswere recruited from 1983 to 1986 and followed for 12 to 52 months.Overall, the drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11percent, which was not statistically significant, Moss said.But in patients who had normal or near-normal heart pumpfunction  1,909 patients or 80 percent of the total group diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25percent, Moss said.In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not onlydidn't help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25percent.Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at StanfordUniversity, said he was surprised that the drug increased thechance of heart attack in any group and that overall results werenot higher.But the bottom line is that this is the first study to showthat diltiazem can be effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug ona long-term basis.Dr. George Beller, a cardiologist and professor at theUniversity of Virginia, said he was also somewhat surprised aboutthe increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonarycongestion.This is one of the first reports that seems to identifythat, he said.Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introducedin the past decade, Beller said, and research into how effectivethey are in various applications is in its early stages.Nitrates have been used for more than 50 years, and betablockers were developed in the 1960s.Aspirin sales jumped 41 percent for a few weeksearlier this year, not because of a rash of headaches.A study of more than 22,000 male doctors had shown that taking asingle aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half.The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for thefirst time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks but also to prevent them.In the most recent report, doctors found that one aspirin tabletand a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hourscan dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.Without the treatment, patients had a 13 percent chance of dyingfrom a second heart attack within five weeks, the researchersfound. With the treatment, the figure dropped to 8 percent.The real discovery is that treatment for patients is going toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, says Richard Peto ofOxford University, one of the study's authors.Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death, by far.The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 762,820Americans died of heart disease in 1987.To put it another way: Of the 2,127,000 American who died thatyear, more than one in three died of heart disease. (This does notinclude those who died of blood-vessel diseases, such as strokes.)The drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventingheart attacks are the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby,aspirin.The usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronaryarteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. Theblockage arises from the buildup of fats, cholesterol and clottedblood.Clot-dissolvers break up clots, thus restoring blood flow.Aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process, helping toprevent clot formation in the first place.The limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the UnitedStates show that many doctors are still not using them, despitetheir proven success. But that is beginning to change.Some doctors predict that in the not-too-distant future thesedrugs will be judged so safe that they will be administeredroutinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attackvictims even reach the hospital.We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to havethe courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitivediagnosis, says Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St.Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.The most important thing we can do is teach patients inadvance about the value of early treatment, he says.While most public attention has focused on this new ability toprevent heart attacks, researchers have also made importantprogress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heartattacks.Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determinedthat some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital assoon as three days after their heart attacks. Most heart attacksvictims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days.The patients given early discharge were able to return to worktwo weeks sooner than others in the study group. After six months,not one death was recorded in the early-discharge group. Theresearchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacksvictims could be safely discharged after three days.In July, Stanford University doctors found that workers who wentback to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks didat least as well as workers who went back after a more typicalconvalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks.All of these advances come at a time when public health expertsare increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and goodnutrition in lowering heart disease risk.Early next year, the American Heart Association seal of approvalwill begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesteroland therefore can help reduce heart disease risk.U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in July issued his firstreport on nutrition, calling on Americans to lower theirconsumption of fats and to eat more vegetables, fruits, fish,poultry and whole grains.The report has been likened to the first Surgeon Generals reporton smoking, issued in 1964, which focused public attention onsmoking's hazards. Koop's recommendations largely echo those of theAmerican Heart Association, but they should help carry the messageto many more people.Progress in research on heart disease is making clear that theheart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes withoutwarning and cannot be defended against.Much can be done to prevent heart attacks, great improvementsare being made in treatments, and recovery is faster than everbefore.The use of a clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save25,000 lives a year in the United States, doctors say.These results, says Dr. Peter Sleight of Oxford University,will change medical practice worldwide.A natural substance called transforming growthfactor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cellsfollowing a heart attack, according to a study published in thejournal Science.In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, agroup of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growthfactor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guysfollowing a heart attack, said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor atJefferson.Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 ratsby partially blocking key arteries in their hearts.In 12 of the rats, the researchers injected a placebo. In theother 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, the damagefrom the attack was much less severe. There was about 50 percentless injury with TGF beta than without it.The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring theamount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack.Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heartattack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer. Thus, bymeasuring for the loss of this substance, researchers coulddetermine the amount of heart damage.Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of othersubstances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause bloodvessels to narrow following a heart attack. Narrowed blood vesselscarry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additionalinjury following a heart attack.TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the studypublished in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cellsdamaged by a simulated heart attack.Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer saidhis research team used a substance produced artificially byGenentech, a California biotechnology firm.Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies withTGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attackvictims with the substance is at least a year away.Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part ofThomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.Science, which published the study, is the journal of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science.The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test,which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin,might suggest a new ""risk factor"" for heart attacks. Abouthalf of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attackeach year don't have the known risk factors for heartdisease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking,obesity and high blood pressure. It is unknown whatdistinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those whodon't suffer heart attacks.The blood and urine test is already being done in manycommercial laboratories but for medical conditions other thanheart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the CardiovascularCenter at Cornell University and New York Hospital. ""In ourhands, it cost about $40 and in other labs it may cost thepatient $40 to $80,"" he said. Dr. Laragh pioneered theresearch underlying use of the test, which was developed byhis wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey. The test, which isn'tpatented, is available in kit form to laboratories.The blood portion of the test determines whether thekidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and howactive the chemical is. The release of renin is the firststep in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises bloodpressure. The urine portion of the test tells how much saltis in the bloodstream. A high concentration of salt in theblood also raises pressure.The test is based on the fact that if the saltconcentration in the blood rises, tending to boost bloodpressure, the activity of the renin normally drops to offsetthe effect of the salt.The new experiment was designed to test a theory put forthby Dr. Laragh and his colleagues that the activity of therenin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack. Thetheory has provoked sometimes furious controversy for almost20 years.The Cornell cardiologist has argued that in many peoplewith high blood pressure the activity of the renin in theblood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of saltin the blood. Such ""high renin"" people are at a high risk ofa heart attack. On the other hand, in other patients withhigh blood pressure, the activity of the renin is much lowerthan is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood. These""low renin"" people are at a low risk of heart attack, Dr.Laragh has maintained.In the experiment, blood and urine samples were obtainedat New York City offices and factories from 1,717 worke","AP881115-0113,AP890115-0014,AP900322-0112,AP901003-0006,AP880428-0041,WSJ880603-0129,AP880818-0088,AP880829-0222,AP900705-0149,WSJ910418-0105",,,,,New medical advances reduce the number of heart attacks nationwide.,"The chances of having a heart attack, the number one killer in the United States, have decreased significantly in the last decade. Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

(These volcanoes -- includingMount Lassen in Shasta County, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens inWashington, all in the Cascade Range -- arise where one of the earth's immensecrust plates is slowly diving beneath another.); Pinatubo's last eruption,600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- halfa cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980. Untilvolcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneaththe volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.; Other recentvolcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 andNevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.; If it does have a massive eruption,Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellishavalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.; ""In the worst case, areally big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered"" withglowing ash, Lipman said.; Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing offthe avalanche is fatal. That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.;Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base,Lipman said.; Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash --indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having theirengines stalled by the grit.; So far, the winds have blown ash away fromthe base. But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to beginany day, would send ash directly toward the base.; The volcano's activity-- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rockplumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption isimminent, Lipman said.; The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters onthe volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside.

Thomas told the Judiciary Committeethat ""philosophically, there is nothing that would bother me personally aboutupholding it (the death penalty) in appropriate cases."";After Thomas leftthe hearing room, an American Bar Association evaluation committee told thesenators that his articles in law journals were deficient in presentation,content, scholarship and analysis.;But those limitations were outweighed byhis ""brief but highly satisfactory performance on the Court of Appeals,"" thecommittee said, noting that ""we found only one opinion to criticize and manyto praise.""Her critics see her as more than the supportive spouse who'll accompany herhusband, Clarence, through his Senate confirmation hearings, which beganTuesday and are likely to run through next week.

But others see a different symbolism.;  'Sign of rejection'; ""His marrying a white woman is a sign of his rejection ofthe black community,"" said Russell Adams, chairman of Howard University'sdepartment of Afro-American studies. ""Great justices have had community rootsthat served as a basis for understanding the Constitution.

Dean Kelley, the National Council of Churches'counselor on religious liberty, wrote a critique of Clarence Thomas that wasused as grounds for his organization's opposition to the Supreme Courtnominee. The author did not mention Virginia Thomas in his text but has saidhe was concerned about her involvement in the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), aChicago-based organization that says it educates the public about""destructive"" cults. That involvement, he said, might affect her husband'shandling of religious-liberty cases if he shares her views on the subject.;  During the early '80s, Virginia Thomas enrolled in Lifespring, a self-helpcourse that challenges students to take responsibility for their lives.

It was centered near Hollister, 80 miles southeastof San Francisco in San Benito County.The thing struck just as everyone was going home, said TomMullins, a spokesman for the California Office of EmergencyServices in Sacramento. We've got reports coming in from SanBenito and Santa Clara counties of heavy damage.CBS said the California Highway Patrol reported a J.C.

ThenHugo came along, triggering an effort the agency estimates willcost $42 million  the most ever.When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hitback-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disasterresources and manpower, said Bob Vessey, director of disasterservices in Washington, D.C.A major earthquake rocked northernCalifornia Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San FranciscoBay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 95miles away.Some buildings may have collapsed, said Police Officer D.Collins. There were reports of injuries at Candlestick, where fanswere waiting for the World Series to begin, and the stadium wasevacuated, ABC-TV and Cable News Network reported.The quake, which lasted about 15 seconds, measured 6.5 on theRichter scale, according to seismologists at the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology in Pasadena. The preliminary reading wasfrom the Alaska Tsunami warning system, Caltech said.Televised footage of the bridge showed that a 30-foot section ofthe span's upper deck had collapsed onto the bottom level.Fans at Candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed for about 15seconds. Players from the San Francisco Giants and the OaklandAthletics were on the field and stood around as fans began to leavetheir seats.Buildings in San Francisco swayed several feet.The quake shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles to thenortheast, and was felt as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to theeast.The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity atThe Associated Press' bureau in San Francisco.The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded onseismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increasein magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 timesstronger than one of 6.5.An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slightdamage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a major earthquake, capable ofwidespread heavy damage; 8 is a great quake, capable oftremendous damage.The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before theRichter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richterscale.The major earthquake that struck the SanFrancisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologiststargeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake inNorthern California.A 1988 report by the U.S. Geological Survey placed theprobability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scaleat 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.The high probability is based on several factors, includinglength of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics atthe California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.This is not to say we predicted the earthquake. It just has todo with the probability of an earthquake in this area, Allen said.He noted that the 1988 report, titled Probabilities of LargeEarthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,presented information that was already widely known amongscientists. Allen said this information should have alertedofficials to take preventive steps.Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center saidthe quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. It was centeredin the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded onseismographs. A reading of 6 can cause severe damage. A quake of 7magnitude, a major earthquake, is capable of widespread heavydamage.Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday'squake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings.It's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is acalamitous event. It's something we should therefore be readyfor, Allen said.The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind ofstructures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the LosAngeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of viewfrom this earthquake, he said. What will be important is to seehow the modern structures behaved.Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures thatappeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in theLos Angeles region. In addition, some of the roadways andoverpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of constructionas the Bay Bridge.In some areas of Southern California, there is a higherprobability of a major quake occurring. The highest, the USGS says,is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated SanFrancisco, many scientists have believed the next big one wouldstrike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that italso faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became areality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scalerocked the Bay area.A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the SanAndreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southwardthrough the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described inthe article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S.Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yetwhether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment.The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of SantaCruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco.The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professorChristopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflictingestimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finallyhappened Tuesday.These studies gave various interpretations of how much stressinside the Earth was released by the great San Francisco earthquakeof 1906, which had a magnitude of about 8.3 and killed at least2,500 people.The bigger a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus thelonger it takes for the same size quake to happen again.Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve asmuch stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientistsbelieved. That suggested a bigger quake might happen in the SanFrancisco Bay area sooner than some believed.Others disagreed. Faced with conflicting estimates, theGeological Survey issued a July 1988 report that it saidrepresented a consensus on the debate.The report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihoodof producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years. It said thesouthernmost 20 miles of that segment had a 30 percent chance ofgenerating a magnitude-6.5 quake within 30 years.Tuesday's jolt was centered within those southernmost 20 milesof the fault segment.Clearly, scientists had identified this segment as aparticularly hazardous one, Heaton said. There was some debateabout the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake.The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed veryfew people in a region that was then sparsely populated.Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fallvictim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report castdoubt on this assumption.Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next bigone  a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake  could kill3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000people in the Bay Area.As bad as Tuesday's quake was, it was not a 1906 earthquake,Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming. Thequestion is when, Peck said.","AP891017-0199,AP891019-0037,LA102089-0177,AP891017-0195,LA101889-0066,LA101889-0108,LA102389-0075,LA102089-0172,AP891017-0204,AP891018-0084","6.9 earthquake rocked Northern California October 17, 1989, at predicted epicenter","A 6.9 earthquake rocked Northern California on October 17, 1989, at a predicted epicenter.

46,d079a,"Hurricane Gilbert weakened to atropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threwtornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacueesalong the Texas-Mexico border.At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 lefthomeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mphwind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulfof Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico. One person diedtoday in Texas after being injured in a tornado.But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustainedwinds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, andforecasters said the eye had all but disappeared. However, theywarned of continued danger from flash flooding inland.Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as itproceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northernMexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the NationalHurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.Winds were still weakening as the storm moved west-northwest at12 mph, he said.Gulf Coast residents expressed relief that the storm, whichearlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the WesternHemisphere, pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering aspate of tornadoes.We're thankful, said Betty Turner, mayor of Corpus Christi.What could have been one of the most deadly storms in historyappears to have missed us.Corpus Christi residents who evacuated were eager to return, butTurner said, We're saying don't do it because of the flooding.At least a dozen tornadoes peppered southern Texas today,following 14 on Friday, killing one woman, striking a hospitalcomplex, military bases and a mobile home park, authorities said.Some injuries were reported.At 6 a.m. CDT, the center of the storm was in northern Mexiconear latitude 25.0 degrees north and longitude 99.8 west, or about150 miles southwest of Brownsville, located at the southernmost tipof Texas.Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grandevalley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as ahuge rain-making machine, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist atthe National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great, Zimmersaid. Rainfall as high as 10 to 15 inches  maybe even 20 inches is expected.By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valleyand end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather,forecasters said.The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas,Zimmer said.Gilbert, responsible for billions of dollars in damage during aweeklong rampage across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, barreledashore Friday afternoon in Tamaulipas state, a sparsely populatedarea of Mexico about 120 miles south of Brownsville.The eye passed over Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, two smallvillages a few miles north of La Pesca, Mexico, where ocean tidescoursed over two miles of flatlands and into the town.We presume (the Mexican villages) are getting a good poundingfrom 120 mph winds, Zimmer said Friday.Thousands of people evacuated in areas of northeastern Mexico,including the entire beach area of Matamoros, a city of 280,000just across the border.To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatanstate and 10,000 more were homeless in Campeche, on the west coastof the peninsula, the government news agency Notimex said. Thestorm had left more than 500,000 homeless in Jamaica earlier in theweek.In Texas, heavy rains fell on Brownsville, with gusts up to 82mph recorded at nearby Padre Island, but the vulnerable coastalarea escaped the worst of the storm.Police in nearby Harlingen said the windows of 20 to 30 cars ina parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado. Low-lyingcoastal roads were closed by high water.About 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in afour-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville, saidAmerican Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman. When the eye of thestorm passed to the south, evacuees were eager to return to theirhomes.We're going home. We think everything is going to be OK,Philip Gibbons said Friday night, leaving a Brownsville shelterinto a downpour. We don't think it's going to get bad and therewas no need to stay here anymore.Others, however, were more cautious.I wouldn't want to go home and then have my family hurt by atornado, said Praxedis Lindsey, 25, of Brownsville, who was at ashelter with his pregnant wife and son.Elsewhere, most of the estimated 25,000 people evacuated insouthern Louisiana and 20,000 in the island city of Galveston wereallowed to return home Friday.In Alabama, tornadoes were reported in seven counties, uprootingtrees but causing no major damage or injuries.One Texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane. A3-year-old boy fell from his family's shrimp boat when they movedthe vessel for safe mooring, officials said.Gilbert, an extremely dangerous hurricane and one of thestrongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's YucatanPeninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the DominicanRepublic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in theDominican Republic, civil defense officials said. Six people diedand 60,000 were left homeless in Jamaica on Monday, officials theresaid.Prime Minister Edward Seaga said the hurricane swept the fulllength of Jamaica, leaving a trail of wreckage behind it.It will take us some time before we can assess the full damagewithout any doubt, Seaga said in a statement. But I have nodoubt that this going to be the worst disaster that we haveexperienced in our modern history.Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and thedeath toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage andcasualty reports.The hurricane, traveling westward across the Caribbean Sea, wasupgraded Tuesday to a Category 5, the strongest and deadliest typeof hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in CoralGables, Fla., described Gilbert as a great hurricane ... in thetop 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity, size anddestructive potential.Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States  a1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida, and HurricaneCamille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed256 people.The people who need to be concerned now are those people overon the Yucatan Peninsula  Cancun, Cozumel, that whole area,Sheets said.Mexico's news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated inthe Yucatan resorts of Cancun and Cozumel Island.They gave no figures on the numer of evacuees, but said peoplein Cancun were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center,about 6 miles away.Cozumel is south of Cancun and the reports said hotel guestsalso were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline.Mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morninghours Wednesday.At midnight EDT the U.S. National Weather Service said Gilbertwas centered near latitude 19.9 north, longitude 84.8 west, orabout 150 miles east-southeast of Cozumel.It said Gilbert was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph withmaximum sustained winds of 175 mph. The center said tropicalstorm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles to the north and200 miles to the south of the center.People in the warned areas should have completed all possiblepreparations for this extremely dangerous hurricane, it said.The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm onrecord in terms of barometric pressure. It said by 8 p.m. EDT itwas measured at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recordedfor the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the WesternHemisphere, said forecaster Mark Zimmer.There is very serious flooding in the Cayman Islands, ErinaNichols, a tourism official in Miami, said Tuesday after speakingwith residents of the islands. The Run Point (community) istaking a real beating.The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the CaymanIslands, a British dependency of 23,000 people that was expecting12-foot tides.Warren Chase, an amateur radio operator in Fort Myers, Fla.,said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboardmissing near the Cayman Islands.Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in theGulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.in Lafayette, La., said his company's 18 helipads were working atfull capacity to evacuate about 10,000 oil rigs in the Gulf ofMexico.The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said 40,000 people, many ofthem foreign vacationers and students, were evacuated Tuesday fromthe Isle of Youth off the southwestern coast as the hurricanepassed 200 miles to the south.In New York City, a ham radio operator who was monitoringamateur radio communications in Jamaica said Tuesday, Kingston isdevastated, Montego Bay is hit hard and Ocho Rios is flooded.The operator, Norm Chwat, an officer with the American Red CrossRadio Club, said therth coast had been wrecked by thehurricane.Herb Schoenbaum, a radio ham operator in the Virgin Islands,said he spoke Tuesday with Dave Porter, an American staying in theWyndham Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay. Porter reported that thehotel `peeled apart like a banana' when the force of HurricaneGilbert hit last night, Schoenbaum said.This morning he says there is just nothing left. Boats thatwere on the beach, the little rental Sailfishes or Sunfishes, weredriven into cars like spears  power lines down, almost every treein the area is on the ground.Schoenbaum said Porter told him people who were trying to enterthe hotel on their hands and knees at the height of the storm wereswept into the ocean.Glenn Baxter of Belgrade Lakes, Me., said he spoke with a hamoperator in Jamaica who told him the roof of a hospital inMandeville ripped off and the hospital has caved in. And that isthe worst horror show that I've heard about because that wouldimply that a lot of people could have been hurt.The Jamaican consulate in Miami said today it had n immediateinformation on the extent of damages or casualties.Jamaica was still out of contact with the rest of the world bytelephone.Roger Myers, southern regional spokesman for the FederalAviation Administration in Atlanta, said both internationalairports in Jamaica are closed. We've been told the governmenthas asked commercial radio stations to remain silent so RadioJamaica can broadcast information, Myers said.Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico. In the Dominican Republic, all domestic flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled. Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island they share, and headed west. ""It's still gaining strength. It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time,"" said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. At 3 p.m. EDT, the center of the hurricane was about 100 miles south of the Dominican Republic and 425 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica. The hurricane was moving west at about 15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for the next 24 hours. Forecasters said the hurricane's track would take it about 50 miles south of southwestern Haiti. The hurricane center said small craft in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should remain in port until conditions improve. The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would get as much as 10 inches of rain yesterday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti last night and tonight. Hurricane warnings were issued for the south coast of Haiti and Cuba by their respective governments. In Jamaica, the government issued a hurricane watch for the entire island. Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. In Puerto Rico, besides tearing off several roofs, the storm caused coastal flooding and brought down power lines and trees along roads and highways in the west and southwestern regions. Three people were injured in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, when a tree fell on their vehicle as they traveled along Route 97, police reported. Four policemen stationed on Mona Island, between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, were stranded as a result of the weather.Hurricane Gilbert swepttoward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alertedits heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavyrains and high seas.The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustainedwinds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph.There is no need for alarm, Civil Defense Director EugenioCabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday.Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closelyfollow Gilbert's movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in theprovince, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 mileswest of Santo Domingo.Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean andstrengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The NationalHurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday atlatitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south ofPonce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo.The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, saidGilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a broad area ofcloudiness and heavy weather rotating around the center of thestorm.The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Ricoand the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastalflooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to PuertoRico's south coast. There were no reports of casualties.San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gustsSaturday, but they subsided during the night.On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropicalstorm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mphwinds and sheets of rain.Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic stormseason, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimalhurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast lastmonth.The most intense hurricane on recordsurged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsulawith 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts andforcing tens of thousands to flee.Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicanshomeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the stormwas beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved towardthe U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.The storm was headed west northwest, said National HurricaneCenter director Bob Sheets. It was moving at 15 mph and dumping upto 10 inches of rain.The area that we have the most likely possibility that thishurricane will make landfall is in the northern part of Mexico orthe southeastern, southern part of Texas, he said.At 3 p.m. today, the center of the storm was near latitude 22.3north and longitude 92.9 west, or about 380 miles southeast ofBrownsville, Texas, the National Weather Service said.Brownsville was given a 21 percent probability of being hit,though a hurricane watch was in effect along the entire Texas coastas well as the northeastern Mexican coast from Tampico.Earlier this week the storm struck the Carribean, ravagingJamaica, the Dominican Repubic, the Cayman Islands and Haiti,killing at least 19 in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic.Haiti declared a state of emergency across its southernpeninsula, where at least 10 hurricane-related deaths have beenreported.The storm, about 450 miles wide, hit the Yucatan coast at dawnWednesday, thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees,knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephonelines.Mexican officials reported at least seven injuries. There wereno reports of deaths.Gilbert battered the provincial capital of Merida and the gulfport cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen,closing airports and roads and knocking out communications andpower and innundating streets and highways.About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso andother coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry inMexico City said by telephone today. Hundreds of homes weredestroyed, he said.The ministry said the storm seriously damaged the luxury hotelzone in the resort of Cancun and destroyed about a quarter of thehomes on the nearby island of Cozumel. Ham radio operators inMexico City also told The Associated Press they had reports ofmassive damage to several hotels.Authorities were particularly concerned about the people trappedon another resort island just off Cancun, tiny Isla Mujeres.A navy spokesman in Mexico City said he had no word on theplight of an estimated 15,000 people stranded there. Three ferrieslinking the island with the mainland were lost in the storm, butthere were no reports of casualties.In Campeche, boats were driven onto the street running along thewaterfront, Ramon Castillo, a night watchman at the newspaperNovedades of Campeche, said in a telephone interview.There is no light, there is no radio, there is nothing. Thereis much damage. The whole city is flooded, he said.Sheets said the hurricane was expected to hit land midday Fridayand that its sustained winds would today certainly increase to130, 140 miles per hour.It's going to have an impact over a fairly large area,Sheets said on CBS-TV's This Morning.Those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairlytight close to the center. But the impacts are going to be feltover most of the Texas area.The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm onrecord in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.31inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricanethat devastated the Florida Keys.In the Yucatan state capital of Merida, the storm's 160 mphwinds destroyed nearly all the thatched houses in one district,uprooted trees, road signs and cut off water supplies, saidGonzalez Correa, news editor of Novedades.A spokeswoman with the National Civil Defense System in MexicoCity said at least 20,000 people had flocked to Merida from coastalareas.Civil defense officials said 6,000 tourists left beachsidemotels and 30,000 local people also sought temporary shelter. U.S.consular officials said they did not know how many tourists were inCancun, which receives about 50,000 visitors per month.The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appearedto have hit Jamaica the hardest. That island nation's primeminister, Edward Seaga, said Wednesday that it destroyed about100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $8billion.Earlier Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm,the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms havemaximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can causecatastrophic damage.By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded itto a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by this morning.Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States  the1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille,which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256people.With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the mostintense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center,reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometricpressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT onTuesday. Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the WesternHemisphere, Zimmer said. The previous record low pressure of26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struckthe Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, hesaid.With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and200 miles south of the hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one ofthe largest. But because the circumference of a hurricane changesso often during its course, no records are kept on their overallsize, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold tohurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probablyabout half that size, Moore said.Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemispheresince weather officials began keeping detailed records. The otherswere the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, whichbulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-footwave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disasterin U.S. history, however. That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8and killed more than 6,000 people.Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometricpressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18feet.The storm surge  a great dome of water that follows the eye ofthe hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane centerwas forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs andwindows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane, Zimmersaid. The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist airin the center. If the atmospheric conditions in general allow thiswarm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, thenyou can have a severe hurricane.Category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90. Theweakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent ariver raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded withevacuees from Matamoros, police said today.The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140miles inland from Matamoros.At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescuemission around midnight, a judicial police officer said. Severalbuses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and morewere feared drowned.The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said earlytoday it had been raining for more than 24 hours.A trailer truck also slid into the Santa Catarina river in thedriving rain and its two occupants were missing, the localnewspaper El Norte said.Recreational areas with soccer fields, basketball courts, tenniscourts and jogging trails have been built along the river in thelast few years.Monterrey is a major northern industrial center and the capitalof Nuevo Leon state. The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.The storm slammed into Mexico for the second time in a weekFriday afternoon. The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mphwinds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in asparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas,weather reports said.Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floodsand mudslides after it barreled into Mexico. Earlier in the week,Gilbert killed at least 29 and left 300,000 people homeless in theYucatan Peninsula.The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one inTexas, 39 in Mexico, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in theDominican Republic and eight in Honduras. However, the death tollis expected to rise.In Matamoros just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, thestorm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tinshack homes on the evacuated beachfront. About 5,000 people wereevacuated inland.Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around Brownsville.Much of the Yucatan Peninsula remained without communications andsupplies today.At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilbert's center was located near latitude25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest ofBrownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the NationalHurricane Center in Florida.Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and thestorm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours.The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying thestorm with up to 20 inches locally. Flash floods were likely, itsaid.The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and wasexpected to follow that track through midday today before turninggradually to the northwest, forecasters said.In Matamoros, officials said the worst part of the stormappeared to have passed. Up to now the damages are not consideredvery grave, said Jose Inez Gonzalez, a Matamoros governmentspokesman.Officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of peoplein shelters and rged them to stay put until the storm ended.Gilbert hit Soto la Marina, a town of 8,000 people 20 milesinland from La Pesca on late Friday, its mayor told The AssociatedPress by telephone.There is considerable material damage to the town. It is stillraining very hard, said Mayor Ruben Hinojosa Cortina. We willjust have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey thesituation.Hinojosa Cortina said about 3,000 refugees from La Pesca weresheltered in Soto la Marina but other coastal residents had notbeen evacuated or decided to ride out the storm.The Sierra de Tamaulipas, a small mountain range betweenMonterrey and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strength,said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center.Zimmer expected the last of hurricane-force winds today. But hepredicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into coolermountain air, possibly causing flash floods and mudslides.The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food,medicines and water to Cancun, Cozumel and other disaster sites inthe Yucatan.In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinkingwater, electrical power, gasoline and communications sinceWednesday.Thousands of coastal residents fromMexico to Louisiana fled to higher ground Thursday as fierceHurricane Gilbert sent the first of its storms against Texas afterthrashing the Yucatan Peninsula.This is a killer storm, said Gordon Guthrie, director of theFlorida Division of Emergency of Management. I feel sorry foranybody wherever this hits.The death toll from the storm's onslaught through the Caribbeanislands and the Yucatan was at least 47, and damage estimatesreached $8 billion. Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga declared aone-month public emergency.By late evening, a torrential rain was falling in Brownsville.At 11 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 22.8 north,longitude 94.4 west, or about 275 miles southeast of Brownsville,moving west-northwest between 12 and 15 mph, with maximum sustainedwinds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 5- to 10-inch rainfall,according to the National Weather Service.If this motion continues, the center of the hurricane willcross the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Friday evening,the weather service said. If a northwest turn should occur, thelandfall could be further up the Texas coast.The weather service issued a hurricane warning for Mexico'snorthern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coastfrom Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 250,000-residentCorpus Christi. A hurricane watch remained in effect for theremainder of the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to PortArthur near the Louisiana border.The weather service said warnings might be extended northward,depending on the path of the 450-mile wide storm.Texas Gov. Bill Clements sent National Guard units to Alice,McAllen and Corpus Christi, the first such deployment for thehurricane, to assist in communications and rescue duties.Clements also issued an emergency proclamation allowing localauthorities to suspend laws to preserve the health, safety andwelfare of the public, including such things as the direction oftravel on highways.Grocery stores ran low on bottled water, batteries, canned tunaand bread as people laid in supplies. Homeowners covered windowsand doors with plywood and shatter-proofing hurricane tape.Offshore oil workers left their rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.On Galveston Island, City Manager Doug Matthews recommendedThursday evening that the city's 62,000 residents start evacuating.We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock weare recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we cannotwait until the morning to make that decision, Matthews said,adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45to limit access to the island.In Brownsville, Texas' southernmost city, winds began to pick uparound noon under overcast skies. Police said they were askingresidents to consider evacuating, but were not ordering it.We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are yougoing to move 100,000 people? said Sgt. Dean Poos.A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company wasdoubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate thosefleeing the storm.Lorena Curry, who has lived in Brownsville since 1935, said sheplans to ride out the storm. I've been through them before. I'mgoing to stick around at my home. But she added, I could getalong without a hurricane very well.Gilbert surged into the gulf after battering the YucatanPeninsula in Mexico with 160 mph winds, forcing tens of thousandsto flee.After crossing the peninsula, Gilbert's winds weakened to 120mph, but forecasters predicted the storm would intensify again asit moves over open water.The shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking placearound the hurricane itself is getting better organized, morevigorous, so we think it's starting to strengthen, said BobSheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.Sheets said the hurricane's sustained winds would certainlyincrease to 130, 140 miles per hour.In the coastal resort of South Padre Island, about 25 milessoutheast of Brownsville, the mayor ordered its 1,000 residents toevacuate.We can't force them to leave, but it doesn't make any sense tostay, said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr., adding that water andelectricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon.Tropical storm force winds, at least 39 mph, extended outward upto 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center.The storm's first landfall earlier this week left at least 26people dead in Jamaica, five in the Dominican Republic, 10 in Haitiand the six in Mexico.

47,d071f,"Walk. Sit. Stay. Roll over. Go to court. Such is the life of one German short-haired pointer, a show dog bearing the name CH. Robin Crest Lorien Corniche. Cory, as he is called for short, isn't any run-of-the-litter critter. The ""CH."" in his name stands for champion. He has won 245 show awards as Best of Breed and 19 awards as Best in Show. Basically, his problem comes from serving more than one master. One of the dog's three owners thinks the kennel-club world has seen enough of Cory, who is four years old. The other two owners think he has plenty of prizes still ahead. In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News). In the suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Mr. Attalla says, ""Cory has achieved the pinnacle of success . . . and any further competition would only diminish what he has accomplished."" Mr. Attalla claims that his work with Cory is no gravy train. In the suit, he says that under the owners' agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show -- or to retire -- Cory. So far, Mr. Attalla says, he's spent over $125,000, the amount sought in damages. In return, he is entitled to all ribbons and awards. The Remondis are in charge of caring for the dog. Despite the retirement, the suit says, the Remondis showed Cory twice recently. (He placed fourth and then didn't place at all.) For now, a judge's order temporarily bars them from further shows. In a memo filed in court, Mr. Remondi claims that Mr. Attalla retired the dog ""simply and solely to better"" the chances that Mr. Attalla's agent would win with a rival Rover. The Remondis also say Mr. Attalla has bought a Rottweiler to show in another category and doesn't want to spend money on both Cory and the other dog. They claim that Mr. Attalla has breached the pact by not paying certain expenses. Stud fees are also at issue. The Remondis argue that the retirement ""fraudulently"" deprives them of their opportunity to show Cory, a dog who they assert ""is in the best condition of his life.""McFadden and his wife, Taffe, run their dog handling business in Campbelland do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings.

""I dreamedthat he came back to life,"" said Wegman, who spent three years living withouta dog. ""It was kind of liberating, the years I didn't have a dog.""; In1984, however, he got another Weimaraner, which was stolen. Yet another dogdied of Parvo, a virus. In 1985, he got Fay Ray, who is now a familiar facenot only among artists but among children who watch ""Sesame Street.""; As abreed, Weimaraners combine ""a lap-dog sensibility with a hunting capability,""the artist said.

""It's the highest in protein."" he said. He oftenadds a spoonful of plain yogurt or cottage cheese. The dogs eat again at 6p.m.; The house is designed for both human and canine comfort. There isnowhere that Wegman goes that the dogs do not. The yard is a run of dirt andconcrete.

48,d078b,"Spike Lee may have been wearing aGeorgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he got a far warmerreception from Syracuse University students than he did fromAcademy Award voters.In a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday, Leeshrugged off the academy's icy treatment of his latest movie, Dothe Right Thing, and blamed it on generational politics.The 1989 film, widely hailed by critics, received only twoAcademy Award nominations, and isn't being considered for bestpicture or best director.The academy's membership consists mainly of old people, the32-year-old Lee said. He said they were a lot more comfortablewith the black chauffeur in `Driving Miss Daisy' than with theangry characters in his film.I still feel we made the best film of the year, he said.Asked if racism might have been involved in the academynominations, Lee replied, Racism's involved in everything.Despite the cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse students welcomed himas one of their own.He's an African-American, one of the first ones to make it (asa producer and director), and he's addressing the issues andconcerns affecting our community, Syracuse senior Deron Harrissaid. That's why we're so proud of him.What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, CaryGrant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common? Theyhave never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements.Such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidenceof the unfairness of Hollywood's highest prize. Oscar's 60-yearhistory is filled with examples of the film world's highestachievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Artsand Sciences.The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movieBroadcast News was nominated though he wasn't, and Spielbergwho was left out in the cold with his Empire of the Sun.Although Broadcast News won seven major nominations,including best picture and three acting categories, Brooks wasstrangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch.Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without itsdirector at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favoredBroadcast News to be a big winner at the awards ceremony onApril 11 have been significantly reduced.Brooks did better in 1984 when his Terms of Endearment tookthe lion's share of Oscars, including best picture and director.Spielberg's Empire of the Sun won six nominations this year,none of them major and none for director. Two years ago, TheColor Purple received 11 nominations but not for him as director.The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.I'm floored by this, Spielberg said upon receiving his DGAaward. This is the last thing I expected to happen. ... If someof you are making a statement  thank God  I thank you for that.Why the Spielberg slight? Some observers cite the fact that only257 directors nominate for the Academy Awards, and many areveterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films arethe biggest moneymakers in history (Jaws, E.T., Raidersof the Lost Ark).The Academy appeared to make amends last year by presentingSpielberg with the Irving Thalberg award for consistently highquality of production. There was no mention of the fact thatSpielberg is primarily a director, not a producer.The Thalberg award has come in handy to acknowledge giants whowere overlooked for individual awards. The recipients have includedCecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergmanand Mervyn Leroy.The honorary award has also proved useful to salve the Academy'sconscience. Charlie Chaplin received one at the first AcademyAwards for his creation of The Circus and again at the 44thawards for the incalculable effect he has had in making motionpictures the art form of this century.Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch,Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, MauriceChevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G.Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are others whohave received honorary awards.Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected to win anAcademy Award. I'd have to blacken my teeth first, he quipped,alluding to the Academy's fondness for actors who portray bums anddowntrodden characters.Alfred Hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why hefailed to win an Oscar: I suppose it was a matter ofcarelessness.The overlooking of classic films and the industry's mosttalented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute.For example, Citizen Kane, which customarily places No. 1 onpolls of the greatest American films, was nominated in 1941 forbest picture (there were 10 nominees in those days), for OrsonWelles' performance, direction and co-scripting with HermanMankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, plus art direction, sound,music and editing.The only Oscar for Citizen Kane was for the script. HowGreen Was My Valley was named best picture.Billy Wilder's classic comedy, Some Like It Hot, failed tobe nominated as best picture, as did Chaplin's Modern Times,Hawks' Red River and Woody Allen's Manhattan.Oh, well. Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line from SomeLike It Hot: Nobody's perfect.The Oscar statuette, one of the mostrecognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyrightprotection, a federal judge has ruled.The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain,U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling releasedThursday.The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion PictureArts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer ofan employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling comes as a shockto me. The academy said it would appeal.The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alikemade by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, dilutedthe academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like theOscar, just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of asword. It had a gold finish similar to the Oscar, and stood on acircular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base.Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy isvery similar to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy'slegal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the publicdomain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the CopyrightAct of 1976.The film industry's top award was distributed from the firstceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the c mark indicatinga copyright.The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honoraryaward but also was used to promote the film industry, and thereforedid not have a limited purpose, as required by the copyrightact.The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuetteand that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscarand the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.We are surprised that the court would base its decision onevents which occurred half a century ago, overlooking themeticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrityof its institutional symbol for decades, Malden said in astatement.Free enterprise has collided with the AcademyAwards, and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces.With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $10,000and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones,the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences isscrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished byHollywood hucksterism.If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, yourisk having your trademark become public domain, said Bruce Davis,the Academy's executive administrator, in explaining the lawsuitsthe organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk ofelectroplated pewter.But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism,this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandisingwrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to theOscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammedwith Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditoriumand the celebrities tumble out, the Coke logo will be on display infront of an audience that includes millions around the world.It seemed like a good marketing opportunity, said Coca-Colaspokesman Ira Gleser. The Academy approached our local bottler inLos Angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people.But even as the Academy embraces this new intrusion ofmerchandising, it has lashed out at whatever else it considers ablemishing of the Oscar name.When MGM-UA, the distributor of Rain Man, published newspaperadvertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before thenominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harshstatement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble. After the adsappeared, Rain Man collected nine nominations.We regard this as a serious matter, and we have communicatedour concern, said Richard Kahn, president of the Academy.For nearly 50 years, the Academy has maintained strict securityaround both the nominations and the award winners. It also hasenvisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon.So auctioning the Oscar has greatly distressed the Academy.The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthlyentertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in thepast year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's AnAmerican in Paris ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for1954's On the Waterfront ($13,000) and the black and whiteinterior decoration Oscar for 1941's How Green Was My Valley($17,715).None were sold by the original recipients; heirs or friends whohad later received the trophies put them on the block.When Malcolm Willits, the book store's owner, announced that hewould hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy forAround the World in 80 Days, the Academy said enough, initiatinga court action that, for now, has blocked any future trophy sales.The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winnersmandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offeringthem to the Academy for a nominal fee.But now that the word is out that these awards are worth$10,000 to $50,000, people are reluctant to sell them back to theAcademy for $10, Willits said.The Academy has created something of great value here. This isthe most famous award in the world  the most instantly recognizableaward. The Nobel Prize might be a greater honor, but people knowmore about what an Academy Award looks like.And they're very limited, too. There's not too many of themaround. ... Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have a movie poster inyour living room unless you were a college student. Now, you can gointo Beverly Hills homes and there's a movie poster, and the darnthing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.When the Academy won a court order temporarily blocking futureauctions, Willits decided to sell his store. It seemed to be thefinal straw. I don't like lawsuits, he said. I'm getting olderand I'd like to write movie scripts.Yet the Academy has lost its most recent attempt to save itstrophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought againstthe Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 in aCalifornia federal court.The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed andbuilt by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was practicallyidentical to the Oscar. The court found otherwise.The motion picture industry's most covetedaward, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuetteshave been produced so far.Weighing 8{ pounds and standing 13{ inches tall, Oscar wascreated by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios art director Cedric Gibbons,who went on to win 11 of the trophies.Oscar, manufactured by the R.S. Owens Co., Chicago, is made ofBritannia metal, copper plate, nickel plate and gold plate. From1942 to 1944, the trophy was made of plaster, but winners werelater presented with the real thing.According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,the only engraving mistake was in 1938 when the best actor trophygiven to Spencer Tracy for Boy's Town read: Best Actor: DickTracy.The Academy holds all the rights on the statue and reservesthe right to buy back an Oscar before someone takes it to a pawnshop, said Academy spokesman Bob Werden.The most-nominated film was All About Eve in 1950. It got 14nominations. Ben-Hur in 1959 was the most-awarded film with 11,and Walt Disney was the most-awarded person with 32.Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as filmstudios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of MotionPicture Arts and Sciences.And with the flood of Oscar vote enticements  from free coffeemugs to complimentary buffet dinners  Academy members areacknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee, inviolation of the rules. Secretaries, spouses and friends, severalAcademy members say, are marking ballots in what is supposed to bethe entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition.It's like a local election of judges, said Academy memberHarry Clein, who said he's witnessed team voting. A lot of peopledon't know who the candidates are. So they take a look at who'saround them and see what the consensus is.As far as elections go, it's not bad. But I've never beenthrough an election in Argentina.Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accountingfirm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee thatAcademy members have actually filled out their own ballots.All we know is that a properly numbered ballot has beenreturned, he said. Members are on the honor system to fill outthe ballot themselves.More than 4,600 members were given ballots this year for the 61stAnnual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from theShrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Academy members vote on their areaof specialty. The Academy's actors branch, for example, is the onlygroup to select nominees in the four acting categories.Since the voting is done secretly  members do not sign theirballots  the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numericcontrol number, Lyle said. Ballots are invalidated only if there ismore than one vote in a given category, and only the votes in thatspecific category are not tallied, he said.Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and allspecialized categories are handled by select branches and committeescomposed of Academy members.All voting members of the Academy can participate in the bestpicture nominations and may vote for the final awards in allcategories. Winners for best documentary feature, best animatedshort film and best live-action short film are chosen by only thosemembers who have seen all the nominees.Academy constituent Julian Blaustein said that most of hiscolleagues take the voting very seriously. I don't even vote (in acategory) if I'm not familiar with the pictures in that category.... And I've never told someone to vote for a film, even when I'vedone some of them.Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken,speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman. Although you'reasked to vote in the nominations for five pictures, I think a lot ofpeople figure out that they have a better chance if they just votefor their own picture and leave the other four blank, he said.Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscarvictory have on a film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising thata certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars.The Last Emperor took in $18.9 million, close to half thefilm's gross, after it won last year's best picture trophy. Morethan 70 percent of the revenues generated by 1986's best picture,Platoon, came after the film was nominated. On average, a bestpicture award is worth about $20 million these days.A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio,therefore, can be a good investment. In the case of this year'sawards, a flurry of Academy-oriented newspaper advertisements,banquets, complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five latereleases appears to have been remarkably successful.This year, all best picture nominees and the large majority oftop acting nominees came from movies released in December: TheAccidental Tourist, Dangerous Liaisons, Rain Man andWorking Girl were all released after Dec. 16.While these five movies might be good, the nearly completeexclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted thestudios' mastery of Oscar marketing.I think the Academy Awards are crap, said Terry Gilliam,director of Brazil and the current The Adventures of BaronMunchausen.It's about selling films is all it's about, he said. It'sone more way of flogging some films. When `Brazil' got nominated (in1986), they asked me to be a member of the Academy. And I wouldn'tjoin. I just don't want to be a part of that at all.And at least one prominent Academy member, director Carl Reiner,says that the manipulation of Oscar voters has reached new depths.Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag votes forSigourney Weaver, a best actress nominee for Gorillas in theMist, could lead him to vote against the film.I have in my house more color reproductions of Sigourney Weaverand a beautiful gorilla than I need, Reiner said of promotionalmaterial sent to his home. We've got to tell the Academy to stopthis advertising. I'm getting turned off on the pictures I like.HOLLYWOOD (AP)  Like all great contests, the annual AcademyAwards ceremony has generated a wealth of statistics and triviaover its 60 years of existence, all carefully chronicled by Oscarhistorians.Here, courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts andSciences, are 20 questions about Oscar:1.

49,d072f,"Beverly Sills, Lauren Bacall, Betty Comdenand Phyllis Newman are among performers who will sing, act and makeguest appearances at a birthday bash in August for conductorLeonard Bernstein.The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a benefitconcert scheduled for the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, toraise money for the Tanglewood Music Center, where Bernstein gothis conducting start.Sills will be host. Performances will include the BostonSymphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops Orchestra and the TanglewoodFestival Chorus under the direction of some of the many conductorswhose careers have been guided by Bernstein.Bacall and soprano Barbara Hendricks will perform a movementfrom Bernstein's Symphony No. 3, Kaddish. Violin soloist Midoriwill play two movements from his Serenade.The concert will celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments inpopular music with excerpts from West Side Story, On theTown and others. Dame Gwyneth Jones and Frederica von Stade willbe among those performing highlights from Fidelio, Tristanund Isolde and other works to honor Bernstein's landmark operarecordings.Tickets start at $20 for a spot on the lawn and run up to $5,000for benefactors, who get a seat in the open-air auditorium.Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in Augustwas marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall withthe New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphantconducting debut there with the orchestra.And of course, Monday night's program consisted of threeBernstein compositions that were played shimmeringly well. As wellit should: It was the 1,215th time Bernstein conducted the orchestra.On Nov. 14, 1943, Bernstein, the Philharmonic's then-assistantconductor, filled for an ailing Bruno Walter on such short noticethere was no rehearsal. The concert was broadcast nationally onradio. And there was such acclaim that Bernstein, who had never ledthe orchestra in concert until that day, was catapulted to fame, atage 25.At intermission, Mrs. Artur Rodzinski, whose late husband was thePhilharmonic music's director in 1943 and hired Bernstein as hisassistant, was introduced from a box.Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in the Philharmonic thatSunday, is still a member and was playing on Monday night. Eightothers who also were members in 1943  violinist Louis Fishzohn,oboist Albert Goltzer, timpanist Saul Goodman, bassist Homer Mensch,cellist Martin Ormandy, assistant concertmaster Michael Rosenker,and trumpeters James Smith and William Vacchiano  went on stage.Bernstein gave bear hugs to all nine.I feel older than all of them, said Bernstein.Bernstein was given a silver box engraved with a reproduction ofMonday evening's program cover  a caricature of him, with juttingchin, bright eye, flowing hair and baton, and reading with loveand thanks of the Philharmonic family to Lennie.Will this birthday never end?, he told the audience.Monday's concert began with Bernstein's Chichester Psalms,with the splendid Westminster Symphonic Choir. Todd Caruso, a memberof the American Boychoir whose voice is high, pure and moving, sangthe solo part.Violinist Gidon Kremer, a native of the Latvian town of Riga inthe Soviet Union, was soloist in Serenade for Violin, StringOrchestra, Harp and Percussion. Kremer's sound isn't warm but histechnique is breathtaking.Pianist Krystian Zimerman, who was born in Zabrze, Poland, oftenperforms with Bernstein in Europe. He was the respectful andthoroughly engaged soloist in the final work on the program,Bernstein's Symphony No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra, subtitledThe Age of Anxiety after W.H. Auden's poem.All the performers donated their services, with proceedsbenefiting the Philharmonic's efforts on behalf of Americanconductors.For the New York Philharmonic, it was supposedto be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich. The fates made it anight of Leonard Bernstein.The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74orchestras. But this was HIS orchestra, and the musicians came topay tribute to THEIR laureate conductor, who led them through 1,244concerts during his 47-year association with the Philharmonic.They let his music do the talking.Tonight's concert is not an evening in which we want to dwellon the passing of a giant, but rather what he has left us, guestconductor Leonard Slatkin told the audience at Avery Fisher Hall onThursday night.So four nights after Bernstein's death at age 72, Beethoven'sViolin Concerto became Bernstein's Serenade for Solo Violin,String Orchestra, Harp and Percussion (1954); Shostakovich'sSymphony No. 4 became Bernstein's Symphony No. 1(Jeremiah), written in 1942.Also added were his Chichester Psalms (1965) and hisoverture to Candide (1956). The substitute Bernstein programwas being repeated Friday night, Saturday and Tuesday.It was an extraordinary concert.There weren't many smiling faces among the audience ormusicians. Slatkin's brief introductory comments, followed by thewhimsical Candide, broke some of the tension.Then came the eclectic Serenade, which Bernstein's programnotes says is supposed to be based on Plato's Symposium. Itbegins with a lyrical praise of the Eros, the god of love. Thepiece is sometimes jocular, sometimes melancholy, sometimesassaulting and sometimes hedonistic. It ends in drunken revelry, anintrusion of jazz - as if Bernstein was looking down from heavenand telling the audience, It's O.K. to smile tonight.The soloist - concertmaster Glenn Dicterow - played with muchagility, especially through the difficult double stops andespecially considering the lack of preparation time.The mourning returned after intermission, but not withoutoptimism.Jeremiah begins with suspenseful strings, followed by acantorial French horn, a melodic return to the strings and then aprophetic blaring of brass. The second movement continues thepoint-counterpoint of brass versus strings (Jeremiah versus thecorrupt priests, with Nebuchadnezzar looming on the horizon). Inthe third movement, Jerusalem has fallen to the Babylonian king.Judea is exiled. Jeremiah weeps.How she sits desolate -The city once so full of people -She is become as a widow.During her chanting of the prophet's Lamentations,mezzo-soprano Wendy White had to wipe a tear from her eye. S didmembers of the audience.Last on the program was another Hebraic elegy, ChichesterPsalms. The New York Choral Artists and a boy soloist joined theorchestra.Two harpists dominated the center of the crowded stage.Awake, psaltery and harp! the choir begins in Hebrew.I will rouse the dawn.In the second movement an angelic 8th-grader, Evan Weber, singsKing David's 23rd Psalm, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall notwant.After he finishes, the men's chorus bellows: Why do thenations rage?The piece, however, ends in a Mahlerian motif and chorusdeclaring a message Bernstein had sought for society:Behold how good,And how pleasant it is,For brethren to dwellTogether in unity.To emphasize the point after the final note, Slatkin suspendedhis hands for several long moments of silence. Then came thecascade of applause. For Leonard Bernstein.Actresses Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden andPhyllis Newman are among performers in the birthday bash beingthrown in August for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the musiccenter where he got his start.The Tanglewood Music Center also is celebrating the 50thanniversary of its Music Shed this summer with a special concert bythe resident Boston Symphony Orchestra featuring the same music,Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, that inaugurated the building in 1938.The Bernstein weekend alone, with tickets as high as $5,000each, may bring in more than $1 million for the festival'sendowment fund, according to Caroline Smedvig of the symphony.Because Tanglewood is so special for him and, conversely, he'sso special to us, the combination will produce what we hope will bea unique event, she said.The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a four-dayaffair beginning on the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to raisemoney for the music center.Beverly Sills, who announced last month that she will step downas general director of the New York City Opera, will be the host ofthe event. Bacall and soprano Barbara Hendricks will perform amovement from Bernstein's Symphony No. 3, Kaddish. Violinsoloist Midori will play two movements from his Serenade.Dame Gwyneth Jones and Frederica von Stade will be among thoseperforming highlights from Fidelio and other works to honorBernstein's landmark opera recordings.The concert will also celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments inpopular music with excerpts from such works as West Side Storyand On the Town.The orchestra opened the nine-week season with the special July1 concert marking the first half-century of the Music Shed.The season of classical music will be expanded with performancesby such popular rock, jazz and folk artists as The Beach Boys,George Benson and Leo Kottke.But the highlight of the new season is the celebration ofBernstein's birthday.The BSO is even billing the birthday party as one of the musicworld's great occasions and is negotiating the television rightsin the United States and Europe.Among the conductor's friends who have been invited to the bashare pop star Michael Jackson and British Princess Diana, althoughTanglewood officials say the have not yet received an answer fromthe celebrities.Bernstein was a member of the original Tanglewood Music Centerclass of 1940, where he became a protege of Tanglewood founderSerge Koussevitzky.When Koussevitzky retired in 1949, he tried to have the youngBernstein named as his successor, but the BSO's trustees choseCharles Munch because they considered Bernstein too young andtainted by popular music.He later wrote the score for the musical West Side Story andreturned every summer to conduct and teach.Conductors Seiji Ozawa, John Williams, John Mauceri and MichaelTillson Thomas will share the poduim featuring some of his works onthe night of his birth.The following night, Ozawa and special guests will appear in aMusic Shed concert for a performance intended to show Bernstein'sinfluence on other musicians.Aug. 27 will be given over to a performance of Bernstein'sMass by a 250-member troupe from the Indiana University schoolof music.The four-day celebration concludes with Bernstein conducting theannual Serge and Ola Koussevitzky Memorial Concert, including aperformance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5, on Aug. 28.All proceeds go to the music center's endowment fund, and to afund Bernstein established for aspiring young conductors. Ticketprices start at $20 for a space on the lawn and go up to $5,000 forfront row seats for benefactors.Other highlights of the new season include several major debuts,including that of Soviet painist Vladimir Feltsman, who arrived inthe United States last August after an an eight-year battle toemigrate; a return visit by the Israel Philharmonic; and a recitalby Irish flutist James Galway.This summer is the second in a four-year jubilee of thefestival's 50th anniversary. Events climax in 1990 with observancesmarking the 50th year of the music center, the festival's school.Leonard Bernstein, whose wide-ranging talentsand flamboyant personality helped make him the first Americanmaestro to conquer music's international podium, was buried todayalongside his wife.Bernstein, who died of lung failure Sunday at age 72, was buriedthis afternoon in private ceremonies at Greenwood Cemetery inBrooklyn. His wife, Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New York Philharmonicperforms, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's firstAmerican-born music director. Bernstein was appointed in 1958 andstepped down in 1969 to spend more time composing.The Philharmonic will perform an all-Bernstein program beginningThursday and continuing through Oct. 23. The schedule had calledfor works by Shostakovich and Beethoven.A memorial concert also is planned for Carnegie Hall on Nov. 14,the 47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic debut.Famed for his gymnastics at the podium, Bernstein composedsymphonies as well as movie scores and Broadway shows such asWest Side Story, On the Town and Candide.His Emmy-winning Young People's Concerts on televisionintroduced thousands to classical music.He was the most unique musician of this century, there is nodoubt about it, said Zubin Mehta, music director of the New YorkPhilharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.Larry Kert, who played Tony in the Broadway production of WestSide Story, said Bernstein himself played the piano for himduring rehearsals.He could have gotten a rehearsal pianist, but he cared toomuch, Kert said. I was the new kid on the block and he strokedme and took care of me - and I will never forget him for that.Conductor Leonard Bernstein, the West SideStory composer who mesmerized audiences with his passion andphysical flair at the podium, is giving up the baton because ofpoor health.The 72-year-old maestro suffers from a lung tumor, emphysema andpulmonary infections and has been told by his doctor to stopconducting and performing on the piano, his spokeswoman saidTuesday.Leonard Bernstein will henceforth devote his professionalenergies to composing, writing and education, said MargaretCarson.He last conducted Aug. 19 at the Tanglewood Music Center inwestern Massachusetts.Bernstein's announcement was met with dismay in the music world,especially at the New York Philharmonic, which he directed from1958 to 1969.

He conducted his first symphony, the Jeremiah, with thePittsburgh Symphony in 1944. That year his ballet, Fancy Free,choreographed by Jerome Robbins, opened and became the basis forthe Broadway musical On the Town.After Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Serge Koussevitzkydied in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conductingdepartments at Tanglewood.

50,d061j,"Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless lowpressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf ofMexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind thatbaffles forecasters.It's a matter of getting everything together in the rightplace in the right time, Gil Clark of the National HurricaneCenter said Thursday. It doesn't happen very often. How itdevelops, we don't know.Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as adry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer. About one ofsix develop, said Clark.By Sept. 8, the system became a depression. It reached tropicalstorm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a namedtropical storm. It reaches hurricane status when sustained windshit 74 mph.Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systemsdidn't is a mystery more or less, said University of Miamimeteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.The first part of the summer we were biting our nails,wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop, he saidThursday. That's something meteorologists would like to know moreabout.But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm oncedevelopment begins. And they know that development is sparked whenwinds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture inthe lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), thisconvergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation, Blecksaid.If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the cloudsoccasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergencepattern. That strengthens it, he said, adding that storms canbegin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.Eventually, a vortex is created.Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, thosewinter storms, Bleck said.Hurricanes are useful to the climate machine. Their primaryrole is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,he said. The sun puts energy into the water, the top of theoceans and lowest part of the atmosphere. That has to bedistributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere.When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados,warm Atlantic waters nurtured it.This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best fordevelopment, Clark said. If you get a storm in this area inSeptember, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This iswhere Camille formed and exploded, referring to the 1969 stormthat slammed into the Gulf Coast.It is an exciting thing to watch. If you're on the beachwatching the storm surge, it's a different story, he said.The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm onrecord in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inchesTuesday night. That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricanethat devastated the Florida Keys.Hurricane Gilbert swepttoward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alertedits heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavyrains and high seas.The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustainedwinds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph.There is no need for alarm, Civil Defense Director EugenioCabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday.Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closelyfollow Gilbert's movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in theprovince, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 mileswest of Santo Domingo.Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean andstrengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The NationalHurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday atlatitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south ofPonce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo.The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, saidGilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a broad area ofcloudiness and heavy weather rotating around the center of thestorm.The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Ricoand the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastalflooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to PuertoRico's south coast. There were no reports of casualties.San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gustsSaturday, but they subsided during the night.On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropicalstorm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mphwinds and sheets of rain.Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic stormseason, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimalhurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast lastmonth.Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongeststorms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday andleveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut offthe Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.Looters roamed the streets of Cancun, stealing from stores whosewindows were blown away. Huge waves battered the beach resorts andthousands were evacuated. Despite the intensity of the onslaughtand the ensuing heavy flooding, officials reported only two minorinjuries.The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and five in the DominicanRepublic before moving west to Mexico. Prime Minister Edward Seagaof Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000of Jamaica's 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday.The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier that 500,000 of thenation's 2.3 million people were homeless.In Cancun, amateur radio operators said an oil tanker from thefleet of the government oil monopoly Pemex, the Lazaro Cardenas,had run aground on the beach in the Cancun hotel zone. Pemexofficials however said all their vessels were secure.Army officials in Mexico City said about 35,000 people wereevacuated from Cancun, but Cancun Mayor Jose Sanchez Zapata saidabout 11,000 fled.More than 120,000 people on the northeast Yucatan coast wereevacuated, the Yucatan state government said.The eye of the storm passed over Cozumel and Cancun with howlingwinds clocked at 160 mph at about 8 a.m. EDT. The winds bent andtoppled utility poles and uprooted slum dwellings.Ham radio operators around Cancun said Gilbert knocked down aradio and television communications tower, uprooted trees and blewthe roofs off buildings.Floods prevented officials from reaching the hotel zone inCancun and there were no relief efforts under way by lateWednesday. Shelters had little or no food, water or blankets andpower was out.We can't do it yet. The wind would blow them away, said anarmy official at city hall who declined to give his name.Bands of 25-30 youths roamed the streets of Cancun Wednesday,looting stores with shattered windows, said Alfredo Moro Sanchez,investigative coordinator of the Quintana Roo state judicial police.He said he asked for army troops to halt the looting but nonehad arrived by late Wednesday.About 150 tourists took refuge at the Cancun city hall.Honeymooner Sheila Fournier of Long Island said she and herhusband, Pete, had been evacuated from the Villas Playa Hotel.It had an ocean-front view  which is now washed away, shesaid.Officials were checking low-lying areas of Cancun for strandedresidents. There was heavy damage visible to the humble wood andthatch homes typical of the Yucatan.There were some people who did not want to leave yesterday,the army official said. It was something new. They didn't knowwhat a cyclone was.At midnight EDT Gilbert was centered near latitude 21.5 north,longitude 90.2 west and approaching the north coast of Yucatan,about 60 miles east-northeast of the provincial capital, Merida,the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said. Thestorm was about 550 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, thecenter said in a statement.Gilbert was moving west-northwest at 15 mph and winds haddecreased to 125 mph. The Mexican National Weather Service reportedwinds gusting as high as 218 mph earlier Wednesday with sustainedwinds of 179 mph.Earlier Wednesday Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm,the strongest ad deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms havemaximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can causecatastrophic damage.By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded itto a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:There's noquestion it'll strengthen again once it comes off the YucatanPeninsula and gets back in open water.As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesdaynight, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles ofthunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that hascrossed land and is moving over the water again.One eye was about eight miles wide, and the second about 25miles wide, said hurricane center meteorologist Jesse Moore. Thisis one of the features that we expected to see as the hurricanemoved back over the water, and we do expect intensification, hesaid.Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States  the1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camillethat devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 people.Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in theGulf of Mexico.The peninsula ports of Campeche, Celestum, Progreso, Sinzal,Ucaltepen, Tel-Chac, Cancun, Puerto Morelos, and Ciudad del Carmenwere closed, the government news agency Notimex said. Airports inthe region were closed.The sound of the wind outside is horrible, said receptionistPablo Torres at Cancun's Hotel Carrillos as the storm approached.The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane watch was ineffect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur and alongthe coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north.In Mexico City, the National Civil Defense System said it losttelephone contact with Cancun and Cozumel at about 8 a.m. EDT.Public buildings in Cancun were used as shelters, said CecilaLavalle, a spokesman for Quintana Roo state government in Chetumal,155 miles southeast of Cozumel.Jennie Valdez, a U.S. consular representative in Cancun, saidshe did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but governmentfigures estimate 40,000 to 65,000 monthly visitors.Hurricane warnings were in effect for the entire YucatanPeninsula and widespread evacuations were reported.Winds destroyed at least 100 homes in slums of Valladolid, atown of about 45,000 about 100 miles from Cozumel, Alberto Pol, ajudicial police officer, said by telephone.The National Hurricane Center said Gilbert was the most intensestorm on record in terms of barometric pressure. It was measured at26.31 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the WesternHemisphere, said forecaster Mark Zimmer.On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Gilbert pounded the DominicanRepublic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.Seaga said Jamaica would need $8 billion in aid. Officials inthe Dominican Republic, sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reportedfive dead.Gilbert also buffeted the Cayman Islands, but no deaths werereported.Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingstonon Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofsoff homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricanearound noon.For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearingbranches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper throughthe air.The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston'sairport and aircraft parked on its fields.The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across thecity. Skies brightened, the winds died down and people waited foran hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived.All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami InternationalAirport.Flights from the Cayman Islands, reportedly next in the path ofthe hurricane, arrived in Miami packed with travelers cutting shorttheir vacations. People were running around in the main lobby ofour hotel (on Grand Cayman Island) like chickens with their headscut off, said one man.A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was movingwest at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. It saidJamaica would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would causeflash floods and mud slides.Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica, said BobSheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across thatisland, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerfulhurricane, he said.Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico,Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issuedMonday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the CaymanIslands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for theDominican Republic.High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingstonovernight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and litteringstreets with branches.Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding upwindows in preparation for the hurricane.The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of themountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as muchdamage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urgedresidents to seek higher ground.Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people wereevacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation'ssoutheastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush theisland.In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay,Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken variousprecautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of thehurricane.Lt. Ken Ross, a spokesman, said the Navy station at Guantanamoreported that as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the brunt of the storm appearedto be passing southeastern Cuba. They have reported maximum windsof 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots, said Ross. But there areno reports of injuries or damage.The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved toCondition Two, meaning electrical power usage was cut back toonly essential uses and all non-essential personnel sent to theirbarracks.The storm also skirted Puerto Rico without causing any damage tomilitary facilities, Ross said.Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the CaymanIslands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veernorthwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Residents of theneighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, wereurged to rush all preparatory actions.The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans couldexpect high waters and large waves which may undermine buildingsalong the beaches.All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue tomonitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane, the serviceadvised.Forecaster Hal Gerrish on Sunday described Gilbert certainlyone of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a longtime.Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mphwinds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today afterskirting Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.There were no immediate reports of casualties. Telephonecommunications were affected.Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica, said BobSheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. We'vealready had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip.It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across thatisland, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerfulhurricane, Sheets said.Forecasters say Gilbert was expected to lash Jamaica throughoutthe day and was on track to later strike the Cayman Islands, asmall British dependency northwest of Jamaica.Meanwhile, Havana Radio reported today that 25,000 people wereevacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba's southeastern coast asstrong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island.All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami InternationalAirport, while flights from Grand Cayman, the main island of thethree-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers.People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (onGrand Cayman) like chickens with their heads cut off, said onevacationer who was returning home to California through Miami.Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands, Cuba andHaiti.

Government officials of the island nations in its westerly path issued alerts, warnings and orders to evacuate their southerly-exposed coastal areas.  Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican escaped with only some coastal flooding and a few deaths before Gilbert continued on to strike Jamaica with 110mph winds and torrential rains.  The storm, now one of the largest systems seen in the Caribbean for a long time, slowly traversed the length of the island causing massive damage and nineteen deaths.  100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes were destroyed leaving 500,000 people homeless.  The storm then passed over the Cayman Islands located south of Cuba.  Cuba and our American military bases there both avoided the brunt of the storm before it slammed full force into the Yucatan Peninsula.  By now Gilbert had strengthened into the most severe hurricane ever recorded with barometric pressure of 26.31 inches and sustained winds of 179mph, gusting to 218mph.  Relief efforts for the heavily damaged Cancun and Cozumel areas were hindered due to massive flooding and power and phone outages.

51,d064j,"Two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns. The subject was no laughing matter, but rather the serious endeavor of finding South Korea's Ronald McDonald. Seven years after the U.S. hamburger giant first tried to bring its Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arches were finally going up. McAhn Industries Ltd. recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul. The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young. McDonald's is flourishing in 11 other nations in the region. But its entry into South Korea, which has Asia's fastest-growing economy, had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from Seoul on terms. South Korea may be one of McDonald's most promising foreign markets, business analysts say. The country is developing an essential ingredient for the success of a fast-food enterprise: a middle class. Hamburger-related fast-food sales in South Korea totaled $87.5 million last year, a 30% rise from 1986, according to the Ministry of Finance. Analysts say this year's rise could be much bigger, helped by a 25% increase in wages in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expected soon. The business is likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipated post-Olympic economic boom here. However, the competition is heating up, and there is ""a good possibility that South Korea already has reached the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket,"" an official for the South Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry says. The competition, besides Wendy's International's 11 shops and six of Burger King, a unit of Pillsbury Co., includes home-grown burger chains. McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly, avoiding extravagances, Mr. Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say. ""We are starting small,"" says Mr. Ahn. ""We're hoping to open three outlets this year and five next year. After that, we'd like to open five every year."" Equally modest, he says, will be the initial menu: no breakfast, no Chicken McNuggets and no products tailored to national tastes, as offered elsewhere. The venture is rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper, more oldfashioned approach: a brief advertising campaign in newspapers, distribution of fliers and word of mouth. Mr. Sifri says the emphasis will be on developing McDonald's image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class, rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in South Korea. Attention will be given to attracting children, he adds. Mr. Ahn says McDonald's talked to 16 potential partners before choosing the Harvard-trained accountant in 1984. Two years later, McDonald's and Mr. Ahn each put up $1 million in capital and borrowed an additional $4 million to form McAhn. McDonald's struggled with the government over McAhn's royalty payments to the U.S. partner -- the issue was resolved -- and over tight import restrictions on food products. The import question ""came down to finding a supplier locally who could supply high-quality beef and potatoes at a value,"" McDonald's said. Even McDonald's golden arches symbol ran into red tape, since the city regulates the size and color of signs. ""It may be against the law, but we're putting them up anyway,"" Mr. Ahn says.McDonald's hamburgers, fries and goldenarches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened itsfirst restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine.Hundreds of Chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant inShenzhen, an economic boom town near Hong Kong, for their firsttaste of a McDonald's hamburger, fries or shake.I travelled for four hours from a village to get here, saidHuang Rongti, 70, who has lost most of her teeth because of age.You think hamburgers are too challenging for my age?Later, after purchasing her first Big Mac, she inspected itcarefully before taking a bite.It tastes good, I like it, she announced before slowlyeating the rest.The opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, wherecooking has long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd togourmets. It is estimated there are more than 5,000 differentChinese dishes.In Canton, 125 miles northwest of Shenzhen, chefs specialize insome of the more exotic Chinese dishes, such as cat stew, bearpaws, chicken feet and a famed snake dish - Dragon and TigerLocked in Battle - made from three kinds of poisonous snakesstewed with leopard meat, and garnished with 20 spices, lemonleaves and chrysanthemum petals.However, many Chinese, who earn an average $32 a month, arestill unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants.In Shenzhen, a Chinese special economic zone where foreigninvestors have built factories, salaries are higher and workersearn an average of $53 a month.At the restaurant, a Big Mac costs $1.14, a bag of fries 48cents and a shake 74 cents.Another U.S. fast food outlet, Kentucky Fried Chicken, opened arestaurant in Beijing in 1987, and it now has four outlets there.McDonald's hopes to open a restaurant in Beijing later.Although Kentucky Fried Chicken has become popular, the averageChinese still regards a meal there as a treat, rather than aconvenience, and McDonald's could face the same problems.The 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in a three-story building isoperated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a wholly ownedsubsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong. McDonald's Hong Kong is a 50-50joint venture with McDonald's in the United States.It is managed by a Chinese national, Chen Tikang, and his son,Chen Yin, who is the restaurant manager. The younger Chen returnedrecently from a course at McDonald's hamburger university in OakBrook, Ill.Most of the ingredients used at the restaurant are now importedfrom Hong Kong. But McDonald's executives hope eventually to gettheir supplies of beef and potatoes from China.Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., saidit took two years to prepare for the restaurant's opening and hisambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year.Last month, when McDonald's advertized for 240 staffers for therestaurant, it received applications from more than 9,000 persons,including college graduates, officials said.I feel I have a better job prospect working here, and it paysbetter, said Henry He, 25, who has a master's degree in garmentand textile. He is an assistant manager at the restaurant.A waiter at the restaurant can earn 53 cents an hour.A factory worker, who waited several hours before she was ableto purchase her hamburger, said she liked it because of its sweettaste - the result of tomato ketchup, which is not commonly usedin traditional Chinese cooking.AS THE value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worryabout a host of obstacles to investing in Russia, Russian officials hadseveral reasons yesterday to feel thankful for McDonald's hamburgers.Opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-storeyoffice block, Mr George Cohon, head of McDonald's Canada, could well bedescribed as the Russian authorities' idea of a model investor.McDonald's proven determination 'to be here for the long term' and to serveRussians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by mostother foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for Russiangratitude.Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, praised the fact thatMcDonald's gets most of its supplies from inside Russia after setting up aDollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow.He also thanked McDonald's for providing jobs, a model of western standardsfor the country's decrepit service industry, and finally for what hedescribed as 'the most delicious food'.But despite the jolly opening ceremony - with Big Macs, musicians playingthe balalaika, and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant M - life hasbeen tough for McDonald's since it opened its first restaurant in Moscow 31/2 years ago.Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonald's in the worldthe plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules havebeen a challenge to McDonald's management, who admitted that they have noidea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment.'It will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants, what happens tothe rouble, what happens to raw materials that we buy. We don't have anestimate of how long it will take. There are too many variables,' said MrCohon.Apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor, the McDonald's officeblock is rented out to western companies in an attempt to generate hardcurrency alongside the mountains of roubles made from selling hamburgers.Communism suffered its first Big Macattack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia,and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hoursfrom getting too unruly under the golden arches.I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers, saidMilica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours totaste her first Big Mac.People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plushinterior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, frenchfries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West. Italso featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-coloredupholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination.The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, had drawncrowds in recent days, and they began gathering long before itopened Thursday.Police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around theblock, and they regulated the number who came inside to avoidovercrowding.No opening of a restaurant in Belgrade has created such asensation as this one today, one policeman said.I think this restaurant has no competition in Belgrade, saidMilica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger.It is much cleaner, the service is faster, the interior is nicerand it is not too expensive.The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonald'sin Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomedto a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: groundpork and onions on a bun.In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac andPljeskavica, said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, aYugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint ventureagreement with McDonald's.Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslavmarket, said Predrag Dostanic, managing director of theGenex-McDonald's. We want to change customs of the local peopleused to completly different eating habits.He said that lounging at tables for a long time after a finishedmeal will draw a warning. Also, smoking is forbidden and alcoholwill not be served.This contrasts sharply with the Balkan and Yugoslav custom ofsitting with a drink in smoke-filled restaurants and chatting withfriends after the meal.The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink andfrench fries costs the equivalent of $2.57, or about as much thesimilar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joints around town.Sadik Seljami, a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a fewhundred yards from the McDonald's, suggested that the Americanrestaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out ofbusiness.However, we will not give up the fight even if we have tolower the prices, said Seljami.Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp., said during theopening ceremonies, We are very excited about the opening of thisrestaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communistcountry, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe.McDonald's and Genex contribute $1 million each for the flagshiprestaurant. They will also share the profits equally even though itwill be managed entirely by Yugoslavs.The restaurant has 350 seats and employs 110 people capable ofserving 2,500 meals per hour. In an effort to keep a high level ofservices, the management is entitled to fire any employees who failto perform.The American corporation plans to open five additionalrestaurants Yugoslavia in the next five years. The next EastEuropean McDonald's, and the first in a Soviet bloc country, is toopen next month in Budapest, Hungary.The communist world gets its firstMcDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whetherits American hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-foodtreat, Pljeskavica.The long-awaited opening of the restaurant on one of Belgrade'smain downtown squares will take place March 24, the Yugoslav newsagency Tanjug reported, and it will offer Big Macs, fries and theother specialities familiar to McDonald's customers in the West.The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of theAmerican restaurant depends on its acceptance by Yugoslavians whoare long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica.Pljeskavica is made of ground pork and onions, and it is servedon bread and eaten with the hands. It is sold at fast-foodrestaurants across the country and costs about a dollar.In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac andPljeskavica, said an official of Genex, Yugoslavia's largeststate-run enterprise that will operate the McDonald's.John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill.,headquarters, said it was the first of the chain's outlets in acommunist country.The next East European McDonald's is scheduled to be opened inBudapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna Milosevic,another Genex official.Negotiations have been going on for years for expanding thefast-food chain to the Soviet Union, but no agreement has beenannounced.Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesdaycheerfully lined up to get a taste of gamburgers,chizburgers and Filay-o-feesh sandwiches as McDonald'sopened in the land of Lenin for the first time.The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-foodchain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking theopening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said.The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed,lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant, the first of20 planned across the Soviet Union. The crush of customers was sointense the company stayed open until midnight, two hours laterthan planned.I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands beforeme, said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant.And it was only 10 rubles for all this, she said. I'mtaking it back for the girls at the factory to try.Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at3 rubles  about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's stafferor the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other privaterestaurants that have sprung up recently.The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreignvisitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currencyis worth on the black market.Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund,which provides medical care and assistance to orphans anddisadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president ofMcDonald's Canada, said from Toronto.The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with thecity of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number ofcountries where McDonald's operates.The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest,company officials said. Besides its restaurants in the UnitedStates, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan,the officials said.Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concepts asefficiency and fast, friendly service. Normally dour citizens brokeinto grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood fromyouthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and workhard.Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumesdanced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and BabaYaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales.One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they sayanything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smilingyoung Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into hisdrink.For most customers, it was their first experience with ahamburger. Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked withthe golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillicletters, approximating gamburger.They tried them one-handed. They picked their sandwiches apartto examine the contents. One young woman finally squashed herBeeg Mak to fit her lips around it.It tasted great! a 14-year-old boy said.It's a lot different from a stolovaya, he continued with asmile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeteriasthat slop rice and fat or boiled sausage.Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviethammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-awaitedgrand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedlyfor McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's armyfulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos.Publicity-conscious managers had the staff shout Good morning,America! in English and Russian, for an American TV network.McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind thedeal, said many people were buying multiple orders and therestaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first fivehours of operation.The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer inhopes of preventing burger-scalping.McDonald's built its own factory, including bakery, dairy,meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide itsown guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of theharvest rots en route to the consumer.One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importingwooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because when theywent to build crates, they found there was no wood, and no nails.They found you need a permit to buy nails.","LA020190-0038,WSJ880412-0015,AP901008-0136,FT932-5869,AP880324-0193,AP880314-0110,AP900131-0200","McDonald's opens restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China.","McDonald's moved into new markets, opening restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the firstcommunist country to get a McDonald's, the Soviet Union, and China.

Large crowds stood in line for hours atopenings in Belgrade, Moscow, and Peking. Customers in Yugoslavia, the firstcommunist country to get a McDonald's, and China raved about the taste of the Big Mac.In Moscow, the Russians were less enthusiastic about its taste but gave a thumbs up tothe shakes.

After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.  To participate in Asia's fastest expanding economy, came their first restaurant in South Korea.  Moving into communist countries, its opening in Belgrade, Yugoslavia was followed by a record shattering opening of its largest outlet anywhere in Moscow.

In Moscow thousands lined up for an opening day record of 30,000 meals being served at 27 cash registers.  Next, McDonald's opened in China, where cooking is a culinary art.

In 1988, seven years after its first attempt to bring a restaurant to South Korea, McDonald's successfully joint-ventured with Ahn Hyo Young, a Harvard schooled entrepreneur. McAhn Enterprises Ltd. had to fight government red tape and develop local suppliers in order to open in Seoul.  That year, Big Mac also braved the communist world.  On March 24, 1988, McDonald's successfully opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  Its local competition was the hamburger-like pljeskavica, i.e., ground pork and onion served on bread and eaten by hand.

52,d069f,"The mass emigration of thousands of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk in West Germany, where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two Germanys. No one is predicting a date for a possible reunification. Proponents acknowledge the risks of assuming too much of East Bloc reform trends, and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to Washington and Moscow. Yet growing signs of ferment in East Germany have given Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government reason to consider the possibilities. Eduard Lintner, parliamentary speaker on German affairs for the joint Christian Democrat and Christrian Socialist caucus in the Bundestag, said his committee has placed reunification on its October agenda. He said the sessions, which will include government officials and outside experts, hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with West Germany's Western allies, particularly the U.S. ""It has become clear to the world that the Communist system in East Germany is in trouble,"" Mr. Lintner said. ""The time has come for us to show our allies, but also reform-minded people in the East, that German reunification is no longer just a theory but a subject requiring a serious appraisal of how it could come about."" ""There are still a number of imponderables,"" Mr. Linter conceded. ""For instance, we want the federal government to approach our allies and get their thoughts on the reunification topic."" The U.S. ambassador to Bonn, Vernon A. Walters, earlier this month reaffirmed Washington's policy of supporting a German reunification based on free, democratic elections. But Mr. Walters caused a stir by predicting that reunion could occur in the relatively near future. Emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany has raised questions on how long East Berlin's leaders can resist the democratic reforms sweeping through neighboring East Bloc countries. Reforms in Poland, Hungary and even the Soviet Union have magnified East Germany's Stalinist controls. Fledgling protest groups, and the influential Protestant church, have begun pressing for reforms in East Germany which, if allowed to include free elections, could eventually lead to a reunited Germany, according to some Western experts. Dorothee Wilms, Bonn's cabinet minister for inter-German affairs, said in an interview in the newspaper Welt am Sonntag that recent polls show that between 85% and 90% of all West Germans favor a reunifed Germany. ""The desire for reunification, a feeling of togetherness, a sense of nationhood -- all this has strongly increased in recent years,"" Ms. Wilms told the newspaper. ""The recent escape movement from the DDR makes especially clear that people of both German states want to live free amongst themselves,"" she said, but cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight. The first step, she added, ""is the reform process in the DDR."" Most West German governments since 1949 have paid only lip service to the reunification goal set down in the preamble of West Germany's constitution. Political realities have prevented the topic from becoming a serious issue. Analysts say that four decades of different systems would make reunification difficult. Further, many West German workers worry that a mass influx of East Germans could threaten their jobs. Thousands of East Germans have emigrated to West Germany over the Austro-Hungarian border since Budapest ignored East Berlin's protests and opened its border. Close to 80,000 East German refugees have arrived in West Germany so far this year, either legally or by escaping, and a total of more than 100,000 are expected by December. The Soviets have joined East Berlin in criticizing Bonn for welcoming the East German refugees, and chided Hungary for violating an emigration treaty with East Germany by allowing them to leave. Moscow, which has tolerated reforms elsewhere in the East Bloc, is said to be concerned by conditions in East Germany, perhaps the most important of its Warsaw Pact satellites. Unconfirmed West German intelligence reports appearing in the West German media said Moscow fears a growing dissident movement and mass demonstrations in East Germany by next year. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev accepted an invitation to attend East Germany's 40th anniversary celebration, providing an opportunity for serious discussions with Erich Honecker, East Berlin's ailing party leader. East Germany's Communist leadership, commented the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, ""has no illusions as to why Gorbachev is honoring their 40th anniversary. He certainly will not say 'well done, keep it up.'""The government on Thursday allowed for thepossibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must beformed gradually and respect Poland's borders.In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on theissue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament thetwo German states could be joined as part of the process of unitingEurope.He said German reunification cannot go ahead of thereunification of Europe.A reunited Germany will not be created tomorrow or the dayafter tomorrow, Skubiszewski said. Fears and concerns appearingevery now and then, including in Poland, are unjustified, althoughalertness is recommended.Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk,Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers no politicalchanges in Europe, but there should be all kinds of economicintegrations.Western European countries have agreed to form an economic unionby the end of 1992.Sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in East Germany inthe past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests,spurring talk of reuniting the two German states divided at the endof World War II. West Germany has proposed a plan for greaterunity, but East German leaders reject reunification.The specter of a powerful, reunited Germany has troubed manyPoles, especially the older ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasionof Poland that began World War II.A reported surge in anti-Polish sentiment in East Germany inrecent weeks has heightened Polish anxieties.Skubiszewski's speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that thegovernment does not see unification in the near future and willinsist on Poland's current borders.Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sprogram for gradual German reunification, offered last week, fornot making clear that reunification would respect the existingborder between Poland and East Germany.Some right-wing West German politicians have called forrecovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that Germany lostto Poland at the end of World War II. The territory is aboutone-third of present-day Poland.East Germany and West Germany each separately has recognized theborder, but there has been no official assurance that a reunifiedGermany would also acknowledge the border.One can only unite within established borders and withoutterritorial arguments, said Skubiszewski.He also said German reunification is unlikely as long as WestGermany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led WarsawPact military alliance.The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership metto implement the final solution against Europe's Jewishpopulation will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conferenceon German reunification.The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that themeeting is scheduled for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day.The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification,said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.I think that the place where they decided on the `finalsolution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and theanniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day.Some 100 members of the World Jewish Congress from about 70countries will attend the conference at the villa in Wannsee,Berlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and partyofficials adopted a plan to exterminate the Jews.Jews have a right to state a moral position on Germanreunification and we will make a moral statement. And part of thatmoral statement is to see that it (the Holocaust) doesn't happenagain, Bronfman said.In the long run, he said, a united Germany can be a verypositive thing for Europe, but certain precautions must be takento prevent a repeat of history. For example, Germany's bordersmust be sealed in cement, and the country should not be allowednuclear weapons, he said.Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitismonce the two Germanys are united. In fact, he said, reunificationmight cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings.Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't beblaming the Jews for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.The conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration onGerman reunification will be issued May 8. It will be the firstmeeting ever held on German soil by the World Jewish Congress,which was founded in 1936 in response to Hitler's threats againstJews.Three decades ago, a West Germanpolitician said German reunification was a sleeping lionessthat would awake one day with a mighty roar.Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at handto create a giant political and economic machine that coulddominate Europe.Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether itwill take 10, 15 or 20 years, says West German conservativelawmaker Eduard Lintner. We have the impression that things aremuch more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East Germanleader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalistWest has revived international interest in the debate.Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of Germanreunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush andsomething short of a categorical no from President Mikhail S.Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic.If there were a free choice under the present circumstances inthe German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percentto 90 percent would vote for national reunification with theFederal Republic of Germany, added the 44-year-old Lintner in anAssociated Press interview.The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but ithas not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the yearssince the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West atthe end of World War II.Full national reunification would completey rework the postwarEuropean order mapped out by the conquering Allies. It is aprospect that creates unease in Britain and France, and in Polandin the East bloc.London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out apossible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in Europe,Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary.Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guaranteesfrom Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances, theTimes' futuristic view continued. West Germany withdraws fromNATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes forreunification and neutrality.That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosensits hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union,Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms.The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and otherbarriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many,ominous.As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even furtherto the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, anddespite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of manySoviet bloc neighbors.A unified Germany could become the political focal point of acontinent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts ofthe Soviet bloc.Older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator AdolfHitler's boasting that he had brought about the unity of theGerman nation.Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and EasternEurope at the French Institute of International Relations, says shebelieves that as far as public opinion there is new sort ofmistrust toward Germany.This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France, sheadded.Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines oftwo competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification wouldhave to come from Washington and Moscow.During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said thatreunification is a matter for the Germans to decide.But he added: If that (reunification) was worked out betweenthe Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Westerninterests.For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a newsconference in Bonn in June, saying only, the situation in Europetoday was determined by historical realities.Outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have beensharply divided on the issue.In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to begoverned by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions, wrotecommentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent. The ColdWar was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the comingof freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which findsits echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to theEast as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn'tnecessarily mean a single state although he called reunification ahypothesis that cannot be excluded.As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunificationalmost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the countryin near-record numbers. More than 100,000 East Germans are expectedto resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in theCommunist nation's work force.Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respectfor Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fireand water, Honecker added on the issue of reunification.There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successorswill be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining thecapitalist West.The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic earamong some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in thecountry that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.After all, the abnormal situation of the German nationovershadows the whole of Polish-German relations, member ofParliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity dailynewspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearlyprophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German stategovernor who later went on to head the centrist Free DemocraticParty.Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not todisturb her sleep, Maier predicted in 1955. The lioness willone day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quipby Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: I loveGermany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.West German officials and media today praisedSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for softening his view onGerman reunification and said it could give hope to disheartenedEast Germans.Disgraced former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker wasreleased from prison Tuesday night after justice officialsdetermined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonmentwhile awaiting trial on treason charges.Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germanywas likely in the future, but he added that Germans should notdecide this important question on the streets.He referred to the growing number of demonstrations in EastGermany in support of reunification.Gorbachev's statement was his most tolerant yet on the subjectof a single Germany, which has been opposed by Communists for morethan 40 years. East German Communists on Tuesday endorsed forreunification for the first time.In West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher toldWest German Radio that Gorbachev had correctly analyzed thesituation and again shown his political skill.West German officials and media praised Gorbachev's view asrealistic and described it as an important sign of hope forEast Germans who have lost faith in their government.Communist leaders launched their uphill campaign for March 18parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil theirEuropean concept that aims for a united and demilitarizedEurope.Party ideologist Peter Brie said the Communists support thetogetherness of the German nation, and urged a thoughtful andmeasured approach to reunification.In an interview with the West German Bild newspaper, partyleader Gregor Gysi complained that the reunification drive ismoving too quickly.Asked if the Communists oppose reunification, Gysi told thenewspaper: No, not at all. This process cannot be stopped anymore. But it is irresponsible to do things in such a way now as ifit were possible tomorrow.The reunification issue promises to dominate the electioncampaign that will seat a new leadership in less than seven weeks.Increasing numbers of East Germans have demonstrated for unionwith wealthy and prosperous West Germany as their own economytumbles and an exodus of skilled workers continues unchecked.More than 340,000 people fled East Germany last year, havinglost hope that their spartan living conditions would improve. Thedevastating flight has included as many as 2,500 people daily sinceJan. 1.The Communists are widely distrusted because of corruptionscandals that have surfaced since the peaceful pro-democracy revoltlast fall, and because they carry the blame for leading EastGermany into its current economic and political crises.The man most blamed for the country's problems, Honecker, wasset free after an East Berlin court rejected a request that he bekept in prison until his trial in March. He was jailed Monday.The court decided that despite the severity of the chargesagainst Honecker, the state of the accused's health does not permitimprisonment, the official ADN news agency reported.A spokesman for Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph promisedthat the investigation against Honecker would proceed.ADN said the court acted on advice from two doctors who examinedHonecker independently. Honecker, 77, underwent surgery on Jan. 8to remove a malignant kidney tumor.Honecker was ousted from the leadership on Oct. 18, aftermassive pro-democracy demonstrations. He was expelled from theCommunist Party in December and has since been accused of treasonand abusing his power.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday withEast German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open towardeventual German reunification.Modrow told reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev did notrule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time didnot venture to set some time limits for that.Earlier, the Kremlin chief said any such decisions must includethe four Allied powers and take into account European opinions.The development of events in the world, in East Germany, inthe Soviet Union demand deep consideration and an analyticalapproach to deciding this problem, he said in remarks reported bythe official news agency Tass.Time itself is acting on this process, giving it dynamism,Gorbachev said. We have to act responsibly and not decide thisimportant question on the streets.Tass said Gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuringrelations between the two Germanys must involve all directlyinterested governments.Asked by an East German correspondent about his attitude towardreunification, Gorbachev said the question was not unexpected andthat no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it.However, the English-language Tass translation indicatedGorbachev could have meant there were no doubts about reunificationitself.Gorbachev's position was similar to that adopted by Communistsin East Berlin on Tuesday. For the first time, the Communistsacknowledged German unity as a long-term goal but said it must beimbedded in the process of overcoming Europe's overall divisions.The Soviet Union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk ofGerman reunification, but Gorbachev has softened that position inadopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in Eastern Europe.Soviets say the question of German reunification is to bedecided in the future.Gorbachev, in comments to reporters after meeting FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterated hisview that the existence of two German states is a fact based on theoutcome of World War II.But he added, The present situation is the result of specifichistorical events, a specific historical process on this continent.So, history should decide the future of this continent.I don't think it is a topical question today. A differentapproach may create a situation that would complicate the entireEuropean process, including the relations between the two Germanstates, Gorbachev said.Modrow said the two Germanys could work toward confederation inphases with no time limit.He said he agreed with Gorbachev that reunification must bedecided not only by East and West Germany, but all of Europe.According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action onreunification must not infringe on the interests of either East orWest Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the UnitedStates or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free DemocraticParty, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in Londonthat Gorbachev has adopted a more positive attitude towardGerman reunification.In a TV interview on Britain's Channel 4, he also urgedeconomic union within 18 months as a prelude to full union ofWest and East Germany.Lambsdorff said that because of East Germany's politicalinstability it had only two choices  unification or chaos.Modrow invited Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to visitEast Germany and they accepted, Tass reported.Modrow arrived in Moscow late Monday. A Communist, he has movedforward the country's first free elections from May to March 18 andbrought the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then.Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be freeof party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policywithout regard to national, regional or global interests.Whatever policy the Kohl government followed over reunification, it wasbound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures inGermany. As the western German population is now aware, German reunificationneeds a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation ofeastern Germans' living standards until there is a sustained upswing in theeast - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbankwould wish.In Europe as a whole, very high real interest rates threaten to turnrecession into depression. The governments of Europe have been remarkablypatient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years ofEuropean effort for greater economic and political integration. Surely theremust be compromise of some economic habits to achieve the latter?It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-termreason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetarypriorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence isthreatening the EMU commitment.Beyond Europe, the dominant economic forces are strongly disinflationary.But Germany is the one economy which, for reasons of reunification, couldafford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front.Yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advises there are nogrounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates. This, despite theunreliability of German money supply data.The German government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetarytargets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployedin Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression.A DM exchange rate adjustment within the ERM is not the answer to theproblems. We need a prolonged low-interest-rate German reunification boom.The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as aresult of Bundesbank interest rate policies. And this is aggravatingrecession.A future European-wide central bank must clearly - like the US FederalReserve - be more accountable in the broader European political and economicinterest.The governments and central banks of Europe and the G7 block - including theKohl administration - should pressurise the Bundesbank, and be prepared toconsider constitutional changes if necessary, to halt this idiocy.Howard Flight,managing director,Guinness FlightGlobal Asset Management,Lighterman's Court,5 Gainsford Street,Tower Bridge,London SE1 2NEHistorians say the world need not fear thatGerman jackboots will echo again on European pavements, but somestill see the rush toward German reunification as a setback  astep away from the integration of Europe.For the most part, the historians say an East Germany collapsinginto chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a unitedGerman state.The West Germans are moving ahead not out of nationalisticfervor, but a perceived need to deal with a crisis, said HenryAshby Turner of Yale, author of The Two Germanies Since 1945.There is no such a thing as indelible national character,Turner said. I don't think there is any chance that the young menof Germany are going to slip out of their Adidas running shoes andpull on jackboots and start running around saying, `Heil!He was one of several experts in German history discussing theimplications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by thefour World War II allies  the United States, Britain, France andthe Soviet Union  to accept the reunification of a Germany theydivided 45 years ago.University of Chicago historian Michael Geyer, a native ofGermany, said he feared the creation of a strong, sovereignnation in the center of Europe could reverse a more importantdevelopment  the 40-year drive toward an integrated Europe inwhich industries, banks, trade unions and even governmentministries have been collaborating across borders.The East German state is collapsing, said Geyer. Sosomething has to happen very dramatically. But they have a choice the Europeans and Germans and Americans. Do they want to opt forthe European card or for the German card? I think they are optingfor the German card.I hear these days very little about what Gorbachev called `thehouse of Europe,' he said.The result of a dominant uncomfortably strong German state,Geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of nationalborders. It could also mean, he said, that American troops mighthave to stay in Europe as a counterweight to Germany.If I had my druthers reunifications would have happened after1992, after the integration of the West German economy into theeconomy of Western Europe, said Charles J. Herber of GeorgeWashington University, expressing similar concern.Then there would have been fewer chances for Germanadventurers, he said.West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings,said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presentedreunification within the context of European integration. Theywanted to avoid arousing fear of a united Germany again dominatingEurope.Even if the history did not exist, there would be fears ofthat kind, he said. We're dealing not just with rationalcalculation but a whole host of emotional memories.For all that, Breitman said, One Germany is not onlyinevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany overthe last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regimein chaos.The only alternative to reunification, added Turner, is anEast Germany in ruins, a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.He said Germans have no significant interest in territorialrevisions. Those misgivings are misplaced.Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considereda leading historian of the Nazi era, cautioned that reunification,if mishandled, could prove explosive.While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalisticdistrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, hesaid, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia,he said.I don't think the Germans are heading for Moscow again, but wehave to give people  and the Germans have to give people  time tothink this through and get used to it. ... Mishandled,reunification could scare one or the other of the participants intostarting something and scare others and goodness knows where itwould end.Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the divisionof Germany has been the basis of a peace settlement which workedpretty well but was abnormal and sooner or later had to becorrected.German reunification, said Craig, gives the world the chance tobuild a new international system, one that will prevent the useof international violence.He added, We have to be careful that we don't fall back intothe kind of system that existed before the Second World War, aEurope filled with nations that were suffering various grievances,rivalries, disputed frontiers, driven by what they considered to belegitimate reasons but pitted against each other  the sort ofthings that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.Chancellor Helmut Kohl assuredvisiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that WestGermany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one ofthe senators said Friday.He strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunifiedGermany be neutral, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, head of the Americandelegation, said of the Friday meeting with Kohl.Asked whether he thought the West Germans were committed tostaying in the NATO military alliance of Western nations, theIndiana Republican said: Without any reservations.There is growing discussion in West Germany about Germanreunification as a result of sweeping social and political reformsunderway in East Germany. There has been speculation that WestGermany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if theKremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification.Kohl on Tuesday unveiled a 10-point proposal with Germanreunification as its ultimate goal.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.

53,d063j,"Family members on Saturday grieved for theirslain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at theRoyal Marines Music School, where an IRA terrorist attack killed 10military musicians.Jean Cleatheroe, whose son Andrew was killed, joined localresidents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use ofprivate security firms to protect the music school and 29 othermilitary establishments in Britain.The security at those barracks was absolutely abysmal. We hadseen it for ourselves. We have always said how easy it would be foranyone to get in ... What could ordinary security men do to stopterrorists? she said.British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA'scampaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite thepredominantly Protestant province with the mainly Roman CatholicRepublic of Ireland.Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982, when 11 servicemenwere fatally wounded in bombings in central London.Shocked residents of Deal gathered outside the barracks to layflowers in tribute to the young men they called the Bandies.An 11-year-old Royal Marines cadet in full dress uniform marchedto the barracks and smartly saluted the Royal Marines sign.I'm proud of my uniform and I'm proud of all the Marines Iknew. I hate the people who did this to them, said Scott Roberts.Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of theChurch of England, visited the injured and said he was impressedby their strength and determination that evil will not defeatthem.Runcie said one of the men's main concerns was that their handswould heal properly so they could continue playing their musicalinstruments.Police investigating the attack were searching a nearby housethat had been rented briefly by three men with Irish accents.We know when the men arrived and when they left, Cmdr. GeorgeChurchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad,said at a news conference. It appears the men left several daysbefore the explosion.He said the house, which overlooks the barracks recreation centerdestroyed by the Friday morning blast, was rented by its Englishowners to three men for two to three weeks.There was no proof the house was an IRA hideout, the commandersaid.By virtue of the fact that the house is very near the base andthe men are Irish, we are very anxious to talk to them, he said.Explosives experts wearing white protective overalls werepainstakingly examining the house Saturday, and Churchill-Colemansaid they would continue for the next two or three days.Police said all 10 men killed during a coffee break betweenmorning band practices were servicemen. Of 22 men injured, 12remained hospitalized Saturday, five in serious condition.The Irish Republican Army on Friday claimed responsibility forthe explosion, which also severely damaged several nearby houses.Police have not determined what caused the blast, butChurchill-Coleman said, It would seem to be some form ofimprovised device using high explosives. The IRA did not specifyhow it caused the blast.An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School ofMusic in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building tocollapse and killing eight people, officials said. Thirty peoplewere injured and up to 18 were missing and feared trapped in therubble.The blast occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracksnear Deal, about 70 miles southeast of London, the Defense Ministrysaid.The building has collapsed, said a ministry spokesman,speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.We've no idea of the cause of the blast at the moment. It istoo early to tell.Scotland Yard said a forensic team from its anti-terrorist squadhad been called in to help investigate.Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras tosearch for those trapped in the debris, said Kent Fire Brigadespokesman Kevin Simmons.Kent police said 17 or 18 people were trapped. The DefenseMinistry said seven were missing.Ten doctors gave emergency treatment at the scene and 11ambulances took the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance servicesaid.They are suffering from flash burns to their head and arms,fractures, and the sort of injuries you would expect after anexplosion, said a spokesman for Buckland Hospital in Dover, 20miles south of Deal.South Eastern British Gas sent investigators to the scene butsaid there was nothing to indicate the explosion was caused by a gasleak. Gas supplies to the barracks were cut as a precautionarymeasure, a spokesman said.Guy Platts, who owns a bookstore in Deal, located 20 miles northof the English Channel port of Dover, said he heard a massiveexplosion. ... There are dozens of ambulances, police and firebrigade making their way there.Military targets on the British mainland have been attackedseveral times by the Irish Republican Army in the past year as partof its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA attack on anarmy barracks in north London in August 1988. About 60 soldiersnarrowly escaped death or injury in February when they wereevacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, justbefore a bomb exploded.In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near theHousehold Cavalry barracks at Knightsbridge in central London and ata bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band wasplaying. Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured inthe bombings.The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blewapart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britonsand stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveledthe three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break betweenpractice sessions on the school's parade ground.Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of themin serious condition, police said. They said nine of the dead werebandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified.Dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern Englishseaside town of Deal were damaged.Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col.John Ware, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen allwere trained, adult musicians. They held military ranks but none hadbeen trained as a fighting soldier.The outlawed Irish Republican Army, engaged in a 20-year-oldcampaign to drive the British from the province of Northern Ireland,claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Ireland International,a Dublin news agency.Residents of the area adjoining the Marines school said Fridaythat despite government calls for stepped-up public alertnessagainst terrorists, security at the school had eased noticeably.Anyone in Deal will tell you how easy it is to get into thebase, said Fred Verge, a 70-year-old army veteran.Local people laid wreaths and bouquets of flowers at the entranceto the barracks.There is a great sense of anger in the community, Kent policeChief Constable Paul Condon said.The Royal Marines Music School is one of 30 militaryestablishments in Britain that use private security firms, DefenseMinistry figures show.Unidentified defense sources quoted by the Times newspaper todaysaid the civilian guards were backed up by armed Marines whopatrolled regularly inside the perimeter.Defense Secretary Tom King promised a security review and saidnew measures had already been taken at the base. He did notelaborate.Martin O'Neill, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman ondefense, said on Friday: Serious questions must be asked about thepenny-pinching policy of the Ministry of Defense, which may well putour armed services at dreadful risk.O'Neill later told British Broadcasting Corp. television the IRAwas prepared to take out anybody. The cowardly nature of theirattacks is such that every military establishment is under threat.He said private security firms were assigned to areas consideredlow risks for attacks.If we designate places as being low-risk categories, then it islikely they will be attacked, given the way that the IRA is forcedto operate, O'Neill added.The big prizes are no longer available to them, so they'repicking off the ones which they regard ... vulnerable.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received news of the bombingwhile aboard a jet over Siberia en route from Japan to Moscow. Shecalled it a deeply serious outrage.King visited the scene soon after the explosion.I know that the people who committed it, the godfathers whosent them, actually know in their hearts that it is not going tomake any difference; that it is just killing for the sake ofkilling, he said.The defense minister, anger clearly written on his face, saidthat rather than erode the will of the security forces, the attackredoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannotwin.Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland condemned the attackand sent Mrs. Thatcher a message of sympathy at this outrage ...which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries.The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of theoperation, but said it was a response to a message of wardelivered by Mrs. Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland ninedays ago.It was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locallyrecruited Ulster Defense Regiment as a very, very brave group ofmen who have lost 179 members in IRA attacks since 1970.The mainly Protestant UDR is regarded by many Catholics as asectarian force, and is at present under a cloud over allegationsthat some recruits leaked names, addresses and photos of IRAsuspects to Protestant assassins.British military installations are a frequent target of the IRAcampaign. Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982 when 11servicemen were fatally wounded in two bombings in central London.The music school trains young recruits for the seven RoyalMarines bands. Up to 250 young men, most ages 16 to 20, undergomilitary and musical training there, working with older,professional bandsmen.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saidMonday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the RoyalMarines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week aremonsters who will be found and punished.The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murdererswho must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for avery long time, she said following a tour of the school's wreckedbarracks in Deal, southeast England.We lost 10 remarkable musicians, not fighting men, justbecause some people try to bomb others out of their democraticviews, she said. They are very evil people, absolute monsters.Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political arm ofthe IRA, issued a statement disputing Mrs. Thatcher's remarks,saying she knows in her heart of hearts the real nature of theconflict, its cause and the remedy.The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland andunite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman CatholicRepublic of Ireland.We want an end to all violent deaths arising out of thepresent relationship between our two countries, Adams said. Wewant a new peaceful relationship based on an acceptance and respectfor our rights as a sovereign nation.After visiting some of the 11 injured bandsmen still in thehospital, Mrs. Thatcher pledged: The hunt for the bombers will bepursued with all possible speed, vigor and dedication.Raymond Kendall, the secretary-general of the internationalpolice organization Interpol, pledged the organization's fullsupport in the hunt for those who blew up the school.I hope we will have a part to play in finding them, saidKendall after opening the International Police Exhibition andConference in London.They are criminals of the worst sort and should be dealt withas such.Before landing in Deal, Mrs. Thatcher's helicopter flew over therubble that had been the band's recreation center.The IRA claimed responsibility for the explosion, and policesaid they are looking for three men with Irish accents who rented ahouse overlooking the barracks.Neighbors were breakfasting, heading to workor asleep in bed when an explosion at a military barracks turnedtheir homes to rubble and they were confronted with the sight ofbodies being carried away.There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz.After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me, said JoanBetteridge, a pensioner in the southern England town of Deal, wherethe blast at the Royal Marines School of Music occurred.The Irish Republican Army claimed reponsibilty for the explosion,which police said killed 11 people and injured 22.Nearby resident Sean Minnock said: I was asleep but woke upwith a hell of a jolt ... the bedroom ceiling fell in on me. I woketo find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor.From the wrecked, smoke-clouded barracks, I could hearterrified screams of agony. People started rushing about all overthe place. It was horrible to watch and listen to, said Minnock,28.I knew people had been seriously hurt. I saw the rescuers pullout two bodies. I knew they were dead when they put them on thefloor and put bed blankets right over them.Minnock's wife, Janet, said the roof of their house was torn offand all the back windows were shattered.The house has been blown to bits, she said.Mrs. Minnock was feeding her 2-year-old son Thomas his breakfastwhen the explosion wrecked four terraced houses in the streetbacking onto the barracks.Her next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, 26, was standing at herkitchen window facing the barracks, holding her 4-month-old son Lukein her arms. Her other boys, Ben, 3, and Joshua, 2, were at her side.I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole buildingexplode, she said. I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned asliver of glass embedded itself in his back.The whole window was blown across the kitchen. I just screamedand ran out of the room. The bang was so loud I thought the wholehouse was coming in.At first I thought for sure Joshua had been seriously injured.There was blood coming out of his back. Doctors removed the glassand sent him home.College student Simon Mitford, 17, narrowly escaped being injuredin the explosion because he got up earlier than usual.His room was completely wrecked by the blast, his brotherAlex said.Of the barracks, he said: I heard music playing and then itwent bang and there was glass everywhere. It was a two-storybuilding but now 90 percent of it is rubble.I heard a marine scream out, `The band is under there.' I wasscared there was going to be a second explosion.Prince Philip on Sunday condemned thesenseless killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in an IRAbombing, and Britain's defense secretary said he warned allmilitary bases of the risk of similar attacks.Clergyman urged relatives and friends of dead and maimedmusicians to forgive the bombers. Only forgiveness breaks the tiebetween the hater and the hated, the Rev. George Lings toldmourners.The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and captain general ofthe Royal Marines, visited injured men in the hospital and touredthe severely damaged Royal Marines School of Music in Deal,southeast Britain.It will not help the IRA win anything, said Philip, who worea Royal Marines tie. It is senseless. One simply wonders whatsort of mentality can even contemplate such meaningless acts. It isappalling.He paid tribute to the 12 injured men, five of whom werecritically wounded.The prince was accompanied by Viscountess Mountbatten, daughterof Lord Mountbatten, who was killed by an IRA bomb on his boat in1979. Mountbatten was India's last viceroy and a cousin of thequeen.British military installations are a frequent target of theIrish Republican Army in its campaign to end British rule inNorthern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant provincewith the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.Defense Secretary Tom King said Sunday he has issued an alert toall military installations to prevent other attacks. He would notgive details.The perpetrators of the latest outrage are at large and thereis a risk of other attacks, King said. That is why we aretaking a number of other steps.King defended the use of private security firms hired to guardthe Deal school and 29 other low-risk military installations inBritain. Local residents and grieving relatives have said securitywas lax and should be turned back to the marines. King said theprivate firms will remain.It is important to remember that what we need in these casesare eyes and ears and observation, King said on BritishBroadcasting Corp. radio.Private security guards can be a very useful additionalassistance. They also help to reduce the amount of time soldiershave to spend on what is not the most enjoyable part of theiractivity.At church services throughout the small port, clergymen urgedmourners to pray for and forgive the bombers.The Rev. Charles Howard, a Royal Navy chaplain, asked the300-member congregation inside the barracks, if you can find roomin your hearts ... pray for the men who perpetrated this terribleact, that God will soften their hearts and turn them from theirviolent and evil ways.Many cried as Howard read aloud the names of the 10 servicemenkilled during a coffee break between band practices. It was theworst IRA attack on the British mainland since July 1982.At nearby St. George's Church, formerly the Royal Marines'church, Lings said, no one says forgiveness is easy; no one saysthe terrorist deserves forgiveness.But ... forgive them, they not what they do.An explosion today flattened a militarybarracks and tore through nearby homes, killing 11 people andinjuring 22, police said. The IRA claimed responsibility for theblast.More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubbleof a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines Schoolof Music near Deal. Stunned neighbors gathered outside homes thatwere damaged or destroyed.Chief Police Inspector Alan Butterfield of Kent, who who providedthe casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort, firstreported that one person was missing but later said everyone wasaccounted for.He said many of the injured were seriously hurt.There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz.After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me, saidpensioner Joan Betteridge.Defense Secretary Tom King, inspecting the wreckage, said: Itis not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb, but all theevidence is quite clearly that this is an IRA atrocity.British military installations are a frequent bombing target ofthe Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland ofBritish rule, but today's explosion in the coastal town 70 milessoutheast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainlandin more than seven years.The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in thebarracks. One of the bands had just stopped playing on the paradeground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keepingwith British custom.Dozens of homes near the school were damaged, including four thatwere destroyed. Witnesses reported hearing the explosion two milesaway.The Defense Ministry would not say how many servicemen andcivilians were included in the casualty figures. However, King toldreporters the attack was directed against unarmed bandsmen.Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras tosearch through the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman KevinSimmons.Ten doctors were giving emergency treatment at the scene and 11ambulances were taking the injured to two hospitals, the ambulanceservice said.A statement telephoned to Ireland International, a Dublin newsagency, said we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent inresponse to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to NorthernIreland nine days ago.The IRA said Mrs. Thatcher went to the British province with amessage of war, but we still want peace and we want the Britishgovernment to leave our country. It was signed P. O'Neill, a nomde guerre the IRA usually uses to claim responsibility for actionsoutside Northern Ireland.Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey issued a statement in Dublincondemning the attack, calling it an outrage.The last IRA bomb attempt on the British mainland was in Februarywhen about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks inShropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded. Onesoldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA bomb attack on an armybarracks in north London in August 1988.In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near theHousehold Cavalry barracks in central London and at a bandstand inthe capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing. Threepeople died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings.The music school is the training center for young recruits whowant to play in the seven Royal Marines bands. Up to 250 young men,most between 16 and 20, are based at the school, where they receivemilitary and musical training.The roof of Janet Minnock's house was torn off by the force ofthe blast and all the back windows were shattered.The house has been blown to bits, she said. We are allshaken up.Mrs. Minnock's next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, said she wasstanding at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time ofthe explosion.

54,d062j,"Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake. Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month. The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claims division. But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers. Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains. Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage. Most insurers already have mobilized their ""catastrophe"" teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California. Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area. About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks. Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers. Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo. State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California. Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement ""rider"" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes. State Farm said about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance. Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., said about 23% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28% in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage. The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million is insured, it said. Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today. They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two. Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage. Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage. Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds. However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have ""loss of income"" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days. That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia. Earthquake-related claims aren't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole. Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear. Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways. For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy. Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise. Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves. ""We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace,"" said William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry. His firm, along with some others, issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday. Among the insurance stocks, big gainers included American International Group, up $3.25 to $102.625; General Re Corp., up $2.75 to $86.50; Aetna, up $2.375 to $59.50; and Marsh & McLennan Inc., up $3.125 to $75.875. Still, a few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated. ""I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this,"" said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult. He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo. British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster. Although it's unclear how much exposure the London market will face, U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage. Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar. The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire. Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion. He is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo.The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly. In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning. Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action. Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now. So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu. By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who was in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters. Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism. On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be ""less carping"" about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency ""took a hit"" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo. The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend. He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so.Most San Francisco-area homeowners mayhave to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their ownpockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits fromhigher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.Only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowners haveearthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percentdeductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000home, according to industry spokesmen.The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento saidthat in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of thehomes have earthquake insurance. The organization estimatedresidential damages from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million inthe Bay area, with between $100 million to $150 million insured.Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will getreimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which iscovered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn,director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss ResearchBureau in Schaumburg, Ill.Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount ofquake-related damages they're likely to have to pay. In addition tohome damage, the companies likely will get claims for automobiledamage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption dueto electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workerscompensation.Some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling $1billion or more from the quake. But industry observers said theydon't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage fromquake-related claims.We don't think any company is going to have problems payingclaims, said Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for theAmerican Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group.The insurers actually could benefit. Industry analysts predictedinsurers would be able to reverse three years of declining ratesand win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damagesand the estimated $4 billion in damages from Hurricane Hugo, whichhammered South Carolina and other parts of the southeastern UnitedStates earlier this month.An increase in insurance rates could translate into greaterprofitability in the long term, the analysts said.There's a perception that this could turn the cycle ... thatthis could be enough to firm pricing, said Gloria L. Vogel, ananalyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. in New York.Despite their predictions for the long run, the analysts warnedthat fourth-quarter earnings among insurance companies are likelyto be disappointing.It's going to be a meaningful loss, perhaps as big as Hugo,said Robert Glasspiegel, an analyst with Hartford-based LangenMcAlenney.On the New York Stock Exchange, some insurance company stockrose on Wednesday. Aetna Life & Casualty Co. rose $2.37{ to $59.50a share; ITT Corp., parent of The Hartford, was up 37{ cents to$59; and the Travelers Cos. rose $1 to $40.87{.Reinsurance companies, which absorb risk from policy writers,did especially well. General Re Corp. rose $2.75 to $86.50 andMarsh & McLennan Cos. rose $3.12{ to $75.87{.In California, earthquake insurance is an emotional andpolitically-charged issue. Roughly two-thirds of all insurancepolicies written in the United States are sold in California, wheremany of the nation's most damaging earthquakes have occurred..Under a 1985 California law, insurers are required to offerearthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not requiredto buy the coverage.Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance tocommercial property owners, but the percentage of business propertywith the coverage is very high, industry spokesmen said. Theyestimated that at least 25 percent, and probably many more,business properties are insured.Because of its high costs, earthquake insurance has become atarget of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by Californiavoters last year. The proposition calls for a 20 percent rollbackin insurance rates.

55,d066j,"SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation. Theson of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store inwhat was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters ofArkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it theworld's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton familyprobably America's richest.Wal-Mart now operates in 43 US states, selling goods ranging from detergentsto golf clubs.The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality andwillingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.He was a frugal, modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartanroom in his Bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of theoffice to tour stores and meet customers and staff, whom he insisted oncalling 'associates.'He would deliver pep-talks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift andcustomer satisfaction, long before these became fashionable managementbuzz-words.Employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptancein US service industries - was also a vital ingredient in the Waltonphilosophy.He buoyed staff morale with cheer-leading sessions, bonus payments for goodperformance and profit-sharing plans which allowed some employees of verymodest means to retire relatively wealthy.Eight years ago, when Wal-Mart's profits were better than expected, he kepta promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on WallStreet.Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume,cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic saleswhich rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty.'Low prices always' became Wal-Mart's motto.Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount storescould not operate successfully in the small, rural towns of the US south.It was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business,though in the process Wal-Mart put out of business hundreds of small mainstreet stores, prompting bitter resistance in some towns which Mr Waltontended to blunt with generous charitable donations.Forty years after Sam Walton first hungout his shingle, Walton's 5&10 will reopen to show how a littlerural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in thesame building on the downtown square where Walton first opened forbusiness on May 9, 1950.The center chronicles the rise of the nation's fastest-growingdiscount chain, using displays and audio-video presentations. Itconcentrates on how the free enterprise system works and howWal-Mart thrived when similar companies didn't.The window displays date back to the store's opening, withSimplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and someIvory Snow. Inside, an electronic map details the company's1,500-plus store chain today.Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Waltondonned for his dance on Wall Street, which he performed afterchallenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profitin 1984. The goal was accomplished and he danced.The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture ofthe nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. ofDetroit.Walton and his brother, Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart DiscountCity in 1962. Both will be on hand for the opening, along with asprinkling of other dignitaries, including Gov. Bill Clinton, thededication speaker.Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center alsohas a replica of Sam Walton's original office at the store,including many fixtures he used 40 years ago.Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton, a fat-facedbaby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s. Typical of the Wal-Martoutlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed a place to grow and todream in a video on the Walton family.After a stint with J.C. Penney Co. and the Army, he opened a BenFranklin store in Newport in 1945. He lost the lease on that one,and relocated to Bentonville. That's where the story took off.Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, totake over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955.Walton said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores andneeded someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and hisbrother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recentinterview.That's when Bogle found himself in Walton's learn as you gotraining program.I got home at 10 o'clock that night after scrubbing and waxingthe floor with Sam, Bogle said.Inauspicious first impressions are part of the story. In onevideo, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive ofWal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impressions after attending theopening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.The first store, at Rogers, opened two years earlier.I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discountstore, or retail store, I have ever seen, said Glass, who waspresident of a drugstore chain at the time.And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that whenWalton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas toBen Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there just reallydidn't see a future in it.Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and publicaffairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its associates  theterm for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Martemployees are partners in the company  and to Sam Walton'sleadership and knack for hiring the right person at the righttime.At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores, employed272,000 and listed sales of $25.8 billion. Sam's Wholesale Clubclosed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans toenter the California market.MADE IN AMERICA: MY STORYBy Sam WaltonDoubleday, Dollars 22.50. 269 pagesBeing an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot found out.The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strapentrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright. In a country where businesspractices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve. Avast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who diedof cancer in April, negotiated these pitfalls much better than most. When,in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, thepaparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied bychicken farmers, where Walton made his home. What they found was a happilymarried, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted atthe local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus twohub-caps. Folksy was an understatement.Since then, some aspects of Wal-Mart's business - its anti-union policies,the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops -have been subject to critical scrutiny. So, to an extent, have the lesswholesome adventures of the four Walton children. But no one has ever beenable to make Sam himself look bad. The worst that has been said is that hewas rather dull.Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions. Readers will either find hisautobiography lashed with 'good ol common-sense and a lot of harmless, ifcharming, anecdotes. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makesno excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at onestage, 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate .. . .'A few snippets are more revealing about the character. There cannot be manybillionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - andhave the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.Meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his businessis inescapable. In one of many contributions from friends and family, DonSoderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells of finding Sam oneSaturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysinghis rival's stock. And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when thecouple was on holiday in Italy their luggage vanished while her husband wasoff on a similar scouting mission.But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhapscaptures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best. Explaining the annualcontest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' topromote, he recalls the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow bucketsfor carrying bait. Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice. 'So Iwould go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . .put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnowbucket. I particularly did it in stores I knew (Sam) was going to visit. Itdrove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half thetruth. Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packagedhimself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southernsweet called Moon Pies.For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.Occasionally, it just grates. 'I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for aboutabout Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, 'just a little old bankwith only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits. But it helped me learn a lot aboutfinancing things.' Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - whenWalton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have writtenthis book'. Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, hecan hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it. But these are unlikely to becircumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis. At the end ofthe day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores.The store manager of the Wal-Mart in thiscommunity on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives aninsight into the man considered responsible for a retailingphenomenon.Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretarytelephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters inBentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearbyairport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bringhim to the De Soto store.Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept inclose touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed byother Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot oftime in the field.Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallasmetropolitan area, It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,'because they're always out.By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operationsthroughout the company.Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating OfficerDavid Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote thegospel according to Sam, as he is called.To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing, Rule No.1 isthe customer is always right. Rule No.2 says just in case thecustomer's wrong, revert to rule No.1.If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they arebecause that's the way Sam is, people who know him say.He shuns the limelight that his company's success has shed on himand has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart associates thathospitality to customers is crucial. He preaches it in person or viahigh-tech satellite hookup with his stores.Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a companyeffort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a unionorganizing effort in the late 1960s.One of the most sensitive subjects for Walton is the fortune he'samassed.A close associate says Sam would probably give anything notto be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiestpeople. The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stakein Wal-Mart stock is worth about $6.8 billion.Sam Walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in hisbank account, says Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.Samuel Moore Walton turns 71 on March 29. He was born inKingfisher, Okla., and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker.He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economicsdegree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee inDes Moines, Iowa. After serving three years in the Army, he went toArkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventuallybecoming the company's biggest franchisee.The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and hisbrother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S.retail trade.Bud is a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.Three of the four grown children Sam and his wife Helen had areinvolved with the company in various capacities.Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much asever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout withleukemia, now in remission. He spends less time in the office sincehanding over most responsiblities to David Glass. Sam is stillchairman of the board.Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourishwithout Sam. The answer is an emphatic yes because, he says, Wehave great people. The Walton family will always be involved, headds.Commenting on the future, Glass says: We'll be judged on whatwe produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past won'tmatter.Wal-Mart founder Sam Waltonpitched in to help check-out clerks at his store in this FloridaPanhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cashregisters.The 71-year-old Walton, considered to be one of the world'srichest people, grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and startedhand-writing merchandise prices for customers so their bills couldbe tallied on calculators quickly.People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him,said store manager Paul Sively. He shook their hands and talked toeveryone he could. The registers were out for about 45 minutes, andI don't think we had one customer complain.Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit tothe store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer JanaJea in its parking lot. Walton often attends promotional events forhis Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said he had suspected the bossmight make an appearance.Walton continued talking with customers during the concert. Healso joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers inthe Wal-Mart cheer.He was up there saying, `Give me a W, give me an A,' and thecustomers went right along with him, Sively said. He even gotdown to do a cheerleader's squiggle.'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vanceand Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pagesMany people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream;few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boywho became one of the world's most successful businessmen. The church-goingson of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a storechain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before hisdeath in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and afterWalton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four childrenheld between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth. AlthoughWalton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discountstore.At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets withsales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal DiscountMerchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers. Ten yearslater, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggestretailer in the US. Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of SearsRoebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest. Withinanother 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death,however, published material about the company is curiously scarce. This bookattempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise ofWal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaininghow it was achieved.One strength the authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adaptfrom other retailers.Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing. Rather, he realised the threatdiscounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depthmany of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann andHope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount storesinto small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travellinglong distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby sellingeverything they needed.Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology. As early as the1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought asmall aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued todo to the end of his life.Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to bepersuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs -long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to investDollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system. This technologyhelped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of anyretailer. But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the booksuggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive managementstructure.Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in Bentonville,Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, are despatched everyMonday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visiting stores, workingwith staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meetingevery Friday.They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30ammeeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers torelate the results. District managers hold a conference call with theirstore managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting havebeen communicated to all store department heads.The system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one weekand, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see its implementationbegin the following week.Even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however. One wasWalton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's rolein 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins. Another wasWal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even forgigantist America.Then there was Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street ifWal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984. It did, andhe did.The book also covers well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on theeconomies of small US towns was positive or negative.If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quitecaptures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growingretailer. Moreover, it makes little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart cancontinue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way itconquered the US.But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success inbuilding his own American dream.He's ranked as the richest man in thenation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville,a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.He's just a part of the community, said Curt Loyd, executivedirector of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce. He's a neatperson. He calls Bentonville home, and that is special to us.Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Martstores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is againshunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among theworld's top billionaires. According to Forbes magazine's July 24edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, upfrom its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.He is unavailable, said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of thesilver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain,based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Mondaymorning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers. Shinkle saidnews coverage about Walton usually sets off a press frenzy forcomments from him. But the 71-year-old businessman declined tocomment.He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual andhe prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,Shinkle said.He very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings. It justputs him in a position he doesn't want to be.But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personalmodesty. Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton'sfamily-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, hequipped in response to questions at a news conference on anothertopic that it was only paper. Walton then changed the subject.Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man inOctober 1985. Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world'swealthiest people. Walton made that listing as the richest Americanevery year since. This year he ranks third, behind two Japanesebusinessmen.Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a singlefive-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago. He is out of theoffice up to four days a week, the spokesman said.He spends most of his time talking to associates andcustomers, Shinkle said, and he always comes back with manyideas from them.Wal-Mart calls its sales help associates instead of employees.When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans,recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came infrom all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.They wanted to know about the stock and the company, saidSimpson, who works for Stephens Inc. You'd think that he'd beliving in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas. But now peoplejust accept it.When it comes out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,'Simpson said.","FT922-14265,AP900507-0207,FT923-5068,AP890323-0234,AP890615-0263,FT944-12170,AP890711-0223","Sam Walton, Wal-Mart's multi-billionaire ""good 'ole boy"", revolutionized American retailing.","Sam Walton revolutionized discount retailing, at the same time becoming the richest man in America.

56,d067f,"SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-battered Louisiana yesterday tobegin a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Andrew had flattened wholedistricts, killing two people and injuring dozens more, agencies report fromFlorida and New Orleans.However, local officials in Florida, hit earlier in the week by thehurricane, were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food,drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need.Federal emergency officials acknowledged distribution problems,Transportation Secretary Andrew Card yesterday promised 'dramatic'improvements within 24 hours and President George Bush last night orderedtroops to Florida, without specifying a number.The government estimated it would cost Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy andrebuild in Florida, and to care for residents displaced by the storm.Louisiana state officials said they had no overall count of storm-relatedinjuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer than 100. The FederalEmergency Management Agency said it was setting aside Dollars 77m to helpLouisiana recover.Most of the storm's fury was spent against sparsely populated farmingcommunities and swampland in the state, sparing it the widespreaddestruction caused in Florida, where 15 people died.Official estimates in Miami reported that the hurricane had wiped out thehomes of one Dade County resident in eight - a quarter of a million people.Andrew had become little more than a strong rainstorm early yesterday,moving across Mississippi state and heading for the north-eastern US.Several of Louisiana's main industries were affected, including those ofoysters and alligators. Wildlife and fisheries secretary Joe Herringestimated a 50 per cent decline in the alligator industry. The cotton andsugar-cane crops were threatened, the state agriculture department said.Most Louisiana oil refineries, however, were barely affected and deliveriesof crude oil were expected to resume yesterday.HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in UShistory, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana,inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing thelow-lying city of New Orleans.The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headednorth-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesdaynight some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajuncountry.Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday wasmuch greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely tototal less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a seniormember of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles perhour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City,Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 mileswest of New Orleans.Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterdayafternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustainedwindspeeds were below 75 mph.Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured andthousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deathsin Florida and three in the Bahamas.The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refiningindustry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity wascut.The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, saidthat damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bnof damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property,he said.In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whosebasement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile bandacross Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical housesells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a billin respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees andshrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has beenbadly damaged, a Holiday Inn.Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday andhealth officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat allwater.Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost theinsurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may haveraised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it wasestimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this centurythreatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.Government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advisedor ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas.The hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causingbillions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterdaywas moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140miles an hour.At least three people died on Sunday when Hurricane Andrew crossed theBahamas.Ms Kate Hale, director of emergency services in Florida's Dade County, whichbore the brunt of the storm, estimated that Andrew had already causedDollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 7.5bn-Pounds 10bn) of damage.However, insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early toassess the costs accurately. The US industry's Property Claims Service, theofficial compiler of disaster losses, had yet to compile a preliminary tallyof the Florida bill.A hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along 470 miles of Gulf coastfrom Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Galvestone, Texas.Several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in centralLouisiana, to the west of New Orleans, possibly late last night or thismorning.New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable becausethe city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through itscentre and a large lake immediately to the north.Much of America's oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal Texasand Louisiana and several refineries were yesterday partially shut down.These included British Petroleum's Belle Chasse plant in Louisiana.In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some10-15 miles south of Miami. The town of Homestead, near the centre of thestorm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base.Miami's city centre escaped with relatively light damage. More than 24 hoursafter the hurricane, some 825,000 households and businesses were stillwithout power.The brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the USindustry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State FarmGroup and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck. These are also theleading property/casualty and home insurance groups in Louisiana, togetherwith American International Group.A spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company hadroughly 20 per cent of the Florida market. The mutually-owned company has noreinsurance. Its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and itsreserves, at about Dollars 24bn, have made it unnecessary.According to Balcombe Group, a UK-based claims adjustment firm, otherinsurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are HartfordInsurance, Aetna and Travellers. Travellers said it had flown 50 claimsadjusters in to Florida late on Monday and was assessing losses. About 12per cent of Travellers' home insurance premium income came from Florida lastyear, and 4.6 per cent of its commercial insurance premiums.The last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989,cost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of thetotal damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn.US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were onstorm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping acrosssouthern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage.The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first tohit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, governmentspokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlyingeastern islands.Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, saidtotal losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims weretaken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big UShurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989.The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers,industry analysts said yesterday.Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-MarineAssociation, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, theLloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsuranceof reinsurance risk  - known as the retrocession market  - has shrunkconsiderably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of theirrisks through Lloyd's.Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimatedthat mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims sofar.'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, headded, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters.Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m.Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may facelosses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5mand Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each.However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across theGulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towardsNew Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flooddamage.Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabamaport of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night orearly Thursday.It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil productionfacilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution.A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on theGulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewingemergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations.Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coastof Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs offhouses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted treesbefore heading out over the Gulf.A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida asthe hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power andLight company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, werewithout power.Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables,just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Itsradar and satellite antennae were blown away.President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areasand made plans for an inspection tour of the state.Picture, Page 14GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insuranceclaims arising from Hurricane Andrew could 'cost it as much as Dollars 40m.'Lord Airlie, the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders'meeting, said: 'On the basis of emerging information, General Accidentadvise that the losses to their US operations arising from Hurricane Andrew,which struck Florida and Louisiana, might in total reach the level at whichexternal catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed'.What this means is that GA is able to pass on its losses to externalreinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached.It believes this threshold may be breached in respect of Hurricane Andrewclaims.However, if this happens, it would suffer a post-tax loss of Dollars 40m(Pounds 20m).Mr Nelson Robertson, GA's chief general manager, explained later that thecompany has a  1/2 per cent share of the Florida market. It has a branch inOrlando.The company's loss adjusters are in the area trying to estimate the losses.Their guess is that losses to be faced by all insurers may total more thanDollars 8bn.Not all damaged property in the area is insured and there have beenestimates that the storm caused more than Dollars 20bn of damage.However, other insurers have estimated that losses could be as low asDollars 1bn in total.Mr Robertson said: 'No one knows at this time what the exact loss is'.WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southernFlorida and Louisiana this week, a grade two dollar crisis (on a one-to-fourscale, four being most severe) was blowing itself out at the end of atumultuous few days for US and world financial markets.On Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted aweek ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yields jumped sharplyand the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points.The flimsy walls erected hastily by the Federal Reserve and other bigcentral banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of sellingon foreign exchange markets failed to hold; and as the sellers pouredthrough the breached barricades, the currency dropped to DM1.40. This wasits lowest-ever point against the D-mark.The conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up incurrency markets for some time. Interest rate differentials between US andGermany widened over the summer as the Fed eased, and the Bundesbanktightened, their respective monetary policies.The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour wasalso making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding thedollar.So, too, was the political hole President Bush had dug for himself in are-election battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shoo-in for theincumbent.Moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in themarkets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreignexchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction  - down.While there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar, thelogic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets wasless obviously compelling.There are two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices tofall. The first is that it raises import prices and, as a result, adds toinflationary pressures.The second is that it makes it hard for the Fed to engineer another cut ininterest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery, and raises thepossibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency.The first explanation is not particularly convincing - imports account fornot much more than 10 per cent of US gross domestic product, so higherimport prices do not greatly effect the overall price level, which is nowaround 3 per cent and heading lower.The second explanation carries more weight. Although there is not muchchance, given the present economic and political climate, that the Fed willraise rates to help the dollar, there is little doubt that the currency'sweakness makes it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policyagain.The fear that the Fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the presenteconomic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets. But investorsin stocks were equally, if not more, troubled by the rise in bond yields.Just over a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which hasremained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy,looked as if it might drop below 7.3 per cent.The dollar put paid to those hopes and, by the middle of this week, it wasapproaching 7.45 per cent, putting an upward pressure on the all-importantmortgage rate for home-buyers.The dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week, and thedevastating effect of Hurricane Andrew produced a typically hard-eyed,although nonetheless logical, reaction from Wall Street.The stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure insouthern Florida, the area hit worst by the hurricane, all took a tumble.But the relatively modest losses in Geico, Travelers and Progressivesuggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsuredadequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims.The flip side of the hurricane's coin was a strong showing from the stocksof home construction companies expected to benefit from demand forrebuilding damaged or destroyed homes. Since there are an estimated 250,000people left homeless by the storm, there is a lot of work to be done.The biggest gains among construction stocks this week were posted by Lennar,Oakwood Homes, Engle Homes and Fleetwood, the largest maker ofpre-manufactured homes in the US.","FT923-5797,FT923-6038,FT923-6110,FT923-6455,FT923-5835,FT923-5589",Insurers face large claims from Hurricane Andrew's assault on the south.,"Hurricane Andrew caused about $20 billion damage.

57,d065j,"Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination wassupposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator,but the dream faded overnight.Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed toignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack ofinspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his militaryrecord and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans bywithdrawing from the ticket.Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quaylemanaged to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech aboutfamily, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bushadministration.Let's go on to victory! Quayle exhorted, as the crowderupted in cheers.The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calmself-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding hispenchant for extemporaneous remarks  perhaps another result of theunanticipated controversy.Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he wasproud to have Dan Quayle at my side. The two will stress theunity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekendthrough Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.But beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrentthat threatened Quayle's candidacy just as it was launched.Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi  who worked for Quayle'sgrandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of TheIndianapolis News  said he contacted the National Guard on behalfof Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and recommended himvery highly, the News reported.Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guardduty so he could attend law school. A Bush aide said the matter wasdiscussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led tohis selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that heused influence to gain admittance to the Guard.Bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping Quaylefrom the ticket, as some Republicans suggested. Quayle was tenseand refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during abrief walk-through at the convention hall.It was a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor,rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have beencompared to those of John F. Kennedy.Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech,saying he was proud of the six years he served. He also addressedhis relative anonymity: Many this week have asked, `Who is DanQuayle?' The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will.Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled outtheir ammunition. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle's namein nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflectconcerns that he lacked experience for the job.He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator. ...That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis,and he is running for president, Dole said.Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded thenomination, said Quayle would bring vim, vigor and vitality tothe party and would bring sparks and voltage to this campaign.Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start on the nationalticket remains to be seen. Others, notably Democratic vicepresidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, found they couldnot.But Quayle, ever upbeat, was determined Thursday night not to bedaunted by the prospect. Miracles do happen, he told his party.Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated forvice president and already Republicans are comparing him to ThomasJefferson and John F. Kennedy.Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senatesubcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indianasenator speak, I'd say, `there stands the next ThomasJefferson.'And, added Warner, he does have the same fire in his belly asour great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, aDemocrat.In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy forpresident and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle, saidFord. John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 yearsbefore he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years.What Quayle thinks of those references isn't known. But hedoesn't like it when people say he looks like movie idol RobertRedford.Whether, indeed, he looks like Redford seems to be in the eye ofthe beholder. In the parlance of politics, it's an issue. They areboth male. They are both blond.The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage. The actor, who onceplayed the role of a presidential office seeker in TheCandidate sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop thelook-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, andafter he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.And this week, he told reporters he considered the so-calledRedford look a stigma. He wasn't asked how he felt about beingpainted as another Jefferson or Kennedy.Meanwhile, fellow senators were trying to publicize Quayle who,at 41, hasn't had a chance to become a legend. He is a Republicanvice presidential candidate who is not, as Spiro Agnew once said ofhimself, a household word.To help him get known, eight fellow senators Wednesday tookturns telling reporters how much they liked him.We know him well, said Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive becauseof his enthusiasm, said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 years of age, he's goingto send a message to the American people that the Republican Partyrespects young people who achieve, said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senators said that should nothold him back.Let's not start this business of who's wealthy, Sen. AlfonseD'Amato, R-N.Y.Dan Quayle's sister believes the Indianasenator won't let his candidacy for vice president hurt the familylife he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy.I don't think it will be tough on the family, said MarthaSaddler, Quayle's sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind. Sincehe's been in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hecticschedule and wonder how he does it. But he does it and loves it.The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoonafter George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indianasenator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator andhis wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years inpublic life.Dan and Marilyn Quayle met as law students in Indianapolis,married while they were still in school and remain close to many oftheir friends from that period.One of the greatest things about him is the job of being asenator has not changed him a bit, said Indianapolis attorneyWilliam R. Neale, treasurer of Quayle's 1986 re-election campaign.He's the same nice guy he was in law school.Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis,introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering atthe Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.Dan Quayle, who grew up in Huntington, graduated from DePauwUniversity, a small liberal arts college in Greencastle, Ind.,before going to work in the Indiana attorney general's office in1970.Daniel F. Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, saidhe doesn't expect Quayle's national candidacy to change him.I think his strength is he'll remember who his friends areeven after this, said Evans, who was chairman of Quayle's 1986campaign.Friends said the Quayles are devoted to their three children andprefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in Washington.His family looks like the family both parties are trying toappeal to, said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in theWhite House and now president of the Hudson Institute. It's abeautiful family. I think they'll be a real asset.The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker;a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne.When they campaign in Indiana, the Quayles often tour in twogroups  the boys riding in parades with Marilyn Quayle and Corinneand her father visiting county fairs.The kids are nonchalant, normal kids, said Mrs. Saddler.They take it in stride and play.In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles saidthey had worried during the vice presidential speculation about thefamily's loss of privacy during a national campaign.The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,said Mrs. Quayle, 39.Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whetherhe should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it.Tucker was fascinated by the idea, Quayle said. Benjamin wasambiguous but he thought Secret Service agents might be able tohelp him on tests at school, Mrs. Quayle said.Corinne didn't like the prospect of having her father spend moretime away from home, Quayle said.She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks BobDole,' said Quayle.Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen.Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vicepresident at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.Thank you. Thank you.Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are herefor the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the UnitedStates.We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in theRepublican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, thejunior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.You know, senators get a lot of mail. Party leaders more thanmost. And almost every one of these letters asks for help with someproblem.Well, three years ago, I received a handwritten plea from a6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senatesessions had a very special problem.She wrote, and I quote: I have my second-grade play tonight.Please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me.I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because sheinvited me to come along, too.Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother,Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the UnitedStates Senate.Dan Quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted familyman.And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the toughvotes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into thelaw of the land.Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INFtreaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunchsupporter of the Reagan revolution. And now he is ready to carrythat revolution forward.And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try touse experience as a measuring stick in this campaign. Just let themtry.Now, I don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacksexperience. He's got plenty of experience, plenty of experience experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoingthe pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience inincreasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts.And I just don't believe the American people want that kind ofexperience in the White House.It sounds like a Dukak-eyed idea to me.But Dan Quayle's got experience, too. He's already spent 12years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital nationaland international issues that affect the lives of all Americans andthe future of our country.That is 12 more years of national experience than MichaelDukakis  and he is running for president.As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust. Iam honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr. Chairman.And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of mytime to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my goodfriend, Sen. Dick Lugar.He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even asthe world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebratinghis life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan QuayleMemorabilia Exhibit.; To those who say Quayle does not merit his ownexhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that heis, after all, the vice president of the United States.; ""We're preservinghistory,"" says David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator. ""A century from nowsomeone may want to do a dissertation on him.""; If so, Huntington will beready.; Relatives, former classmates and longtime neighbors of Quayle havedonated yearbooks, report cards, poems, letters, his Little League uniform, acoffee cup he drank from, a chair he once stood on during the 1988presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched, wrote,signed or posed for.; The vice president's mother, Corinne, donated a lockof his baby hair. The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture ofQuayle, then an aide to Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb, accompanying her to therace. And a former housekeeper turned in a 20-year-old piece of carpeting shesaved from one of Quayle's floors.; The exhibition, which runs through May20, was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation, a sort offan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of thenation's 44th and, they say, least-understood vice president.; ""He hastaken such a bad rap,"" said Schenkel, a foundation board member. ""If peopleknew him, they'd see he's a regular person. If they had a chance to sit downwith Dan as a neighbor, they would see the extremely good values in the man."";These are the faithful, who have long since stopped expecting ""good press""on their man. Instead they measure news reports on him by their relativenegativity, describing the best coverage as ""more upbeat"" or ""halfwaydecent.""; They defend the relatively young age of Quayle, who turned 44 inFebruary (""All he needs is a little seasoning""); his limited experience (""Lookat what they said about Truman -- he was a haberdasher""), and his passion forgolf (""He has to have some form of relaxation""). But they are careful not tostretch the superlatives. The description ""nice"" comes up a lot.; ""He's notthe fool that the talk show hosts think he is,"" says Dottie Watson, presidentof the Republican Women of Huntington County. ""He's a very nice person, acapable person. Everybody I know says he can do it.""; That is not to saysome people don't have some friendly advice for Quayle. ""If he would slowdown, talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying, I don't thinkpeople would take him the way they do,"" said Jean Anne Drabenstot, the ownerof Nick's Kitchen, Quayle's favorite restaurant.; Hayden Schenkel, chairmanof the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of DavidSchenkel, says, ""Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentallybecame president of the United States. Most of the Democrats and even some ofthe Republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him as vicepresident, and they're 100 percent behind him. But in all due respect, we surehope nothing happens to President Bush.""; Quayle has declined an invitationto attend the tribute, citing a busy schedule. Nonetheless, most ofHuntington's 17,000 residents have rallied around their native son for theexhibition, which tracks his life from infancy through law school, from theSenate to the vice presidency.; The free exhibition has turned a gray roomin the town's public library into a virtual Dan Quayle museum. The displaypatches together pieces of a life that until the last decade was strikinglyordinary.; There is Dan Quayle and his brother Chris riding horseback andwearing cowboy hats, or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas atChristmas. There is Dan Quayle with his Vacation Bible School class, DanQuayle with the high school golf team, Dan Quayle at 5 or 6 years of age withSharon McEachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival atthe Fort Wayne Country Club. It is all very 50s, very Middle American, almostsurreal in its innocence.; There are windows into the workings of theQuayle family, too. For example, his father, James, signed the report cardswhen Dan brought home poor grades, and his mother signed when he brought homegood ones.; And there are letters and poems that he wrote, which only go toshow that one does not have to be a Yeats to make it in politics. Dan wrotethis rather thoughtful verse on Nov. 22, 1960, when he was 13 years old:;My Dad is very very nice; But he is not made of sugar and spice.;Sometimes he acts as if he has been disturbed; But at other times he is ascheerful as a bird.; The exhibit also includes the 1972 newspaperannouncement of Dan and Marilyn Quayle's wedding, the wooden ""Quayle & Quayle""shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here, and assortedcampaign souvenirs, including the official air sickness bag from the 1988Republican National Convention.; Ultimately, the foundation wants to builda repository for the memorabilia. It has already organized a walking tour ofhistoric Quayle sites, like the white, ranch-style house where he spent hisearly days, and Nick's Kitchen, where he likes to order tenderloins, fries anda milkshake.; ""We want everybody to know he's a winner -- I don't care whatthe newspapers say,"" said Marge Hiner, one of the exhibit organizers. ""What arole model for our children, to know that you can be a normal person, comefrom a normal family and become vice president of the United States.""Republican vice presidential candidate DanQuayle's official resume says he was the Indiana ConsumerProtection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit wascreated, state records show.The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effectJuly 1. Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator fromJuly until mid-September, when he became administrative assistantto then-Gov. Edgar D. Whitcomb.Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as hisofficial background, says he was chief investigator of the unit inthe Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971, saidRobert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney inIndianapolis.He was in fact the chief investigator. He helped get the unitset up. (But) it would not have been before 1971, Smith saidFriday in a telephone interview. We formally began operationsJuly 1.Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was inaccurateand said his staff had written the document.If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I didn't hold thatjob for two years, Quayle told reporters aboard his campaignplane.Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called therevelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland a cheapshot.Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by thestate Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from sixmonths of basic and advanced training for the Indiana NationalGuard.Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, was attendingIndiana University Law School at the time.M. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News,helped arrange his job interview with the state. Evans worked forEugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher of the News.At no point in any of this did Dan Quayle ask any favors oruse any influence, said Evans, now with the National JournalismCenter in Washington, D.C.He wouldn't have been hired as a chief investigator. He washired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch ofjobs on his merits. It's a nothing story, Evans said.Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently hadsurgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, TimothySendak.Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then anassistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to theestablishment of the Consumer Protection Division, all complaintsand inquiries were handled by me. The legal assistant assigned tome and utilized as my chief investigator was Dan Quayle. Herstatement was released by the Quayle campaign.The Consumer Protection Division was created by the statelegislature to resolve complaints over defective products, falseclaims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud.In 1980, Quayle referred to himself as a Vietnam-era veteranin campaign literature when he was running against three-termincumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race.Quayle, who enlisted in the Indiana National Guard, dropped thereference after objections by some Vietnam combat veterans.In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he was onactive duty for several periods during his tenure in the Guard.The statement referred to periods when Quayle was in basic trainingand 15 days of camp each summer.Dan Quayle is likely to be a man on theoutside in George Bush's White House following a vice presidentialcandidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, expertssay.Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevyof professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies,Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates orallies.Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas,Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditionalceremonial role  going to political gatherings and state funerals rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had,some scholars feel.Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about adecade or more. One thing that political scientists have beentalking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown. ...With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old days of politicsand funerals, said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of politicalscience at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies theAmerican presidency.Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during thecampaign. When asked, Bush employed the stock lines that Quaylewould make an outstanding vice president and had been temperedby steel as he weathered the early furor over his militaryservice, academic record and personal life.The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access tothe same papers, information and intelligence that is available tothe president. But he would go no further in describing whatassignments he would give Quayle.Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council,and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration'santi-drug efforts. I will be a very close adviser to thepresident, Quayle said.But that's not the way everyone sees it.Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaignswith substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers inimportant positions in the respective presidential campaigns,Barilleaux notes.Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to theBush campaign. He doesn't have his own big reputation on CapitolHill. ... Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House exceptGeorge Bush, Barilleaux says.They're going to give him a lot of window dressing, a spacecouncil, drug task force, but he's going to be a man on the outside... not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis, except on apro forma basis.But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bushcampaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role inthe administration than he had in the campaign.Vindication demands that. Both of them will want to prove howright the decision was, Mahe says.Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight,a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested andunqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Even somemembers of Quayle's own party were dismayed at Bush's choice.Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebratedgaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbledexplanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, I didn't live inthis century.Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, saysQuayle, while not the world's leading intellectual, is not acomplete dummy. He was simply thrust into a situation for which hewas unprepared, Ornstein says.I think he's immature. He's not stupid, Ornstein says.But Quayle comes to the White House with a very damagingstereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in thepolitical community and that's believed by a large segment of theelectorate, Ornstein says.That's going to give him a good deal to overcome. It's going togive him an enormous impetus to prove himself. That's going to bedifficult, given the office.Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution seeparallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon andSpiro Agnew. The choice of Nixon was viewed as a move by DwightEisenhower to appease the party's right wing, and Agnew was seen asa political nonentity.The natural response is to use him (Quayle) sparingly, as Nixondid with Agnew in 1968, Hess says. However, Quayle has fouryears to prove himself, and I think you're going to see stories intwo years about how much he's learned, how much he's actedresponsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988.Quayle admits the campaign was a learning process. After thecontroversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence from hisBush handlers, saying he would be his own man. He became moreaccessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedulehanded down from Washington and to deliver the party's scriptedmessage. Soon, he dropped off the front pages.And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at havinglittle control over his schedule and at ceasing to make nationalnews, he played the role of loyal No. 2 and even trumpeted his newanonymity.We have arrived as being a traditional vice presidentialnominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on thepages at all. That's what we're supposed to be, he told reporters.That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in aBush White House, Mahe feels, since Bush wants a private adviser,whose experience and opinion he respected ... (who) has never hadanother agenda.Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one manalone, Mahe says. You're never going to see Dan Quayle tellingtales out of school.","AP880819-0023,AP880818-0023,AP880817-0040,AP880818-0226,SJMN91-06140099,LA111289-0035,AP880826-0226,AP881114-0006","Indiana's Senator Quayle, Bush 1988 VP choice, attacked as novice","Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, George Bush's choice for vice-president in 1988, was criticized as a novice and his National Guard service and campaign gaffes attacked.

Baker III told a crowd of invitedguests and journalists on Berlin's Friedrich Street.And now, 29 years after it was built, we meet here today todismantle it and to bury the conflicts it created.Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and theforeign ministers from France, Britain and the two Germanys eachheralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change.Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status as anAllied-controlled city and the withdrawal of troops within sixmonths after the two German states unify, which could come inDecember.The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets anddistributed later to news media, apparently would also include theKremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper. TheUnited States, France and Great Britain have an estimated 12,000troops in West Berlin.Berlin has been split into Soviet, U.S., British and Francesectors and West Berlin remains technically separate from WestGermany.The German and Allied foreign ministers are meeting in EastBerlin to discuss the status of the city and a united Germany'srole in world affairs.All borders are to be opened between the Berlins and theGermanys by July 2, when the nations merge their economies.Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily,and U.S. officials decided to time the removal of CheckpointCharlie with the foreign ministers' meeting.A color guard of French, British and American soldiers strode tothe building and locked the doors leading to each Allied nation'scompartment in the checkpoint.The giant crane then lifted the box-like building high into theair. U.S. Army spokesman Sgt. Ed McCarthy said he believes it isdestined for a museum.Checkpoint Charlie stood just 20 yards from an East Germancheckpoint and was the only place between the Berlins that could becrossed on foot by non-Germans.The ceremony was closed to the public but not to the residentsof the buildings that line Friedrich Street, which had been dividedby the Berlin Wall since 1961.Illa Wobig leaned out her window and watched the ceremony unfoldjust 20 yards below the fourth-floor apartment where she has livedfor 24 years.I saw eight people shot to death on that street, she said.I saw an East German officer try to go under a guard rail. He wasshot in the neck.She said she also saw at least 20 successful escapes, by tunnel,car and on foot.I saw Kennedy, Reagan and Carter give speeches here, shesaid.

Checkpoint Charlie is a very important place to me.The Soviet Union said today that a unitedGermany can join NATO after a five-year transition period duringwhich all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. TheUnited States rejected the proposal, a U.S. official said.The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin on thestrategic future of a united Germany.The remarks, a copy of which were obtained by The AssociatedPress, indicates that a united Germany would be free to join theWestern NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period.But in exchange, Western and Soviet troops would pull out of thecountry and Germany's own military strength would be sharplyreduced, according to the proposal.Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S. Secretary ofState James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain,France and the two German states.I am underwhelmed, Baker said when asked about the Sovietproposal while posing for pictures with the other foreign ministers.A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S.officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany couldjoin NATO. The official said the other Western ministers expressedthe same reservations.The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has beenstaunchly opposed.West Germany now is a mainstay of NATO and East Germany is amember of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seeks to limit thestrength of the German armed forces and to revamp their structureto make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensiveoperations.It said those reductions could be undertaken over a three-yearperiod. Germany also would be prevented from producing or deployingchemmical or nuclear weapons.It also said that within six months of unification, all Westerntroops should leave West Berlin, which remains technically undermilitary occupation by the United States, France and Britian.The four nations would reduce their military forces in thecountry during a three-year period following unification first by50 percent, then bring them down to a level of token contingents,or completely withdraw them from Germany.There are about 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany, while aquarter-million U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany alongwith tens of thousands of British and French soldiers.Previously, the Soviets had said their troops would stay in whatis now East Germany for several years, but had left unclear theexact plans for pulling them out.Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal ofthe Western Allies' Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big FourPowers' troops out of greater Berlin within six months afterunification.The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets anddistributed to the news media, apparently would also include theKremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper.The United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated12,000 troops in West Berlin.

French Maj. Gen. Francois Lannbarked to a young American officer, who crisply led away the lastcontingent of military police.The public was not invited to the ceremony on Friedrich Street,the avenue blocked by Checkpoint Charlie and its once-feared EastGerman counterpart nearby.Illa Wobig raised six children in a fourth-floor apartment just20 yards from Checkpoint Charlie. They saw it from their window for24 years, and they saw it disappear Friday.I saw eight people shot to death on that street, said Mrs.Wobig, 55. I saw an East German officer try to go under a guardrail. He was shot in the neck.She said she saw at least 20 successful escapes.Some were in cars and some came through a tunnel across thestreet, she said. Some would walk very slowly, look around andjust run.She is not sure if one of the people she saw was Andreas Bratke,a 23-year-old East Berlin construction worker.Tunnels, balloons, customized vehicles and other elaboratemethods were used to flee past the Berlin Wall by desperate EastGermans.Bratke just ran.I ran as fast as I could, he said. I still cannot believeit.Bratke is now a West Berlin engineering student. He was takinghis certification examinations this week.Eight months after Bratke made his bold escape, Sgt. PatrickGainey was coming back from a party when he saw a huge commotionnear Checkpoint Charlie.This guy had driven a cement truck with his girlfriend andbaby through the checkpoint, said Gainey, a U.S. Armyphotographer. He drove a half-mile into the west side just tomake sure. When he stopped, he asked if he was in West Berlin.The escapee was Hans-Joachim Pofahl, who made the crossingthrough a hail of bullets.East Germany's border guards were as feared as members of thesecret police. According to guard Maik Polster, they were membersof the secret police.I was with the state security, said Polster, 23, as hegenially waved tourists through the East German checkpoint that isexpected to follow Checkpoint Charlie into oblivion.We had to maintain a certain level of appearance, he said.No smiling, no joking. We had to watch for everything.The stone-faced scrutiny of the East German border guards helpedgive Checkpoint Charlie its chilling cachet.The checkpoint went up with the Berlin Wall in 1961.With the wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of Germanunification, U.S. officials decided to remove Checkpoint Charliewith a grand flourish.Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze and their counterparts from France, Britain andthe two Germanys presided over the ceremony.While the Berlin Wall is coming down, temporary barricades wereput up to keep the public from the ceremony. Several hundred cranedtheir necks to watch from a half-block away.Eilli Wiechies, 60, watched the pageantry from his wheelchair onthe sidewalk in front of his apartment house, one of the fewregular people allowed on the grounds.Finally, Germans can cross, he said, bitter that the Alliedborder crossing was reserved only for non-Germans.A U.S. Army band played That is the Berlin Atmosphere, astirring old song about the old Berlin, as the white checkpointbuilding was lifted to within 30 feet of Mrs. Wobig's window.A sign saying What a pity, Checkpoint Charlie, hung from hersill.I saw Kennedy, Reagan and Carter give speeches here, shesaid.
