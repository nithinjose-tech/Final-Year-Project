0,d116i,"five astronaut board discoveri today for a second tri at send the hubbl space telescop into orbit to scan the outermost reach of the univers for clue to the begin of time. astronom are start to tingl again in anticip of what the hubbl will be abl to accomplish, said lennard fisk, head of nasa scienc activ. air forc forecast said there wa a 90 percent chanc the weather would be favor for launch the shuttl at the schedul time of 8:31 am. edt. more than a half million gallon of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pump into the space ship' fuel tank after midnight. the astronaut, wear bright orang flight suit, climb into the crew cabin just as dawn wa break over the kennedi space center. the $1.5 billion telescop, nasa' costliest cargo, will give astronom a new set of eye and ear that we don't have, said william lenoir, head of nasa' space flight program. it' go to chang our perspect altogeth. i can't say what we'r go to learn, but i'll be astound if we don't learn mani new thing. discoveri wa aim for an altitud of 380 mile, the highest a shuttl ha ever gone, so the telescop can be place in it proper orbit far abov earth' distort atmospher. it is the 35th shuttl mission. columbia, which journey into space next month with the astro observatori, sat on a launch pad 1.6 mile from discoveri, onli the second time both pad have been occupied; the first wa in 1986 just befor the challeng explos. hubbl ha been wait to take it place in space sinc 1983, delay by technic problem and the challeng accid. the latest postpon occur april 10, when discovery' launch wa scrub four minut befor liftoff becaus of a faulti power unit on the shuttl. the mood at the kennedi space center wa consider less festiv than dure the first launch attempt, when hundr of astronom gather with their famili. the day after launch, mission specialist steven a. hawley will use the shuttle' mechan arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescop into space. veteran spacewalk bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan will assist if a problem develop. discoveri will follow hubbl from 40 mile away for two day until after it len cap is open, expos the fine polish 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. hubbl is not expect to start provid scientif data by satellit for a month or more after liftoff. howev, nasa said it will releas it first imag an open star cluster in the constel carina a week after launch. in addit to the $1.5 billion cost of hubbl, $500 million ha been spent on spare part, astronaut train and comput softwar to oper the instrument. the european space agenc contribut $250 million for 15 percent of the view time. nasa estim it will cost $200 million a year to oper and maintain the telescop in space. dure it 15-year work lifetim, the telescop will provid astronom with 10 time better resolut and 25 time more sensit than ground-bas observatori. as a result, they will be abl to studi star and galaxi so distant their light ha been travel toward earth for 14 billion year. astronom hope to learn whether the univers wa creat 15 billion year ago as believ and uncov some of the mysteri surround galaxi, black hole and quasar. hubbl also is expect to shed light on how and when the univers might end. the telescop is name for the late astronom edwin p. hubbl, who discov dure the 1920 that the univers is expand. hi work gave rise to the big bang theori that the univers wa creat by a tremend explos. in addit to hubbl, discoveri carri a human skull fill with sensor to measur the space radiat that astronaut receiv. it is the skull' third trip into space. the shuttl is to end it five-day mission with a land at edward air forc base, calif. discovery' five astronaut return sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttl with nasa' most valuabl and celebr payload, the $1.5 billion hubbl space telescop. discoveri is schedul to lift off at 8:31 am. edt tuesday. we feel veri confid that thing are go to go well thi time, said discovery' command, air forc col. loren j. shriver. we'r go to come out ok on tuesday morn and, if not, we'll just keep tri until we do. that' kind of the name of the game here, shriver said. nasa test director mike leinbach said sunday that the countdown wa proceed smoothli and the shuttl appear to be in perfect condit. the countdown got under way saturday afternoon. a faulti power unit forc the first launch attempt to be scrub four minut befor liftoff april 10. the unit wa replac with a new one, which test show to be fine. hope, we'll get the shuttl off the pad thi time, leinbach said. a 70 percent chanc of favor weather wa expect at launch time, with low cloud be the main concern, said the air force' ed priselac, shuttl weather offic. a weak cold front from the north wa expect to pass through the area by monday night. the outlook is consider better for wednesday and thursday, priselac said. as discovery' astronaut arriv from johnson space center in houston earli sunday afternoon, the shuttl columbia wa be transport to a launch pad 1.6 mile from discoveri. it is onli the second time both shuttl launch pad at kennedi space center have been occupi simultan. the first time wa in januari 1986; 16 day after columbia lift off, challeng explod. columbia command vanc brand said he doe not believ the nation aeronaut and space administr is move too fast with hi shuttl. nasa expect to launch columbia with an astronom observatori call astro no earlier than may 16, one week later than plan becaus of discovery' two-week delay. in some case, it could be a problem have shuttl on both launch pad, brand said. in thi particular case, everything' fit togeth. nasa ha until saturday to get discoveri off the ground. after that, all launch attempt must be halt for eight day so hubble' batteri can be recharg. the six nickel-hydrogen batteri will power hubbl from the time it is disconnect from discovery' electr system until it two energy-collect solar panel take over in space. discovery' payload bay wa seal late saturday night, drastic reduc the risk of contamin to the telescope' fine polish 94.5-inch mirror. discoveri will aim for an altitud of 380 mile, the highest a shuttl ha ever gone, so the telescop can be place in it proper orbit far abov earth' distort atmospher. dure hubble' 15-year journey through space, astronom expect to look back to nearli the begin of time and solv some of the universe' most perplex mysteri. astro will measur ultraviolet radiat undetect by hubbl and thu provid addit target for the telescop. the $100 million observatori also will focu dure columbia' nine-day mission on comet austin, believ to be on it first trip through the solar system. both hubbl and astro were schedul for launch in 1986, but were delay by the challeng accid. the hubbl space telescop wa awaken from it self-induc sleep today but it wa still without the use of it high-spe antenna, and it scienc instrument were on hold, unabl to begin ani observ. we are out of the `safe-mode' right now, said steve terri, a supervisor of the engin control the telescop. he said the telescop wa run on a normal control-al mode, where it own comput and sensor guid where it is point. discovery' astronaut, meanwhil, pack their gear for a return to earth sunday, made some last-minut observ of earth and talk with ground-bas report about their flight. pilot charl bolden said he wa especi upbeat about the widespread public awar of the telescop, which is expect eventu to look back 14 billion light year nearli to the birth of the univers. it' hard to go somewher and find someon who ha never heard of the hubbl space telescop, said bolden. it make littl kids' eye light up. it make littl kid want to learn how to add and subtract and studi scienc. the telescope' big eye ha remain open, but hubbl had been in a safe mode with all motion stop becaus of earlier problem in link the high-spe dish antenna with a relay satellit. the antenna are the primari link for relay scientif data to the ground. terri said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape record in the telescop read telemetri signal from all it system and that these would be play to earth and analyz when the antenna are work properli. we expect to use that data to investig what happen, he said. engin are abl to send command to the telescop via it secondari antenna but the commun system is not use for scientif data, which must be transmit at a high rate of speed. we'r put the scientif instrument in a hold mode, in effect a standbi mode, he said. shortli after 6 am. edt, control at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt, md., complet a seri of command that took the telescop out of it safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour comput program to monitor hubble' health. it will take anoth day befor the $1.5 billion telescop is oper the way it wa suppos to at thi point in the startup process, said hubbl deputi project manag jean olivi. we'r back up to a veri deliber and slow and care approach to these problem, olivi said friday. thi is not the time to do anyth dumb. the telescop problem have put the flight center sever day behind, but the five astronaut who deploy it earlier thi week were stick to their schedul. land is schedul for 9:48 am. edt sunday at edward air forc base, calif., but flight control were keep a close watch on the weather. wind were predict to be about 20 mph with gust up to 29 mph. mission rule dictat that headwind cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown. the shuttl carri enough suppli to stay in orbit three day beyond sunday if necessari, nasa said. mission control awaken the crew member at about 1:30 am. edt today by play the song, cosmo. thank for the wake-up music, it' pretti appropri for today, said command loren shriver. the song wa select in honor of hubbl space telescop, which is now open for busi, said mission control comment jame hartsfield. the astronaut were to finish up their experi and photographi today and pack for the trip home. they also plan to hold a news confer from space with report at the johnson space center. shriver and pilot charl bolden were to run through a seri of test to make certain the shuttle' comput and control jet were readi for return to earth. the crew deploy hubbl on wednesday but they had stay close to the telescop in case there wa troubl open the apertur door. mission specialist bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were prepar to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 mile abov earth. but that prove unnecessari when the door wa open friday morn, expos the telescope' fine polish 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time. two of hubble' four position-stabil gyroscop stop work when the door open, but engin later got them back on line. the gyroscop were knock out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescop in the safe mode, said dave drachli, director of orbit verif at goddard. a colleagu, steve terri, said hubble' system were set at conserv limit for the first oper and that caus mani malfunct. there also were two commun outag total sever hour. hubbl is design with safe mode so it can be the master of it own destini in case contact with an orbit commun system is lost for extend period, terri said. nasa had plan to releas it first test imag from the telescop on tuesday, show an open star cluster in the constel carina. but terri said that would be delay becaus of the antenna problem. scientif data will follow in a month or two. the telescop, name for the late astronom edwin p. hubbl, will enabl astronom over it 15-year work lifetim to look back 14 billion year and possibl determin the age of the univers. the univers is believ to have been creat about 15 billion year ago in a cosmic explos. hubbl provid the basi for the big-bang theori of creation. he discov dure the 1920 that the univers is expand and that the farther the galaxi is from earth, the faster it is move away. after year of delay and a last-minut snag, the hubbl space telescop wa freed from the shuttl discoveri on wednesday and, glint in the sunlight, drift into orbit on it 15-year search for new world. mission specialist steven hawley releas hubbl from the end of the shuttle' 50-foot-long mechan arm after a delay in get one of the telescope' solar wing unfurl. the first of nasa' great observatori is now on station at 330 nautic mile abov the earth, mission control' jeffrey carr said. the telescop realli look great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it doe good work, discoveri command loren j. shriver said later. the $1.5 billion telescop wa releas at 3:38 pm. edt as the shuttl enter it 20th orbit of earth, nearli two hour and one orbit later than plan. the shuttl then back away. thank you veri much for the ride, said mike harrington, director of orbit verif at goddard space flight center in greenbelt, md. mission specialist bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had been in the shuttle' airlock, readi to walk inspac to free the solar panel. that prove to be unnecessari. close but no cigar, but better for the hubbl that it went the way it did, sullivan said. she and mccandless had train for nearli five year to make such a rescu mission. the first solar array unreel from it mast at midday wednesday as the shuttl pass 380 statut mile, or 330 nautic mile, abov south america' eastern coast. it start provid power to the telescope' batteri, which otherwis had onli eight hour of charg. deploy of the starboard panel, howev, wa more troublesom. it wouldn't budg when latch were first releas, then move about a fifth of it 39-foot length, and stop again. a third attempt roll the panel out all the way. houston, we see motion, command loren j. shriver report. hawley began the long process of releas hubbl shortli after 7 am. edt when he grasp it with discovery' 50-foot-long mechan arm and care hoist the 12{-ton telescop high abov the shuttl. hubbl wa taken off shuttl electr power just befor it wa lift out of the cargo bay and wa oper on it own nickel-hydrogen batteri. at one day, seven minut into the flight of discoveri, hubbl is now on it own intern power, carr said. the game ha begun. the race is on. the clock is tick. worri that the telescope' instrument would be starv for electr eas after the first solar panel wa stretch out. televis camera aboard discoveri show the first array as it wa pull from it reel slowli but steadili, the sun reflect off the gold-color panel and silveri telescop. discoveri wa 380 statut mile abov earth, 70 mile higher than ani shuttl ha ever flown. the orbit wa dictat by the need to put the telescop abov the earth' distort atmospher. discovery' five astronaut were awe by the view. i'd like to pass on the quot of the day from the on-board astronom someth to the effect that the big marbl sure look far away today, shriver said of hawley. astronom have wait seven year for hubbl to take it place in space. the telescop origin wa schedul for launch in 1983, but technic problem and the challeng explos push it back. the mission wa delay anoth two week when a faulti power unit on discoveri forc the nation aeronaut and space administr to halt the first launch attempt four minut befor april 10' schedul liftoff. on tuesday, discoveri final blast into space, transport hubbl out of thi world and in search of other. the telescope' 10-foot apertur door is to be open friday, expos the fine polish 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. discoveri wa follow hubbl in case the door doe not open properli. if a problem develop, mccandless and sullivan will be prepar onc again to walk in space. fred wojtalik, hubbl project manag, said the telescop would be test thursday for it abil to maneuev befor the apertur door is open. we want to be in full control so we don't ever endang the hubbl by put the apertur door close to the sunlight, he said. the telescop cannot focu into the sun becaus of the sensit of it five instrument. if all goe well, the crew will land sunday at edward air forc base, calif. nasa expect to releas it first imag from the telescop of an open star cluster in the constel carina on tuesday. data will follow in a month or two. astronom hope to look back to almost the begin of the time, studi star and galaxi so distant their light ha been travel to earth for 14 billion year. they expect to determin precis how and when the univers wa form, current estim at 15 billion year ago. the telescop is name for the late american astronom edwin p. hubbl, who discov dure the 1920 that the univers wa expand. he also wa respons for help to form the big bang theori of creation. ground control at the goddard space flight center final made contact today with the two main antenna on the $1.5 billion hubbl space telescop after tri for more than six hour to lock on. applaus erupt in the hubbl control center in greenbelt, md., as the glitch that mar hubble' first full day in space wa solv. we have confirm that we have achiev commun with the track and data relay satellit through the high-gain antenna system, said nasa' dave drachli. engin had said all along they believ the antenna were work all right and that the problem wa in incorrectli point either the satellit or the tdr, an orbit commun satellit that act as a switchboard. in the success attempt, they nearli doubl the width of the antennas' beam to take in more territori, from a sweep of 6.2 degre to 10.8 degre. the telescope' low-gain antenna, which receiv and transmit inform at a much slower rate and can be use in emerg, were work well. space shuttl discoveri wa 46 mile away, avail to remedi certain problem. the outag wa not a problem for which space walker would have been summon. the five astronaut were otherwis busi make pictur of storm over texa from their 380-mile-high perch, and do experi. steve terri, director of a team calibr variou aspect of the telescop, said the first outag wa caus by human error and wa not a seriou problem. it began between 1 and 1:30 am. edt and last 45 minut to an hour, he said. the second failur occur at 6:44 am. when control attempt to send a signal to the telescope' two high-gain antenna through the tdr. thi time it wa a point problem, said jim elliott, a goddard spokesman. it' a new spacecraft and we think inexperi deal with it wa the caus. the telescop, embark on a 15-year search for new world, wa releas from the shuttle' cargo bay wednesday after a last-minut snag that almost sent two astronaut on an emerg spacewalk. mission control awaken the crew earli today with a loud rendit of the song shout, a fratern hous favorit. good morn, discoveri. i guess you'r awak after that song, said kathi thornton, shuttl commun. there are a lot of happi peopl down here. we saw a great deploy yesterday and hubbl had a good night while you were asleep. we appreci the good word from everybodi, repli discoveri command loren shriver. after wednesday' deploy, shriver gentli back discoveri away from the telescop and put the shuttl through a seri of maneuv, the last one complet thi morn, to park discoveri in orbit 46 mile behind hubbl. the telescop realli look great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it doe good work, shriver said wednesday. well, it sure is now, loren, and thank for all the great work you'v done, repli mission control. galileo is real proud of you. scientist have hail the hubbl nasa' most expens unman spacecraft as the greatest advanc in astronomi sinc galileo rais a small telescop to hi eye nearli 400 year ago. discoveri and it five astronaut will follow the telescop while control at the goddard center make sure hubbl is oper properli, such as respond to direct command. the next mileston is friday, when the telescope' 10-foot apertur door is to be open, expos the fine polish 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. then on tuesday, nasa expect to releas the first imag from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constel carina. data will follow in a month or two. if the apertur door doesn't open properli, discoveri could return to the telescop so two astronaut could perform a spacewalk to fix it. hubbl project manag fred wojtalik said the telescop would be test today for it abil to maneuv befor the apertur door is open. we want to be in full control so we don't ever endang the hubbl by put the apertur door close to the sunlight, he said. too much light could damag the telescope' sensit instrument. on wednesday, mission specialist steve hawley use the shuttle' 50-foot robot arm to gentli grasp the 12{-ton telescop and hoist it from the cargo bay. one of the telescope' solar array unreel from it mast as expect and start provid power to the telescope' batteri, which otherwis had onli eight hour of charg. but there wa troubl with the second panel. it wouldn't budg when the latch were releas, and then move about a fifth of it 39-foot length and stop again. the panel roll all the way out on the third attempt. by the final attempt, astronaut bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were in their space suit in the airlock, 30 minut away from take tool in hand and go on an outer-spac mainten call. wojtalik said the caus of the problem is unknown. the 8{-hour procedur wa perform 380 mile abov earth, 70 mile higher than ani shuttl ha ever flown. the orbit wa dictat by the need to put hubbl abov the earth' distort atmospher. astronom hope to use the telescop to look back to almost the begin of the time, studi star and galaxi so distant their light ha taken 14 billion year to reach earth. they hope to determin how and when the univers wa form, current estim at 15 billion year ago. the telescop origin wa schedul for launch in 1983 but wa delay by technic problem and the challeng accid. discoveri, which blast into orbit tuesday, is schedul to land sunday at edward air forc base, calif. seven year late, the hubbl space telescop is where it belong, out of thi world and in search of other so distant that they may have been form at the begin of time. less than five hour after it rode into space aboard the shuttl discoveri on tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescop sent it first test radio signal. at the sign of life, applaus and cheer erupt in mission control in houston. as near as we can tell, everyth look perfect, said astronaut steve hawley from the shuttl. hawley' job on wednesday will be to drop the telescop overboard for a 15-year stay in space. discoveri, trail an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carri the silver-color telescop to an orbit 380 mile abov earth higher by 70 mile than ani previou shuttl. there the hubbl will stay to search for yet-unseen wonder of creation with instrument that can look 14 billion year backward in time. our window on the univers! nasa launch comment georg diller exult as the discoveri rose off it seasid launch pad. it' a beauti day to have hubbl space telescop in orbit instead of here on earth like it' been for so mani year, said nasa administr richard truli. hubble' in it element and i'm delight. the telescop wa suppos to be launch in 1983, but technic problem and the challeng accid delay it deploy. it suffer a further delay two week ago when the countdown wa stop at the four-minutes-to-go point becaus of a faulti hydraul unit on the shuttl. while it remain on earth, the telescop cost $7 million a month to exercis and keep in readi. in it first day in space, that checkout and test continu remot under control of the goddard space flight center in maryland. on hand to watch the discoveri launch wa a conting of scientist who have hail the hubbl as the greatest advanc in astronomi sinc galileo rais a small telescop to hi eye nearli 400 year ago. truli refer to the early-day astronom when he wa ask about the long delay in get the telescop to it work station. somebodi the other day said, `who rememb the day that galileo pick up hi telescop to look at the stars?' said truli, a former shuttl astronaut. it doesn't matter what day we launch hubbl, it matter that we do it right. the telescop is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diamet, about the size of a railroad tank car. when it fli free, it will receiv electr power for it six scientif instrument from two wing-lik solar array that extend outward on each side. it is name after the late astronom edwin p. hubbl, who theoriz that the univers wa expand and that the farther away a galaxi is, the faster it is travel. that gave support to the theori that a massiv explos the big bang creat the univers 10 to 20 billion year ago. the hubbl is expect to help provid the answer to two major questions: how old is the univers? how big is it? the telescop ha two mirror, one 94.5 inch in diamet, the other 12 inch. two of the instrument are camera, two are spectromet and one is a photomet. in addit, the fine point system act as a sixth instrument by provid precis measur of distanc. on wednesday, hawley is to grappl the 12{-ton telescop with the shuttle' mechan arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and after a long checkout drop it overboard to orbit on it own. in the cargo bay, the telescop receiv electr power from the shuttl. but the juic is cut when the instrument is lift out and it will depend on intern batteri until the solar panel are extend to receiv light from the sun. should the solar panel not deploy, mission specialist bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan will be stand by, partial dress in space suit, readi to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the array manual. discovery' launch wa not without it problem. with 31 second left in the countdown, the comput that run the final moment befor liftoff refus to close a fuel valv and stop the launch process. the problem wa overcom and the shuttl lift off at 8:34 am. edt, about three minut late. the shuttl is schedul to land sunday at 9:49 am. edt at edward air forc base in california. on the way uphil, as command loren j. shriver put it, the shuttle' windshield wa splatter with sever fleck of thing. he said the windshield wa streak by the debri and that it also wa smear when the spent booster rocket fell off dure the climb to orbit. the astronaut also had problem with their uhf radio circuit, and one of the ship' small rear thruster wa inop. neither problem wa consid seriou. the shuttl that put the hubbl space telescop into orbit also carri an instrument use in the 1920 by astronom edwin hubble: the eyepiec from what onc wa the world' most power telescop. it' a great pleasur to have someth of such histor signific and someth that so directli symbol edwin hubble' fundament contribut to astronomi, astronaut kathi sullivan said friday as she circl the earth in space shuttl discoveri. the eyepiec from the mount wilson observatory' 100-inch hooker telescop wa carri into orbit by sullivan. after she bring the eyepiec back to earth, it will be place on display at the observatori. it' basic a symbol gestur from the past of astronomi to the futur of astronomi, said lyn mcafe, spokeswoman for the mount wilson institut. the pasadena-bas group run the observatori, locat in the san gabriel mountain outsid lo angel. the discoveri made by hubbl on the 100-inch telescop at mount wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understand of the univers, mcafe said. we believ the hubbl space telescop will do the same thing. the hooker telescop wa the world' most power telescop from it construct in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch hale telescop wa place in oper at mount palomar observatori northeast of san diego. use the hooker telescop, hubbl wa the first to determin the distanc to a galaxi outsid the milki way, the institut said in a statement. thi crucial discoveri provid the first definit proof that other galaxi exist far beyond the confin of our own local galaxi, the institut said. dure the 1920 and 1930, hubbl and an assist use the hooker telescop to take thousand of photograph of faint galaxi, show that most of them were move away from each other veri quickli. thi provid observ evid for the concept, suggest by einstein' theori of rel, that the univers is expand, the institut said. hubble' work help convinc scientist the univers wa creat in a giant explos, call the big bang, an estim 15 billion year ago. the hooker telescop wa mothbal in 1985 by the carnegi institut, former oper of the observatori, in a money-sav move. the institut hope to obtain fund to reopen it.

There it successfully released the $1.5 billion dollar Hubble Space Telescope from its cargo bay.  Now in the process of overcoming some start-up problems, the telescope should soon be operational.","The shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth, it will provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled.  Once released, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  However, scientists, optimistic that the Hubble will soon be operational, authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return home.","Following an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  Named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who did pioneering work leading to the ""Big Bang"" concept of the universe, it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime, it will provide astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.  The telescope was placed on special flight modes until these start-up problems are resolved.  Confident that the Hubble will soon be operational, the shuttle Discovery is preparing to return home.","Discovery carries $1.5 billion Hubble Telescope to space April 24, 1990","On April 24, 1990, shuttle Discovery carried the Hubble Space Telescope 380 miles into space, then followed briefly to assist if necessary.

Once in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere, Hubble would be able to see 10 times better than the largest Earth telescopes. Wednesday it was lifted into space by Discovery's mechanical arm and released into orbit. Friday the 94.5-inch mirror was exposed to starlight. Saturday controllers took Hubble out of safe mode. Problems with a solar power array, communications antennas, and two position-stabilizing gyroscopes -- exacerbated by conservative limits set on systems -- put Hubble several days behind schedule and delayed transmittal of the first photograph. Discovery's astronauts -- Shriver, Bolden, Hawley, McCandless, and Sullivan - - were all veterans of previous flights. The shuttle followed Hubble for two days to assist if necessary. A seven-month checkout period would follow. Spacelab Astro was to be put up two weeks later to give Hubble additional target information. Hubble, delayed since 1983, cost $1.5 billion. Spare parts, training, and software cost $500 million more. Maintenance cost $7 million a month on Earth and will cost $200 million yearly in orbit, for Hubble's 15-year lifetime.

'who did thi? who can stop thi happen again?' across bombay peopl were ask themselv the same question thi weekend. they sens there wa an enorm differ from the riot which scar the citi in decemb and again in januari. those were caus by a tradit mix of crime, polit agit and ancient hindu-moslem hatr stir by the destruct of the mosqu in ayodhya. the weapon use were mostli primit - knive, club and petrol bottl. friday' outrag, by contrast, bear the deadli stamp of high-technolog terror, complet with semtex plastic explos, high-grad timer, effici organis and money. the onli compar previou incid wa the assassin in 1991 of mr rajiv gandhi, the former prime minist, by sri lanka' tamil tiger terrorist. but that wa a singl bomb aim at one man - the explos in bombay were design to terroris the nation' commerci capit. bombay account for 35 per cent of india' export. mr p v narasimha rao, the prime minist, describ the blast as an attack on india' economi. the immedi assumpt both at the highest level and in the street of bombay wa that those respons must have been foreign or had foreign help. but these suggest were seen in bombay as a deliber attempt to deflect attent from the peopl who in the popular mind are the real suspect - moslem extremist who might have taken reveng for the riot which hit india after the ayodhya mosque' destruct and which left 2,000 dead, includ 700 in bombay. if moslem are found to have stage the attack, the indian author will certainli suspect that the oper wa support from a moslem countri, notabl pakistan. the implic would be vast. break diplomat relat would be the minimum step delhi could take on a danger road. mr rao chose hi word care dure hi visit to bombay: 'there is a definit possibl that our search may not stop within the countri. i do not want to name anybodi becaus it will have ramif within and outsid the country.' there is no evid link the attack to moslem extremist, let alon to pakistan. even if moslem group are found to be respons for the bomb, they could have been suppli from other moslem countri. india would still face a diplomat crisi but hardli on the same scale. for the moment, such concern seem remot from the street on bombay, where the atmospher yesterday wa calm. workmen were clear away rubbl at the blast site, includ the blacken stock exchang build. bombayit seem determin to put the outrag behind them. at the gymkhana club and dozen of other sport ground, hundr of men and boy were play cricket as they do everi sunday. other were walk along the seafront by the arch of the gateway of india. the stock exchang author plan to re-start trade as soon as they can -probabl today - use an old trade floor the exchang vacat onli last year. businessmen estim the main loss to the citi would be the loss of life and injuri and the damag caus to blast build. they did not expect the same widespread disrupt to product as occur dure the riot. some of the credit for the limit disrupt should go the govern and the polic for promptli call paramilitari and regular troop to help patrol sensit district. but much more should go to the peopl of bombay, who, so far at least, have refus to be goad into violent protest by the bomber.

someth which he resist and over which, in the end, he had no control. most industrialist, howev, find it hard to criticis mr major as an individu, with mani draw a flatter parallel between hi person qualiti and those of hi predecessor. he still attract gratitud for the elect victori, which wa seen -

Though he won the 1992 general election, the high-school dropout is now accused of being a weak leader, incompetent on both domestic and international issues.","On Easter Sunday, three Cabinet ministers issued statements on behalf of  Prime Minister John Major amidst speculation that he could be forced out this autumn. In May local elections across Britain, however, the Conservatives loss 444 seats, and word circulated that Major was not up to the job.Major became leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister after his mentor, Margaret Thatcher resigned under pressure in 1990. Though he won the 1992 general election, the lingering recession and controversies involving European community issues splintered the Tories. He came to be viewed as a weak, vacillating leader, lacking political conviction.","In early May elections across Britain, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing 444 seats. One editorial claims some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major, and there is speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher when she resigned under pressure in November 1990. After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift. Major's comment while visiting America a month later that Iraqi troops might have to be ""forcibly removed"" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard-line on the Persian Gulf.Within a year of winning the general election, his popularity had plunged. In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015 the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Though Major's personal style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak leader, lacking vision and political conviction. Not even recent revelations that Major uses salty language can alter his wimp image.","John Major elected leader of Conservative Party, becomes next Prime Minister.","John Major emerged victorious in an election for leadership of the Conservative Party and became, at 47, Britain's youngest prime minister. His popularity began to decline very soon after his election and he is viewed and weak and indecisive. Having reneged on campaign promises, he is blamed for the recession which plagues Britain.","At 47, John Major became Britain's youngest prime minister. His accession to power followed the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following a challenge by former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine to her leadership. Major fell two votes shy of a victory in an election with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Heseltine but both opponents quickly conceded to Major. Since his election, Major has been seen as weak and indecisive. He is an unpopular leader whose cabinet has been rocked by scandal and who reneged on campaign promises. Adding to his unpopularity is the recession which continues plague Britain.","John Major was 47 when he was elected to lead the Conservative Party. Assuming the position of prime Minister from Margaret, Mr. Major became the youngest prime minister since the 19th century. Mr. Major was confirmed as leader of the Conservative Party when his two opponents, former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, conceded defeat in an election which saw Major two votes shy of a majority. Major, whose father was a trapeze artist in the circus, overcame many obstacles in his rise to the top. He was a high school drop out and for a time was a welfare recipient. Mr. Major had little time to enjoy his victory as public opinion of him soon soured. While seen as gentler than his abrasive predecessor, he is viewed as timid and indecisive. Almost from the first he has been beset by scandal in his cabinet and a number of controversies ranging from internal party differences over Europe to the debacle surrounding Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System to a deep and continuing recession. Major came out in strong support of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, calling on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait.",,,,

social, cultur and psycholog reason play a part. social, the 1890 read public wa a vastli more homogen group than today: a small number of middl class author wrote for a middl class audienc at a time when to be liter wa to belong to an elit. the idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction wa irrelev. cultur, these writer and reader were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel wa their polit and intellectu forum. today we no longer share the victorian confid in the novel as a key genr of our age. modern and the overturn of the tradit form by joyc and woolf weaken 20th-centuri belief in the novel and encourag the diverg between highbrow and lowbrow. the domin of film and televis ha made novel a more margin form and perhap they no longer attract the most creativ talent. georg du maurier origin offer the outlin of trilbi to henri jame, who he thought would write a better novel. today du maurier would have sold it to hollywood or the bbc. the fantasi element of fiction, in which we identifi with charact as if we know them, wa answer in the 19th centuri by the novel; in the 20th centuri we have tv soap. just as the tabloid newspap featur charact from eastend, so when dickens' the old curios shop wa run as a serial there wa widespread press specul on whether littl nell would die, and reader wrote in beg for her to be save. sentiment, access, topic - what characteris today' soap were clear featur of the novel in 1894. both in the year of jubile and esther water, for exampl, centr on the burn 1890 debat about marriag, femin and the 'new woman', yet both are also tearjerk which everyon enjoy. the 1894 book are compel becaus they prefigur our own time and yet are set back from them. trilbi is a tale of hypnot and the unconsci a decad away from freud; the ebb tide pave the way for conrad' heart of dark and the first question of coloni oppress. it is unlik that the 1994 booker choic will speak as eloqu of new trend today. wherea the 1894 titl had contemporari set, mani of the 1994 book are histor (such as paradis) or are driven by nostalgia (such as besid the ocean of time). which book will win on octob 15? stevenson will get the sympathi vote becaus he die in 1894 in samoa, the set of the ebb tide. jungl book will get the retrospect vote, becaus it is the best-known today and ha fashion mythic overton in the lost paradis of mowgli' jungle; it posit on the list may also rescu it from schmaltzi disney associ and confirm it as a seriou novel about a young man' self-discoveri. my vote goe to trilbi. soft-focu, ideolog shaki - in it anti-semit portrait of svengali - and sometim sloppi, it is a stori of demon possess and haunt the imagin like a fairi tale long after better-written work have fade from memori. like rebecca, the popular novel by du maurier' granddaught, it is a natur equival of what the current booker prize seek to create: a combin of the classic and the bestsel. the shortlist of six for the pound 20,000 booker prize for fiction, announc yesterday, immedi prompt the question 'who?' from mani in the publish industri. accord to one insid, some on the list 'are b-team writer at best'. the six includ alan hollinghurst' the fold star (publish by chatto and windus), a melancholi studi of homosexu obsess which wa tip as a like candid from the initi 'long list' of 15, the reef (granta) by young sri lankan writer romesh gunesekera and how late it wa, how late (secker and warburg) by gritti glasgow realist jame kelman, which wa almost univers well-review. as for the other three - knowledg of angel (green bay) a philosoph fabl by children' author jill paton walsh, paradis (hamish hamilton) by zanzibar-born writer abdulrazak gurnah and besid the ocean of time (john murray) by 72-year-old orcadian poet georg mackay brown - 'frankli, they don't make the grade'. the shortlist for the booker, the uk' most hype literari prize and one of the most lucr, is all the more surpris in a bumper year for new fiction fulfil the criteria - english languag and non-american - for consider for the award. margaret atwood' the robber bride seem an astonish omiss, as do new novel by peter ackroyd, peter carey, candia mcwilliam, william trevor and jim crace. but if the shortlist of the final six candid for the prize may be disappoint, the tradit controversi surround the award is as rife as ever. one unsurpris omiss from the final select wa when the world wa steadi, a first novel by clair messud, which wa on the 'long list' befor it wa point out that the author wa the wife of jame wood, chief literari review of the guardian newspap and a booker judg. professor john bayley, chairman of the booker panel and husband of former booker prize winner dame iri murdoch, express surpris at mr wood' failur to reveal hi relationship with ms messud. but it is the final list, rather than the controversi, that discredit the award accord to some critic.

that must be explor. nicolaid said he hope it would be possibl to tap american and turkish expertis to excav the wreck as an intern project. american expert from the institut of nautic archaeolog at

aegean and rare carri out excav. ferri are among the safest vessel afloat. but, as the tragic sink of the estonia with the loss of more than 800 live demonstr, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high. as ferri increas in size, so the number on board at risk from mechan failur or a crew error go up. the move to roll-on roll-off ferri with vehicl deck which run the entir length of the vessel ha increas the risk that, onc the sea penetr the hold through the bow door or a gash in the ship' side, it can lead to the vessel capsiz. the unit nation intern maritim organis (imo) and it member, the ship-own nation, have devot much thought over the past two decad to ship safeti. but the sink of the estonia should lead to a new review of ferri safeti. particularli worri are the eyewit report which suggest that water penetr the bow door in a manner reminisc of the sink of the herald of free enterpris in 1987. unlik the herald, the estonia appear to have had it door close, but ro-ro are undoubtedli veri vulner to water penetr. ani review of ferri safeti should focu on three main issu. first the subject of ferri design should be reconsid. addit stabil could be provid by the addit of sponson, stabilis bulg which project from the ship' side just abov the water line. greater resist to an influx of water could be obtain by instal moveabl barrier or bulkhead to break up the larg car deck. these propos were look at by the british govern in the wake of the sink of the herald of free enterpris. it calcul that it would cost between pound 70m and pound 85m to improv standard on the 57 vessel in the uk ferri fleet, with a further pound 22m in extra annual run cost. higher cost would inevit lead to higher fare - unwelcom to ferri oper when, on the short cross-channel rout, they face competit from the channel tunnel. but the difficulti of push through fare rise would be noth like as damag to the ferri compani as anoth disast. second, the imo and nation govern must look close at how to improv enforc of exist regul. the imo ha been tri to move enforc up it agenda, but it depend on the good will and profession of govern and shipown. third, the imo should be given support by nation govern in it campaign, launch yesterday, to improv crew train. much of the regul in recent year ha concentr on improv the ship and it equip. abov all, if new regul doe turn out to be necessari, it must be introduc speedili. as thing stand, it can take year befor chang are ratifi by enough govern to give them forc. the european union, which sweden and finland are get readi to join, could take a lead in speed up the process. ship safeti is not, of cours, just an issu for the ferri sector. five (small) ferri were lost last year, accord to lloyd' regist. but thi figur pale into insignific compar with the 96 gener cargo ship and 12 tanker which also went down. when a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goe down in a distant ocean, veri littl attent is paid. if the loss of a rel modern passeng vessel in european water can make ship safeti a higher prioriti for govern and the public, thi will be some small compens for the loss of life from the estonia. two sailor were miss

7,d118i,"john g. tower ha fallen, but the sky ha not. for all the forecast of dire result if the senat block tower' path to the pentagon, busi is proceed as usual. presid bush said the case wa close and accept democrat assur of futur cooper. that doesn't undo the resent among some of tower' more ardent republican alli in the senat and in some corner of the white hous. bush lieuten claim they had heard what sound like assur of support from a dozen senat democrat. they end up with onli three democrat in the close-to-party-lin vote against tower. nevertheless, a week after the former texa senat

to activ resist put up to perestroika by corrupt group. perestroika, or restructur, is gorbachev' program for widespread econom and social chang. state-run media also indic friday that a crackdown had begun on peopl in armenia who continu to agit for annex of a mostli armenian enclav in the neighbor republ of azerbaijan. the six-month conflict between the two republ over control of the

nagorno-karabakh' statu but call for measur to develop the region' economi and cultur. the conflict over nagorno-karabakh is one of the most rancor domest disput face by gorbachev sinc he becam communist parti chief in march 1985. he indic friday he want to defus tension between ethnic group, but also to punish those who transform the tension into a polit crisi. gorbachev spoke befor a plenari meet of the central committe, the party' policy-mak bodi. a summari of hi remark wa distribut by the offici tass news agenc. gorbachev outlin the reason for a current aggrav of tension between ethnic group in some region of the soviet union, tass said. among the caus, gorbachev list a lack of concern for mani year for the specif requir of peopl and ethnic group, inadequ control by the mass over the activ of execut personnel, and activ resist put up to perestroika by corrupt group. tass said that after gorbachev note that nationalist passion benefit all anti-perestroika forc, he suggest increas account in soviet law for kindl ethnic strife. tass did not give detail of gorbachev' suggest. at the juli 18 presidium meet, the soviet leader accus corrupt conserv who oppos hi reform of hide behind the nagorno-karabakh annex drive. gorbachev said the ground for tougher legisl come directli from articl 36 of the 1977 soviet constitut, which say the law can punish ani advocaci of racial or nation exclus, hostil or contempt. tass said gorbachev made other propos on how to resolv ethnic tension, includ an increas in power for each of the country' 15 republ, a law on equal use of the more than 100 languag spoken in the soviet union and some econom autonomi for the country' republ and region. in particular, the baltic republ of lithuania, latvia and estonia, forcibl incorpor into the soviet union in 1940, have demand more say in their own econom and govern affair. the labor newspap trud said 44 peopl in yerevan, armenia' capit, will face crimin charg follow an incid in

their licens revok and 310 were fine. in it juli 18th decis, the presidium also order local law enforc agenc to ensur order wa restor in the caucasu mountain region. tass report friday that the situat wa stabil in armenia, but said that at the urg of instig, some strike and protest were continu. the intern commun is start to look beyond the conflict in the former yugoslavia, and is becom increasingli awar of the true magnitud and serious of ethnic and polit conflict in the former soviet union. the problem is inde a press one. the disput in the transcaucasu, central asia, and elsewher in the former soviet union are caus great suffer for those involv. they are a sourc of legitim concern to the russian, who are worri by clash close to their border. they are concern too about the safeti of ethnic russian live in those countri where there are conflict, and about the econom and social consequ of refuge flee to russia (whose potenti number is estim at more than 2m). they believ that the problem in some of the former soviet republ are either ignor or misunderstood. the russian fear that if they do noth, the conflict will worsen and probabl spread. they argu that they have a legitim concern in tri to resolv conflict that threaten their secur. they ask whi, when the intern commun is engag in peacemak and peacekeep in mani of the world' troubl spot, similar effort should not be undertaken in the hot spot near them. equal, these disput are of legitim concern to britain, it western partner and the whole intern commun, both for humanitarian reason and becaus such flashpoint risk provok region instabl. if uncontrol, they pose a varieti of threat to european secur, includ increas traffic in drug and arm as well as intern terror. crise in russia' newli independ neighbour may also complic russia' relat with the west: unless they are care handl, they risk prejud the emerg relationship between us. the west is sometim suspici of moscow' attitud. there are no differ about the need to resolv these conflicts: but there are differ over how to go about it. the british govern will not underwrit russian involv unless it is sure that peacekeep troop will not turn into occupi forc. nor are countri that secur their independ when the soviet union wa dissolv keen that the west should conced to moscow the same role it play in the soviet empir. they fear that thi would compromis their sovereignti. when they are will for russian troop to play a peacekeep role, they want there to be some form of intern monitor. thi ha meant that, even though the west lack the resourc to engag directli in those troubl spot, it ha been wari of appear to endors russian involv instead, in case it had imperi tendenc. if we are to fashion a joint approach by russia and it western partner to the problem of peacekeep in the former soviet union, we must address all these concern. clearli russia ha an import role to play in thi area. if the russian want intern recognit and more activ support from the intern commun, the west in turn need guarante that russia will not regard recognit of it involv as give it cart blanch in the former soviet union. peace-keep in the former soviet union, as inde peacekeep elsewher, must compli with intern recognis principl. it need to be look at on a case by case basi. respect for the sovereignti of the newli independ countri must remain paramount. we agre that the principl underli russian, ci or intern peacekeep oper would need to include: strict respect for the sovereignti of the countri involved; an invit from the govern concern and the consent of the parti to the conflict; commit to a parallel polit peac process; a clear mandat set out the role of the peacekeep forc (which should whenev possibl be multin in character); and an exit strategi for the peacekeep forc deploy. these principl should help stimul a dialogu and polit settlement between the parti to the conflict, focu attent and, where possibl, resourc on the settlement of conflict in the former soviet union. all thi will help enhanc russian peacekeep practic. although the confer for secur and co-oper in europ and the un lack the resourc to put larg number of peacekeep on the ground themselv, they may be abl to suggest measur to enhanc transpar and to monitor the peac process. extend co-oper within the north atlant co-oper council, and also co-oper between russia and nato, might help improv train for russian peacekeep. thi is an area we shall need to explor further. we also need to put much more emphasi on prevent diplomaci. one of the way in which we can help prevent conflict is to strengthen the democrat institut in the newli independ countri of the former soviet union. the csce and other intern institut can play an import role here, draw the newli independ countri into a more activ dialogu on way of promot democrat valu and principl. we discuss way of strengthen the csce' role, includ the role of the high commission for nation minor, at the recent rome ministeri meet. we must tri to find way of manag and resolv tension befor they erupt into conflict. it will not be easi, but we must tri. potenti explos cocktail of ethnic and polit animos could spread the fire of intoler all too easili to other countri and region. we need to deal with it togeth in the spirit of partnership. and we need to deal with it urgent. our secur is indivis and we must ensur it by vigor and imagin effort aim at promot peac for all as well as right for all. the author are uk foreign secretari and russian foreign minist russia flew 3,000 special

The 1990 Super Bowl was the lowest rated in 21 years, although the most watched TV event of the week.Super Bowl XXV, to be held in Tampa in 1991, will feature local events planned by a committee headed by two black men in order to resolve an area racial dispute. Only 80% of the face value of Super Bowl tickets can be deducted now. The Rose Bowl is being offered rent free to the NFL for Super Bowl XXVII.","The San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl in 1989 and 1990 marking the fourth win in four tries. Super Bowl records were set by the 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and wide receiver Jerry Rice. President Bush congratulated the 1989 victors at an East Room reception.Super Bowl XXIV (1990) was the most watched TV event of the week although it was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 21 years.

Tighter tax laws haven't diminished corporate attendance. In Tampa 1991, the black community shared in the profits.San Francisco has four Vince Lombardi Trophies.","Super Bowl XXIV gave the 49ers their fourth Vince Lombardi Trophy. Sixty-three percent of TV viewers watched the lopsided game which also featured the conclusion of the ""Bud Bowl II,"" a $7 million Anheuser Bush ad campaign. Though the game can spotlight a community's problems, it also has tremendous economic impact. Communities such as Los Angeles--Orange County, therefore, offer incentives, such as rent-free stadium use, to lure the game to their city. Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

topic in the thousand of interview he gave wa hi own squalid history: hi voraci drug use, hi perfidi to employe, hi unquench sexual promiscu and so on. by hi own account, then, mr. lennon wa not about to dethron ward cleaver as the all-american dad. hi public love him in spite of it all -- or perhap becaus of it all. mr. lennon grew to celebr dure a time when such transgress as intemper and

do not obscur the countless other reason to hate mr. goldman' book. there is, for starter, the sloppi, pompou prose, so suggest of the grad-school smoke loung -- mr. goldman is the sort of writer who refer to pop song as ""pieces,"" as though they were concerti. there is hi know, hipper-than-th approach -- toward drug, sex, music -- that give him licens to second-guess mr. lennon' everi move. and

1990 and four days later was orbiting on its own 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere. The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,

-- sure an olymp record in itself. but when the 1988 summer game end sunday night, so, too, did the chanc for american athlet to follow in her footstep. ad agenc execut, who spend everi fourth year glu to their tv set, hope to pick out the next star to hawk their clients' product, say that thi olympiad wa a dud. ""i suspect thi will go down as the dullest in the histori of the olympics,"" say jerri della femina, chairman of ad agenc della femina mcname wcr. ""thi is the first olymp without passion, and without passion you don't have testimoni. without hero, you don't have anyon that anyon want to emulate."" on the surfac, the game seem to offer all the drama that usual make for lucr endors contract. who could forget diver greg lougani smack hi head on the springboard, then come back to win two gold medal? or flamboy florenc griffith joyner, her two-inch fingernail rake the air as she won the 100-meter sprint? but even these two, along with jacki joyner-kerse, who won the women' heptathalon and the long jump, may find it more difficult than in previou year to turn gold medal into gold in the bank. the fact is, say mani market, olymp gold ha lost much of it commerci luster. ""i don't think it' big money like it use to be,"" say michael goldberg of nation media group inc., the new york sports-market firm that repres ms. retton. ""it use to be kind of a knee-jerk reaction to do an ad campaign around an olymp athlet. it just doesn't happen anymore."" certainli, thi year' win olympian will have no troubl secur contract from special sports-equip outfitt and speak invit from obscur trade group. but the major, high-pay endors -- such as those with soft-drink compani and fast-food outlet -- just don't seem to be surfac, at least not yet. earlier thi year, sport market estim that a gold medal won dure the summer game could earn a person athlet more than $1 million in endors. now, market say, these medalist will be lucki to pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year. advertis can reel off a litani of reason whi these olymp aren't ignit much spark. for one thing, they suffer by comparison with the 1984 summer game, so excit becaus they were held in lo angel and becaus, in the absenc of boycot soviet-bloc countri, the american won 83 gold medal. the 1988 game, by contrast, were broadcast from halfway around the world, and the soviet trounc the american, 55 gold medal to 36. what' more, market say, thi year' drug scandal cast a pall over the game, especi the incid involv canadian sprinter ben johnson, who lost hi gold medal after test posit for steroid. nbc' tv coverag also get it share of the blame. market say it wa so bland and skip so frequent from one event to anoth that there wa littl chanc for excit to build. the constant commerci interrupt, which led to rate that were much lower than expect, didn't help, either. dure most of the past game, ""there wa enough continu tv coverag so that, much like a soap opera, it wa possibl to get involv in the live and in the competition,"" say leigh steinberg, attorney for ice-skat brian boitano, a gold medalist at the 1988 winter game. but not thi summer, he say. recent chang in olymp rule, meanwhil, have led to a glut of olympian in search of endors deal. befor the 1984 game, most olymp athlet weren't allow to make commerci unless they gave up their amateur statu. now, they can appear in as mani ad as they want, but the incom must go into a trust fund for train expens. ""everi year, more and more olymp peopl are out there want to do commerci -- basic, everybodi is available,"" say daisi sinclair, a vice presid with ad agenc ogilvi group inc. as a result, while onc an ""aura"" surround an olympian, now ""the bloom is off."" compani also are becom more sophist in their approach to celebr endors. increasingli cost consciou, they will no longer hook up with an olympian just becaus the compani presid like the athlete' sport. and after year of pay big buck to olymp star onli to see them fade into obscur, compani have final gotten the hint that olympian fame is of the most fleet varieti. ""if you think your phone will ring off the hook if (you win) a gold medal, it isn't go to happen anymore,"" say stephen disson, senior vice presid of market for proserv inc., a washington sports-market firm. compani now know that ""six month from now there will be other hero from other sport events"" for them to consid. ad agenc bbdo worldwide' attitud toward the olymp is becom typic. it use sport star in it commerci for pepsi light and oppenheim mutual fund but ha no plan to call on ani of 1988' olympian. ""i prefer to use athlet who are in the public eye on a regular basi, like footbal and basketbal players,"" say charl miesmer, the agency' execut creativ director. ""peopl like michael jordan have 10-plu year in their sport career, all in a row, so i don't have to worri about the public say, 'carl who?'"" and don't look for ani of 1988' winner to start show up on wheati box, either. gener mill inc., which ha featur ms. retton and decathalon gold-medalist bruce jenner on it wheati box in the past, say it look for three qualiti in an endorser: career achiev, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplish. a spokeswoman say that none of thi year' crop meet all three criteria. so far, ms. joyner-kerse ha had the most visibl endors. even befor the olymp began, she had made commerci for primaten mist and 7-up. and, accord to her agent, pearl hodg of world class manag, she is now ""in the process"" of sign with mcdonald' corp., to work on behalf of it effort to aid underprivileg children. ms. joyner-kersee' sister-in-law, ms. griffith joyner, may soon take the endors lead. advertis say with her good look and fashion flare, she is attract more interest than ani of the other medal winner. (the sprinter' manag couldn't be reach for comment.) anoth olympian with endors potenti is swimmer matt biondi, who won five gold medal. mr. biondi ha alreadi sign a swim-wear contract with arena usa inc., and park brittain, hi agent at advantag intern inc., say hi client ""will definit be in a high-incom ring, the highest you can name."" then there is mr. lougani. sinc win two gold medal dure the 1984 summer olymp, the diver ha had littl luck with major endors. and a few market execut say that even hi second sweep of the dive event may not up hi potenti.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.

Satellites, computers, and reconnaissance planes helped forecasters monitor Hugo's progress. Insurance claims broke records.

It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo. Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.",Hurricane Hugo Could Have Been Deadlier. Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.",,,,

The jury acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 counts and deadlocked on 13.  The case began in 1983 and became a frenetic witch-hunt led by the California media.  At one time, seven defendants, 135 charges, and over 400 children were involved.  Following the verdict, defendants wept, while parents decried the system for failing their children.  The judge was not surprised.  Jurors faulted the children's videotaped interviews, saying the interviewer asked leading questions.  Jurors believed some may have been molested, but the prosecution failed to prove the defendants responsible.  The therapist conducting the interviews defended her technique.

The pre-school's neighbors were disappointed and concerned about the building.Reverberations will continue.  Several books and television movies are planned, although the response of the networks is not known.  Two civil suits by former defendants are underway and Mrs. Buckey said she plans to sue.

It quickly overran the Kuwaiti capital and then continued on to southern oil facilities.  The United States led the United Nations in condemning this action and imposing tough economic and military sanctions.","Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions by exceeding OPEC production quotas thus driving down oil prices.  He further accused Kuwait of ""stealing"" Iraqi oil from a common oil field on their border.  He then invaded Kuwait, claiming to do so at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  The United States led the western world and the United Nations in calling the coup a sham, denouncing this invasion and imposing strong economic and military sanctions on Iraq in an attempt to get them to withdraw.  Oil prices surged while Saddam warned against foreign intervention.  The U.S. dispatched warships to the area.","It appeared that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his countries financial problems and territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  Iraq emerged from its 1980-1988 war with Iran with a debt of approximately $80 billion.  Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions in oil revenues by exceeding OPEC assigned oil quotas, thus driving down the price of oil.  He further accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from an oil field common to their border and also of conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq economically and militarily.  Breaking off perfunctory negotiations with Kuwait, Iraq invaded, claiming it responded to a request for help from Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  Iraq quickly overwhelmed a mismatched Kuwaiti military, captured the capital and continued south to the oil facilities.  The United States called the coup a farce.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador asked the United States to intervene militarily.  U.S. President George Bush called for an ""immediate and unconditional"" withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  Although not willing to publicly discuss military options, Bush said all U.S. options remained open.  His administration led a United Nations embargo of Iraqi exports, including oil, and Iraqi imports.  Iraq retaliated by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait.",Saddam Hussein Defied United States and United Nations,"On August 2, 1990, after Saddam Hussein had charged Kuwait with unfriendly acts, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic moves by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq remained defiant and moved troops toward the Saudi Arabian border. As of August 6, 1990 the situation was ominous.","In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border. The two countries agreed to talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives walked out. The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of them to Iraq. As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.","On July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPECproduction quotas and of stealing oil from wells along the countries'disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a""short-notice exercise"" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would notbe intimidated by U.S. pressure. Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwaitagreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq hadmassed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. The next day Iraq pulledout of the talks and on August 2,1990 invaded and quickly occupied allof Kuwait. President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blockedmost Iraqi imports. The U.N. Security Council denounced the invasionand demanded Iraq's withdrawal. The Pentagon stepped up air patrolsand movement of warships into the Persian Gulf. When, on August 6, theU.S.  pushed strong sanctions against Iraq through the U.N.

march to refrain from promot aspirin as a prevent of first heart attack, at least for now. a studi publish in januari indic an aspirin everi other day reduc the risk of nonfat, first heart attack 47% in 11,000 male doctor over five year, compar with 11,000 who took a non-aspirin substitut. aspirin tend to promot bleed by reduc the abil of blood platelet to help form clot. heart attack usual occur when clot form in the arteri nourish the heart and choke off it blood suppli. but aspirin may increas health risk for peopl who alreadi have clot problem, or for those who have high blood pressur, which put them at increas risk for hemorrhag stroke, the fda commentari said. stroke are the result of brain damag caus by bleed in the brain or by blood clots; hemorrhag stroke are those caus by bleed. the fda commentari point to 10 hemorrhag stroke record among the 11,000 subject take aspirin in the recent studi, compar with two such stroke among 11,000 subject take the substitut. overal death rate for the two group were the same, though the aspirin group' nonfat heart-attack rate wa much lower. there were 104 nonfat heart attack among the aspirin user and 189 in the comparison group. ""physician, will, for a time, be forc to make their profession judgment about aspirin use on the basi of incomplet information,"" said the fda commentari, co-written by agenc director dr. frank e. young. ""we agre with them completely,"" said dr. juli bure, a harvard univers research who particip in the aspirin studi. she ad in a telephon interview yesterday that an extens of the studi is under way, and research expect to report to the fda in late fall. the commentari note a british studi, also releas in januari, of 5,000 male physician that found that aspirin fail to protect against heart attack, and that it wa associ with a 2 1/2-fold increas in disabl strokes.a drug use to treat patient complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recur heart attack infour out of five heart patient, accord to a studi publish intoday' edit of the new england journal of medicine.surprisingli, howev, the studi found that the drug, diltiazem,increas the chanc of a subsequ heart attack in patient whoseheart pump abnorm, expert said.even so, the result may trigger an increas in the use of thedrug, which is now primarili use to treat angina, doctor said.th drug wa test in 38 hospit in the unit state andcanada on patient who had recent suffer a heart attack, saiddr. arthur moss, a clinic professor of medicin at the universityof rochest and the princip investig for the study.th result suggest the drug may be quit effect indecreas the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majorityof patient, moss said. but the studi also surprisingli suggeststhat patient who suffer pulmonari congest should not be givendiltiazem becaus the drug increas the chanc of a subsequentheart attack.w now know when to prescrib thi drug and when not to,moss said. that' what thi studi wa all about.diltiazem is a calcium entri blocker, the newest class of drugsto be introduc in the fight against heart diseas. nitrat andbeta blocker are the other type commonli prescrib by doctors.th studi involv 2,466 heart attack patient, who were giveneith 240 milligram of diltiazem a day or a placebo. patientswer recruit from 1983 to 1986 and follow for 12 to 52 months.overal, the drug onli decreas addit heart attack 11percent, which wa not statist signific, moss said.but in patient who had normal or near-norm heart pumpfunct 1,909 patient or 80 percent of the total group diltiazem decreas the chanc of anoth heart attack by 25percent, moss said.in patient whose heart had pump problem, the drug not onlydidn't help, but it increas the chanc of a heart attack by 25percentdr. john schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at stanfordunivers, said he wa surpris that the drug increas thechanc of heart attack in ani group and that overal result werenot higher.but the bottom line is that thi is the first studi to showthat diltiazem can be effect, schroeder said. i think itwil mean that more patient will be routin put on thi drug ona long-term basisdr. georg beller, a cardiologist and professor at theunivers of virginia, said he wa also somewhat surpris aboutth increas in heart attack in the group suffer pulmonarycongestion.thi is one of the first report that seem to identifythat, he said.diltiazem and two other calcium entri blocker were introducedin the past decad, beller said, and research into how effectivethey are in variou applic is in it earli stages.nitr have been use for more than 50 year, and betablock were develop in the 1960s.aspirin sale jump 41 percent for a few weeksearli thi year, not becaus of a rash of headaches.a studi of more than 22,000 male doctor had shown that take asingl aspirin everi other day could cut heart attack risk in half.th studi wa one of a seri of recent report show for thefirst time that doctor are abl not onli to treat heart attack but also to prevent them.in the most recent report, doctor found that one aspirin tabletand a singl dose of a clot-dissolv drug given within 24 hourscan dramat cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.without the treatment, patient had a 13 percent chanc of dyingfrom a second heart attack within five week, the researchersfound. with the treatment, the figur drop to 8 percent.th real discoveri is that treatment for patient is go toreduc in-hospit mortal substanti, say richard peto ofoxford univers, one of the study' authors.heart diseas is the nation' lead caus of death, by far.th nation center for health statist report that 762,820american die of heart diseas in 1987.to put it anoth way: of the 2,127,000 american who die thatyear, more than one in three die of heart diseas.

treatment, he says.whil most public attent ha focus on thi new abil toprev heart attack, research have also made importantprogress in speed the recoveri of patient who surviv heartattacks.research at the univers of michigan recent determinedthat some heart attack victim can be releas from the hospit assoon as three day after their heart attack. most heart attacksvictim are kept in the hospit for at least seven to 10 days.th patient given earli discharg were abl to return to worktwo week sooner than other in the studi group. after six months,not one death wa record in the early-discharg group. theresearch conclud that perhap 15 percent of heart attacksvictim could be safe discharg after three days.in juli, stanford univers doctor found that worker who wentback to their job about seven week after their heart attack didat least as well as worker who went back after a more typicalconvalesc of about 10 or 11 weeks.al of these advanc come at a time when public health expertsar increasingli

Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

Meanwhile vigorous lobbying of the entire Senate by pro- and anti-Thomas groups proceeded.","From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Thomas's refusal to answer certain questions caused complaints, but it appeared early on that the committee would approve the nomination. By the end of the questioning an affirmative vote of 10-4 or 9-5 was predicted. There was media attention to Thomas's wife Virginia. A successful Washington lawyer, she had taken strong conservative positions that antagonized certain groups and the fact that she was white and he black raised questions for some blacks. During the hearings lobbyists on either side worked to influence the ensuing vote of the full Senate.","From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, underwent five days of intensive questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Although it seemed likely that the committee would vote to confirm the nomination, some members complained that the candidate refused to answer certain questions and seemed to back away from statements that he had made in the past. By the end of the questioning it appeared that Thomas would be confirmed by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote. In the media Thomas's wife Virginia was presented as an issue. Virginia had an impressive career as a lawyer in Washington, often taking strong conservative positions. She is white while Clarence is black. Women's-rights activists objected to her opposition to comparable-worth legislation; some religious groups were wary of her anti-cult activities; and some blacks viewed the Thomases' marriage as indicating his rejection of the black community. Throughout the hearings the entire Senate came under pressure from groups supporting or opposing the nomination. Pro-Thomas groups included the Coalition for the Restoration of the Black Family and Society and the Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas. Opposing were the National Abortion Rights Action League and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.",Thomas' confirmation as second black justice in history of Supreme Court.,"Clarence Thomas completed five days of grueling days of testimony, apparently well on his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.

And photographer William Wegman's Weimaraners are, through his work, know to artists and children around the world.  And like other international championship events, sometimes lawyers and court are involved.","At dog shows throughout the world, proud owners compete their charges for the awards and glory that await the champions.

However, not all ""famous"" dogs are show dogs.  Sharing the limelight at Sardi's was Nero, New York City's top police dog.  Nero helped the police make hundreds of arrests and apprehend more than 50 felons.  And one need only look at the renown attained by photographer William Wegman's Weimaraners.

Millions watch the televised presentation of awards worth millions to film studios.","The Oscar nomination and selection process is under scrutiny as studios campaign to influence voting by Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences members. Directors  Brooks (1988),  Spielberg (1988), and Lee (1989) are among the luminaries who were overlooked in the annual voting during the award's 61-year history.Millions watch the televised awards show which can take over three hours. The 1989 show is memorable for the number of films honored and for a musical number that sparked a Disney suit against the Academy.The highly recognizable statue is not protected by copyright. Walt Disney was the most-awarded person (32).","Director Spike Lee, speaking at Syracuse University Monday, shrugged off the treatment of his movie by Academy Award voters. Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories. The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers. In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.  Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting. On average a best picture award is worth about $20 million, but there is no guarantee that Academy members actually complete their own ballots.Millions watch the awards presentation. The last awards show took a long three plus hours. The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character. Though long, the 1989 ceremony will be favorably remembered for the spread of the awards. Ten movies split 17 awards. The Oscar, created in 1928, is one of the most recognizable symbols in the entertainment world and is not protected by copyright. Katherine Hepburn and Walter Brennan are the actress and actor, respectively, with the most awards.","High-stakes Oscar is prized, promoted, presented with pomp, and protected","Oscars increase film earnings, prompting studios to woo votes.

Customers in Yugoslavia, the firstcommunist country to get a McDonald's, and China raved about the taste of the Big Mac.In Moscow, the Russians were less enthusiastic about its taste but gave a thumbs up tothe shakes. The openings came after long negotiations which, in most cases, sawMcDonald's contracting with local farmers for the beef, potatoes and other suppliesneeded for its restaurants.","McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets. After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.

In 1988, seven years after its first attempt to bring a restaurant to South Korea, McDonald's successfully joint-ventured with Ahn Hyo Young, a Harvard schooled entrepreneur. McAhn Enterprises Ltd. had to fight government red tape and develop local suppliers in order to open in Seoul.  That year, Big Mac also braved the communist world.  On March 24, 1988, McDonald's successfully opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  Its local competition was the hamburger-like pljeskavica, i.e., ground pork and onion served on bread and eaten by hand.  Two years later, McDonald's had their most successful opening ever, worldwide.  In Pushkin Square, Moscow, thousands of people waited in line for hours at the largest McDonald's in the world for hamburgers, fries and shakes.

concerned world watches a divided Germany unite.,"With growing numbers of disgruntled East Germans emigrating to West Germany, the idea of reunification seemed possible and became actively discussed among western leaders.  Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.  All European and Jewish issues were addressed.  Reunification occurred.",East's Economy Sagging. Soviets Endorse German Reunification. World Awaits Change,"Woeful economic conditions and massive demonstrations in East Germany gave impetusto German reunification. Soviet endorsement of reunification in 1990 made it imminent.Many perceived a strong unified Germany as a danger, but that was accepted as a lesserthreat than East Germany in turmoil.","East Germany was near chaos by the end of 1989. Woeful economic conditionsprevailed. Massive demonstrations for democratic reform swept the nation. The hard-lineCommunist government admitted its failure, giving strong impetus to the Germanreunification movement. The Soviets endorsed it in February as the World War II Alliesdid later. Unification was now imminent.The specter of an economically and politically powerful Germany disturbed many, butparticularly the Poles, Soviets and world Jewry. Despite concerns, reunification would beaccepted as a lesser threat than a chaotic East Germany.","Through the first three months of 1989, 80,00 East Germans fled their country, andmassive demonstrations raised doubts that Erich Honeker the, hard-line Communistleader could resist the democratic reforms sweeping his country. Street demonstrationsoccurred throughout East Germany in November 1989, and the East German CommunistParty was forced to admit the its system had failed.The West German constitution called for a united Germany, but it received little attentionuntil late 1989. The specter of a powerful undivided Germany troubled many, butparticularly the Soviets and Poles.Matters moved quickly in early 1990. Soviet President Gorbachev gave West Germanyan unequivocal promise that German reunification would be honored. Two days later, onthe 12th of February, said that negotiations with East Germany should begin as soon aspossible after the 18 March East German elections. In time the World War II Allieswould endorse reunification.With reunification imminent, world Jewish leaders asked for guarantees that theHolocaust would not be repeated. Most prominent American historians agreed that astable Germany was a lesser threat to stability than the woeful conditions and near chaosin East Germany.",,,,

His National Guard service and campaign gaffes were attacked. He proved a low-profile team player and Bush announced he would be on the 1992 ticket. Quayle's grandfather owned the newspaper in Quayle's hometown of Huntington. Quayle, known always as a nice guy, graduated from DePauw in 1969, took National Guard training, then in 1971 worked in the Indiana Attorney General's office and for the governor. At Indiana University Law School he met and married his wife Marilyn. They practiced law together before Quayle spent 12 years in Congress. They have three children.","Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, was the surprise choice of Republican George Bush for  presidential running mate in 1988. Quayle was compared to John F. Kennedy because of their similar ages and congressional service, and to Robert Redford in appearance. Quayle was criticized as a novice and his National Guard service attacked. His campaign gaffes made news, but he was loyal to Bush and a team player. After controversies subsided he kept a low profile. A year after the election he agreed to be on ""Meet the Press"", shortly after Bush announced he would be on the ticket in 1992, and was uncontroversial. Quayle grew up in Huntington, Indiana, population 17,000, where his grandfather owned the newspaper. He graduated from DePauw University in 1969, spent six months in National Guard training, then in 1971 investigated consumer problems in the Indiana Attorney General's office and became an aide to the governor. While attending Indiana University Law School he met and married his wife Marilyn. They jointly practiced law in Huntington before Quayle spent 12 years in the US Congress. Quayle has three children and is known as a nice guy with good values. In 1991, Huntington hosted an exhibit in his honor, which he didn't attend because of a busy schedule.","Bush, friends support Quayle despite errors and political inexperience",George Bush's selection of Dan Quayle as his running mate surprised many.Many political observers thought him a lightweight with baggage to carry.Bush continued to voice support for him even though Quayle was given only avery small role in the campaign and was not highly visible as vicepresident.,"George Bush's choice of Dan Quayle as his running mate surprised mostpolitical observers, but was quickly supported by many of Quayle's fellowRepublican senators. Quayle was viewed as a lightweight and questions wereraised about his military service and errors in his official resume. Hismain attributes were party loyalty and identification as a devoted familyman.  Quayle contributed little to the campaign and, after being elected,all but disappeared from the political scene.  President Bush, however,continued to voice support for, and confidence in Quayle.  His friends,especially in his home town, called him a winner.","George Bush's choice of Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate,surprised most political observers.  Despite service in Congress andSenate, he was looked upon as lacking the experience and mettle for avigorous national campaign.  Several Republican senators rallied support.Senator John Warner of Virginia compared Quayle to Thomas Jefferson.Senator Bob Dole in nominating Quayle at the Republican Convention, calledhim a dedicated public servant and devoted family man and cited his supportfor the Reagan program.Devotion to family and friends was a theme voiced by those who had knownQuayle for many years. Relatives and friends believed that if Quayle wereelected, he and his family would remain a strong unit.Questions arose regarding Quayle's fitness for the job, and there were somesuggestions that he should withdraw.  He had called himself a ""Vietnam-eraveteran"" which angered some actual combat veterans.  Quayle's service was in the National Guard, a position he apparently gained through familyinfluence.  Quayle's resume contained a reference to a position held inIndiana, two years before it was created.Quayle survived these criticisms but did not play a strong role in thecampaign or as vice president.

The guardhouse, constructed after erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was the scene of many successful and unsuccessful attempts at escape from East Berlin and had become a symbol of the Cold War. By June of 1990 with the Berlin Wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, and with top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city after unification, U.S. officials decided it was time to remove the famous landmark. The foreign ministers attended an elaborate ceremony to honor the symbolic act. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze took the occasion to modify the previous Soviet firm opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, proposing that such a step be allowed after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. U.S. Secretary of State Baker declared himself ""underwhelmed"" by the offer, but softening of the Soviet position was a welcome sign appropriate to the occasion.",The Cold War ends as Checkpoint Charlie is lifted into history.,"As a U.S. army band played and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, Checkpoint Charlie, the symbol of the Cold War, was lifted into history today.

Secretary of State James Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol, expressed the hope that its removal would bury the conflicts it created. The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous. Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany. Among the invited guests was West Germany's Chancellor Willy Brandt who was mayor of Berlin in the 1960s.",,,,
