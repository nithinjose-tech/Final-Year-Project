0,d116i,"Five astronauts boarded Discovery today second try sending Hubble Space Telescope orbit scan outermost reaches universe clues beginning time. Astronomers starting tingle anticipation Hubble able accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head NASA science activities. Air Force forecasters said 90 percent chance weather would favorable launching shuttle scheduled time 8:31 a.m. EDT. More half million gallons liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen pumped space ship's fuel tanks midnight. The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed crew cabin dawn breaking Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, give astronomers new set eyes ears have, said William Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program. It's going change perspective altogether. I can't say we're going learn, I'll astounded learn many new things. Discovery aiming altitude 380 miles, highest shuttle ever gone, telescope placed proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. It 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, journeys space next month Astro observatory, sat launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery, second time pads occupied; first 1986 Challenger explosion. Hubble waiting take place space 1983, delayed technical problems Challenger accident. The latest postponement occurred April 10, Discovery's launch scrubbed four minutes liftoff faulty power unit shuttle. The mood Kennedy Space Center considerably less festive first launch attempt, hundreds astronomers gathered families. The day launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley use shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescope space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II Kathryn Sullivan assist problem develops. Discovery follow Hubble 40 miles away two days lens cap opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Hubble expected start providing scientific data satellite month liftoff. However, NASA said release first image  open star cluster constellation Carina  week launch. In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million spent spare parts, astronaut training computer software operate instrument. The European Space Agency contributed $250 million 15 percent viewing time. NASA estimates cost $200 million year operate maintain telescope space. During 15-year working lifetime, telescope provide astronomers 10 times better resolution 25 times sensitivity ground-based observatories. As result, able study stars galaxies distant light traveling Earth 14 billion years. Astronomers hope learn whether universe created 15 billion years ago believed uncover mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes quasars. Hubble also expected shed light universe might end. The telescope named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, discovered 1920s universe expanding. His work gave rise Big Bang theory universe created tremendous explosion. In addition Hubble, Discovery carries human skull filled sensors measure space radiation astronauts receive. It skull's third trip space. The shuttle end five-day mission landing Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday second attempt launch shuttle NASA's valuable celebrated payload, $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery scheduled lift 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. We feel confident things going go well time, said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're going come OK Tuesday morning and, not, we'll keep trying do. That's kind name game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday countdown proceeding smoothly shuttle appeared perfect condition. The countdown got way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit forced first launch attempt scrubbed four minutes liftoff April 10. The unit replaced new one, tests showed fine. Hopefully, we'll get shuttle pad time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance favorable weather expected launch time, low clouds main concern, said Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front north expected pass area Monday night. The outlook considerably better Wednesday Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronauts arrived Johnson Space Center Houston early Sunday afternoon, shuttle Columbia transported launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery. It second time shuttle launch pads Kennedy Space Center occupied simultaneously. The first time January 1986; 16 days Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand said believe National Aeronautics Space Administration moving fast shuttle. NASA expects launch Columbia astronomical observatory called Astro earlier May 16, one week later planned Discovery's two-week delay. In cases, could problem shuttles launch pads, Brand said. In particular case, everything's fitting together. NASA Saturday get Discovery ground. After that, launch attempts must halted eight days Hubble's batteries recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries power Hubble time disconnected Discovery's electrical system two energy-collecting solar panels take space. Discovery's payload bay sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing risk contamination telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery aim altitude 380 miles, highest shuttle ever gone, telescope placed proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey space, astronomers expect look back nearly beginning time solve universe's perplexing mysteries. Astro measure ultraviolet radiation undetected Hubble thus provide additional targets telescope. The $100 million observatory also focus Columbia's nine-day mission Comet Austin, believed first trip solar system. Both Hubble Astro scheduled launch 1986, delayed Challenger accident. The Hubble Space Telescope awakened self-induced sleep today still use high-speed antennas, science instruments hold, unable begin observations. We `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, supervisor engineers controlling telescope. He said telescope running normal control-all mode, computers sensors guide pointing. Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed gear return Earth Sunday, made last-minute observations Earth talked ground-based reporters flight. Pilot Charles Bolden said especially upbeat widespread public awareness telescope, expected eventually look back 14 billion light years  nearly birth universe. It's hard go somewhere find someone never heard Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want learn add subtract study science. The telescope's big eye remained open, Hubble safe mode motion stopped earlier problems linking high-speed dish antennas relay satellite. The antennas primary links relaying scientific data ground. Terry said safe mode, one tape recorders telescope reads telemetry signals systems would played Earth analyzed antennas working properly. We expect use data investigate happened, said. Engineers able send commands telescope secondary antennas communications system useful scientific data, must transmitted high rate speed. We're putting scientific instruments hold mode, effect standby mode, said. Shortly 6 a.m. EDT, controllers Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md., completed series commands took telescope safe mode began run 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health. It take another day $1.5 billion telescope operating way supposed point startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're backing deliberate slow careful approach problems, Olivier said Friday. This time anything dumb. The telescope problems put flight center several days behind, five astronauts deployed earlier week sticking schedule. Landing scheduled 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., flight controllers keeping close watch weather. Winds predicted 20 mph gusts 29 mph. Mission rules dictate headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph touchdown. The shuttle carries enough supplies stay orbit three days Sunday necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awakened crew members 1:30 a.m. EDT today playing song, Cosmos. Thanks wake-up music, pretty appropriate today, said Commander Loren Shriver. The song selected honor Hubble Space Telescope, open business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronauts finish experiments photography today pack trip home. They also planned hold news conference space reporters Johnson Space Center. Shriver pilot Charles Bolden run series tests make certain shuttle's computers control jets ready return Earth. The crew deployed Hubble Wednesday stayed close telescope case trouble opening aperture door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan prepared perform space walk today crank open orbit 380 miles Earth. But proved unnecessary door opened Friday morning, exposing telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye starlight first time. Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working door opened, engineers later got back line. The gyroscopes knocked motion that, too, kept telescope safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director orbital verifications Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems set conservative limits first operations caused many malfunctions. There also two communications outages totaling several hours. Hubble designed safe modes master destiny case contact orbiting communications system lost extended periods, Terry said. NASA planned release first test image telescope Tuesday, showing open star cluster constellation Carina. But Terry said would delayed antenna problems. Scientific data follow month two. The telescope, named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, enable astronomers 15-year working lifetime look back 14 billion years possibly determine age universe. The universe believed created 15 billion years ago cosmic explosion. Hubble provided basis big-bang theory creation. He discovered 1920s universe expanding farther galaxy Earth, faster moving away. After years delay last-minute snag, Hubble Space Telescope freed shuttle Discovery Wednesday and, glinting sunlight, drifted orbit 15-year search new worlds. Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble end shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm delay getting one telescope's solar wings unfurled. The first NASA's great observatories station 330 nautical miles Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really looked great flew away it, sure hope good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later. The $1.5 billion telescope released 3:38 p.m. EDT shuttle entered 20th orbit Earth, nearly two hours one orbit later planned. The shuttle backed away. Thank much ride, said Mike Harrington, director orbital verifications Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan shuttle's airlock, ready walk inspace free solar panel. That proved unnecessary. Close cigar, better Hubble went way did, Sullivan said. She McCandless trained nearly five years make rescue mission. The first solar array unreeled mast midday Wednesday shuttle passed 380 statute miles, 330 nautical miles, South America's eastern coast. It started providing power telescope's batteries, otherwise eight hours charge. Deployment starboard panel, however, troublesome. It budge latches first released, moved fifth 39-foot length, stopped again. A third attempt rolled panel way. Houston, see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley began long process releasing Hubble shortly 7 a.m. EDT grasped Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm carefully hoisted 12{-ton telescope high shuttle. Hubble taken shuttle electrical power lifted cargo bay operating nickel-hydrogen batteries. At one day, seven minutes flight Discovery, Hubble internal power, Carr said. The game begun. The race on. The clock ticking. Worries telescope's instruments would starved electricity eased first solar panel stretched out. Television cameras Discovery showed first array pulled reel slowly steadily, sun reflecting gold-colored panel silvery telescope. Discovery 380 statute miles Earth, 70 miles higher shuttle ever flown. The orbit dictated need put telescope Earth's distorting atmosphere. Discovery's five astronauts awed view. I'd pass quote day on-board astronomer something effect big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said Hawley. Astronomers waited seven years Hubble take place space. The telescope originally scheduled launch 1983, technical problems Challenger explosion pushed back. The mission delayed another two weeks faulty power unit Discovery forced National Aeronautics Space Administration halt first launch attempt four minutes April 10's scheduled liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted space, transporting Hubble world search others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door opened Friday, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Discovery Hubble case door open properly. If problem develops, McCandless Sullivan prepared walk space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said telescope would tested Thursday ability maneuever aperture door opened. We want full control ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, said. The telescope cannot focus sun sensitivity five instruments. If goes well, crew land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects release first image telescope  open star cluster constellation Carina  Tuesday. Data follow month two. Astronomers hope look back almost beginning time, studying stars galaxies distant light traveling Earth 14 billion years. They expect determine precisely universe formed, currently estimated 15 billion years ago. The telescope named late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, discovered 1920s universe expanding. He also responsible helping form Big Bang theory creation. Ground controllers Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today two main antennas $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope trying six hours lock on. Applause erupted Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md., glitch marred Hubble's first full day space solved. We confirmation achieved communication Tracking Data Relay Satellite high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers said believed antennas working right problem incorrectly pointing either satellite TDRS, orbiting communications satellite acts switchboard. In successful attempt, nearly doubled width antennas' beams take territory, sweep 6.2 degrees 10.8 degrees. The telescope's low-gain antennas, receive transmit information much slower rate used emergencies, working well. Space shuttle Discovery 46 miles away, available remedy certain problems. The outage problem space walkers would summoned. The five astronauts otherwise busy making pictures storms Texas 380-mile-high perch, experiments. Steve Terry, director team calibrating various aspects telescope, said first outage caused human error serious problem. It began 1 1:30 a.m. EDT lasted 45 minutes hour, said. The second failure occurred 6:44 a.m. controllers attempted send signal telescope's two high-gain antennas TDRS. This time pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, Goddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft think inexperience dealing cause. The telescope, embarking 15-year search new worlds, released shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minute snag almost sent two astronauts emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awakened crew early today loud rendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite. Good morning, Discovery. I guess awake song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There lot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday Hubble good night asleep. We appreciate good words everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away telescope put shuttle series maneuvers, last one completed morning, park Discovery orbit 46 miles Hubble. The telescope really looked great flew away it, sure hope good work, Shriver said Wednesday. Well, sure now, Loren, thanks great work done, replied Mission Control. Galileo real proud you. Scientists hailed Hubble  NASA's expensive unmanned spacecraft  greatest advance astronomy Galileo raised small telescope eyes nearly 400 years ago. Discovery five astronauts follow telescope controllers Goddard center make sure Hubble operating properly, responding directional commands. The next milestone Friday, telescope's 10-foot aperture door opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Then Tuesday, NASA expects release first image telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina. Data follow month two. If aperture door open properly, Discovery could return telescope two astronauts could perform spacewalk fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said telescope would tested today ability maneuver aperture door opened. We want full control ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, said. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitive instruments. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used shuttle's 50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope hoist cargo bay. One telescope's solar arrays unreeled mast expected started providing power telescope's batteries, otherwise eight hours charge. But trouble second panel. It budge latches released, moved fifth 39-foot length stopped again. The panel rolled way third attempt. By final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan space suits airlock, 30 minutes away taking tools hand going outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik said cause problem unknown. The 8{-hour procedure performed 380 miles Earth, 70 miles higher shuttle ever flown. The orbit dictated need put Hubble Earth's distorting atmosphere. Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost beginning time, studying stars galaxies distant light taken 14 billions years reach Earth. They hope determine universe formed, currently estimated 15 billion years ago. The telescope originally scheduled launch 1983 delayed technical problems Challenger accident. Discovery, blasted orbit Tuesday, scheduled land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven years late, Hubble Space Telescope belongs, world search distant may formed beginning time. Less five hours rode space shuttle Discovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope sent first test radio signal. At sign life, applause cheers erupted Mission Control Houston. As tell, everything looks perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesday drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space. Discovery, trailing arc white smoke brilliant blue sky, carried silver-colored telescope orbit 380 miles Earth  higher 70 miles previous shuttle. There Hubble stay search yet-unseen wonders creation instruments look 14 billion years backward time. Our window universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted Discovery rose seaside launch pad. It's beautiful day Hubble Space Telescope orbit instead Earth many years, said NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's element I'm delighted. The telescope supposed launched 1983, technical problems Challenger accident delayed deployment. It suffered delay two weeks ago countdown stopped four-minutes-to-go point faulty hydraulic unit shuttle. While remained Earth, telescope cost $7 million month exercise keep readiness. In first day space, checkout testing continued remotely control Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland. On hand watch Discovery launching contingent scientists hailed Hubble greatest advance astronomy Galileo raised small telescope eyes nearly 400 years ago. Truly referred early-day astronomer asked long delays getting telescope working station. Somebody day said, `Who remembers day Galileo picked telescope look stars?' said Truly, former shuttle astronaut. It matter day launch Hubble, matters right. The telescope 43 feet long 14 feet diameter, size railroad tank car. When flies free, receive electrical power six scientific instruments two wing-like solar arrays extend outward side. It named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, theorized universe expanding farther away galaxy is, faster traveling. That gave support theory massive explosion  Big Bang  created universe 10 20 billion years ago. The Hubble expected help provide answer two major questions: How old universe? How big it? The telescope two mirrors, one 94.5 inches diameter, 12 inches. Two instruments cameras, two spectrometers one photometer. In addition, fine pointing system acts sixth instrument providing precise measurement distances. On Wednesday, Hawley grapple 12{-ton telescope shuttle's mechanical arm, lift cargo bay, point it,  long checkout  drop overboard orbit own. In cargo bay, telescope receives electrical power shuttle. But juice cut instrument lifted depend internal batteries solar panels extended receive light sun. Should solar panels deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan standing by, partially dressed space suits, ready go open cargo bay unfurl arrays manually. Discovery's launch problems. With 31 seconds left countdown, computer runs final moments liftoff refused close fuel valve stopped launch process. The problem overcome shuttle lifted 8:34 a.m. EDT, three minutes late. The shuttle scheduled land Sunday 9:49 a.m. EDT Edwards Air Force Base California. On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, shuttle's windshield splattered several flecks things. He said windshield streaked debris also smeared spent booster rockets fell climb orbit. The astronauts also problems UHF radio circuit, one ship's small rear thrusters inoperative. Neither problem considered serious. The shuttle put Hubble Space Telescope orbit also carries instrument used 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble: eyepiece world's powerful telescope. It's great pleasure something historical significance something directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday circled Earth space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope carried orbit Sullivan. After brings eyepiece back Earth, placed display observatory. It's basically symbolic gesture astronomy future astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group runs observatory, located San Gabriel Mountains Los Angeles. The discoveries made Hubble 100-inch telescope Mount Wilson gave us giant leap forward understanding universe, McAfee said. We believe Hubble Space Telescope thing. The Hooker Telescope world's powerful telescope construction 1918 1948, 200-inch Hale Telescope placed operation Mount Palomar Observatory northeast San Diego. Using Hooker Telescope, Hubble first determine distance galaxy Milky Way, institute said statement. This crucial discovery provided first definite proof galaxies existed far confines local galaxy, institute said. During 1920s 1930s, Hubble assistant used Hooker telescope take thousands photographs faint galaxies, showing moving away quickly. This provided observational evidence concept, suggested Einstein's Theory Relativity, universe expanding, institute said. Hubble's work helped convince scientists universe created giant explosion, called big bang, estimated 15 billion years ago. The Hooker Telescope mothballed 1985 Carnegie Institution, former operator observatory, money-saving move. The institute hopes obtain funds reopen it.","AP900424-0048,AP900422-0032,LA042590-0152,AP900428-0050,LA042290-0160,AP900425-0198,AP900426-0135,AP900424-0096,LA042590-0135,AP900428-0022",The shuttle Discovery triumphantly launches the Hubble Space Telescope.,"Two weeks after an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery roared from Cape Canaveral into orbit 380 statute miles above earth.

While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth, it will provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled.  Once released, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  However, scientists, optimistic that the Hubble will soon be operational, authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return home.","Following an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  Named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who did pioneering work leading to the ""Big Bang"" concept of the universe, it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime, it will provide astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.

Police said bomb exploded crowded trade residential district Bowbazaar shortly midnight, causing two blocks flats collapse trapping 70 people rubble. The identity bombers unknown explosion comes five days 250 people killed least 1,200 injured series bomb attacks aimed heart Indian business capital Bombay. A militant Sikh group fighting independence Indian state Punjab claimed responsibility Bombay blasts, police unconvinced, saying carried foreign group connivance 'local criminals'. In many interpreted reference Pakistan, India fought three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, federal home (interior) minister, told parliament New Delhi suspected 'an international conspiracy.' Most estimated 125 people living Calcutta flats beds blast occurred, setting fire buildings, according officials city's central control room. At least 45 people dead arrival hospital, said. Last Friday series car bombs exploded Bombay government described systematic attack India's commercial heart. Among targets Bombay Stock Exchange, landmark Air India building, shopping complex, two hotels airport. The attacks Calcutta Bombay severe setback attempts heal wounds created recent intercommunal violence, caused deep shock throughout India. More 2,000 people died riots, including 700 Bombay, razing mosque Ayodhya northern India Hindu zealots December 6. Some fear wave bomb attacks designed stir renewal communal strife undermine efforts government Mr P V Narasimha Rao open economy attract foreign investment tourism. Last night national local state leaders appealed calm attempt prevent renewed outbreak violence. Mr Rao urged nation ignore rumours 'inhuman criminal blast'. A ROW erupted Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, Securities Exchange Board India, securities watchdog, board's recent first-ever inspection stockbrokers' books. The Sebi accused stockbrokers flouting exchange's rules, including regulations margin trading designed limit risk members defaulting excessive speculative investments. It also accused exchange authorities failing enforce rules poor administration. The stock exchange denied allegations, saying 'baseless, made context blown proportion.' The argument nothing restore investors' faith stock market where, measured Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares fallen 48 cent peak early last year, including 320 points fall government's budget announced two weeks ago. Yesterday index closed 2330. Foreign investors, wooed India source much-needed capital, also concerned latest allegations poor management exchange. In one damaging passages, inspectors' report alleges D S Prabhoodas, leading firm headed Mr Hemendra Kothari, former BSE president, Mr Jaswant Chotalal, member BSE's governing body, avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 4.08m). Mr Kothari said yesterday transactions covered report off-exchange deals directly financial institutions margin payments required.

Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers dodge taxes also contributed last year's securities market scandal banks, including UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost combined gross total Rs40bn. The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home Bombay Stock Exchange, rocked two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead 200 injured. The market reopened Monday attempt return normal. It compromise - trading restricted hour day, dealing moved back traditional ring, stopped year ago. Dealers seemed this, BSE index rising 5.6 cent Monday Tuesday. But another bomb blast Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday, index came back 50.62, 2.1 cent, 2,409.23. All taken place volatile background: Bombay equity market, six weeks so, contend first unusually bullish speculation, national budget February 27, subsequently savage expressions disappointment. Dr Manmohan Singh, Indian finance minister, disappointed traders budget end last month. He postponed corporate tax reforms year, denying hopes tax cut recommended expert group. He reduce excise import duties broad front, left cement steel sectors, share prices boosted pre-budget speculation. To top all, Dr Singh refused equate domestic investors overseas counterparts taxing short-term capital gains. He lowered tax 30 cent 65 cent expatriate Indians foreign investors local investors remained 44.5 cent. Taking tax concessions granted, traders driven share prices February make kill later. Instead, budget turned nightmare. While industry business welcomed statement which, once, propose new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, stock market theorist academic, said reduction import duties would leave corporate profits ex-growth year. The relative lack financial concessions meant disappointed traders sold vengeance and, weekend, market seemed bottomless equity prices plummeted 13-month low. Overseas investors fuelled downtrend sold half million shares Reliance Industries, arbitraging share price Bombay stock exchange market price Euro-issue global depository receipts (GDRs).

Last week, the Securities and Exchange Board of India completed its first inspection of the books and accused the market of ignoring and failing to enforce rules.

The Indian market already had fallen 48 percent since early last year, aggravated by a negative reaction to the Indian budget, which helped foreign and expatriate investors, but did not provide the expected tax relief to local industry.  On Friday afternoon, the BSE, along with other Bombay commercial centers, was hit with car bombs.  These attacks struck at the heart of India's commerce, seemingly aimed at undermining government efforts to expand foreign investment and tourism.

2,d120i,"THE revelation John Major capable candid, blunt salty language talking off-the- record friendly journalists surprised people. It suggested recording prime minister's conversation Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, Major used variety four-, six- eight-letter words communicate lack fondness certain colleagues, may good. With luck, reckoned, Major's image leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction. What piffle. Major gonner, especially week's revolt wooden-tops Christchurch by-election, Conservative majority 23,015 last year's general election converted 16,427 majority Liberal Democrats. Fifteen months late, voters Christchurch rounded Tories malignant squeaky fury. In reality, politicians, Major, far candid salty chatting private speaking public. In public, careful say, utterances achieve horrible mattness. But private relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words become nonsensical. They swear joke shout. It really spectacle. To show I mean, I spoke yesterday John Major John Smith. Smith, Scot, leader Labour Party, though many people know that. In aftermath Christchurch, Labour lost deposit, I wanted provoke two Johns spot real soul-searching. To guarantee privacy, I used signal-scrambler. No one could eavesdropped. Their responses true form. But I left swear-words new Financial Times Style Guide states 'the gratuitous use expletives obscenities discouraged . . . Four-letter expletives confined infrequent use review (Arts) pages.' I live that, though artsy-fartsies receive dispensation puzzle. First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did read, John, Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson Robert Solow wrote, one article, FT week? They describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies exchange rate arrangements. They pull punches. I bet went chalk-white. 'So walk plank, John? You unpopular prime minister start fourth century. Why invite punishment? Unfairly not, drawing blame life's unpleasantnesses, let alone cock-ups.' 'Are sure?' prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load . . . let put - economy, course . . . I mean, wimpy guy me. But I'm giving that, . . .' On went. Then I rang John Smith. I told I impressed interview Andrew Marr The Independent Thursday, sharpened promise introduce meaty political reforms (if ever gets elected), including referendum proportional representation. I said: 'You starting raise game, John. Many people agreed assertion democracy Britain decaying, Tories must roasted arrogance, incompetence, complacency sharp practices - especially 'centralisation power elimination opposition'. But critics still accuse you, John, laziness ineffectualness. What say that?' 'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted Labour leader. 'Gie o'wit an' sense life, behint kist lie an' sklent.

Likewise political constitutional reform, Michael, L - - d, tho' I beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake leg, lang's I dow]' After that, I thought telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader Liberal Democrats, solicit views Christchurch. But I raise energy. Last year biography Mrs Norma Major - or, old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed Majors' favourite film Being There. I entirely concur choice. In case see marvellous film, this, essence, plot: man one knows anything about, gardener called Chauncey, rises trace become, end film, serious candidate US presidency. Chauncey, played Peter Sellers, utters mundane sentiments halting monotone convinces Republican party's power brokers sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems hear want believe. He deadly innocence. No wonder Majors liked film. John Major must, level, appreciated similarity own, strangely intangible, rise Chauncey's. If see similarity, still revealing. Do protest urban John Major could identify gardener. In interview Farmers Weekly, days ago, Major disclosed unknown fact: father farmer. Farmers Weekly, see, asked Major 'such obvious empathy agriculture'. (Well, obvious Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father farmer. He lived small farm somewhere Shropshire.' Francis Wheen The Guardian, keen student Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, claimed Major's father farmed Bromsgrove 1910. As Wheen pointed out, Major unresponsive 33 years old time, - minor point - Bromsgrove Shropshire. This, course, mean Major made everything up. Family folklore peculiar thing. Yet I heard this, mind immediately went back incident months ago, Major visited Pittsburgh, centre US steel industry, part American tour. I recall made great hit recounting father steelworker city. A farmer Farmers Weekly, Pittsburgh steelworker American audience . . . pattern emerges. Major's father, therefore extension John Major himself, things people. If John Major different sort politician, would point barely worth making. But seem piece Major's approach wider political issues. On one hand appeal pro-Europeans party claiming want Britain heart Europe. On free insulting references European Commission, whenever necessary appeal audience Euro-sceptics. There argue merely means Major typical democratic politician, one wants become prime minister democracy must recognise many constituencies interest, one. But true Major's recent Conservative predecessors. Margaret Thatcher notoriously dogmatic, public, Edward Heath, though always pretended 'consensus politician'. No, Major's technique much invention, much reflection particular character, product unsettled family background. His father, Tom Major-Ball, itinerant figure, moving place place, trying hand number occupations, including circus. No wonder young John Major learned skill fitting prevailing circumstances, matter fluctuating. The problem old one: cannot fool people time. Except movies. Dominic Lawson editor The Spectator ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone winning general election. His honeymoon, personal victory, short-lived begins second year hard-won term deeply unpopular leader everything still prove. The 12 months hijacked internal party differences Europe, debacle surrounding UK withdrawal exchange rates mechanism European Monetary System, continuing, deep recession disappointed alienated many traditional Tory supporters business. Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday outbreak political point-scoring government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends last year easy,' also claimed much achieved. The government's efforts secure framework long-term prosperity beginning pay off. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, joined 10 frontbench colleagues launching counter-attack, involving detailed documented indictment Mr Major's failures. He attacked Tories building 'a bonfire pre-election commitments'. Tory allegiances business world also put immense pressure, though criticism policy drift inaction may soften recession ends. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president Confederation British Industry, remained cautious volunteered: 'If I betting man I would say embryo recovery.' Mr Major take little comfort conclusion, widespread industrialists, greatest achievement year Britain's withdrawal ERM - something resisted which, end, control. Most industrialists, however, find hard criticise Mr Major individual, many drawing flattering parallel personal qualities predecessor. He still attracts gratitude election victory, seen - subsequent problems economy - best result business. But, previous No 10 occupant, seen weak leader, little vision bereft clearly articulated political conviction. There general perception that, important though Britain's future place Europe is, prime minister excessively preoccupied community affairs associated internal party ructions, detriment domestic economy.

One editorial claims some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major, and there is speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher when she resigned under pressure in November 1990. After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift.

In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015 the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats.

The winner revealed October 15 (four days 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) Cheltenham Festival Literature. Like today's Booker Prize, publishing gimmick; Everyman, backing spoof award, significant publisher classic Victorian novels. But retrospective Booker also fascinating exercise historical reconstruction. It raises questions relationship literature society changed 100 years. First, similarities. A good yarn good yarn. Of 1894 books, Trilby tale tone-deaf model sings angel mesmerised sinister hypnotist Svengali, croaks crow dies one concerts. The Prisoner Zenda tells Englishman impersonating King Ruritania rescuing demons. On 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef Sri Lankan servant boy mysterious master, Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge Angels re-enacts wolf-child legend. All books lists gripping stories. The lists share key themes. Both, instance, books colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, set First World War German East Africa. Both provoke similar ways. The controversial books 1894 Trilby, louche vie boheme milieu, Esther Waters, 17-year-old girl seduced, impregnated offered services professional baby killer fiver. It seen Moore's best work, 1894 problems finding publisher powerful circulating libraries refused take it. A century on, relationship fiction sexual morality remains vexed. Last week, Times critic complained inclusion Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel homosexual love, The Folding Star, Booker list, offended Judaeo-Christian ethics. But Hollinghurst wins Booker, novel become succes de scandale Esther Waters Trilby, became bestselling novel 19th century. For great difference 1894 Booker Prize needed sell fiction. Today, accept gap literary writing, Hollinghurst's, popular bestsellers writers Jeffrey Archer Barbara Cartland. This gap Booker tries bridge giving high-level publicity works would normally reach mass audience. The trick works - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback copies. Before short-list announced sold 10,600. The Victorians, contrast, lovers contemporary fiction. Novels accounted 20 cent published books, distinction made high low art. In mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 Little Dorrit, equivalent nearly Pounds 400,000 today. Between 1861 1894, population UK half today literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copies. All 1894 Booker writers popular names; also serious, skilful writers whose books reread pleasure 100 years later. Why fiction much closer public heart 1894? Social, cultural psychological reasons play part. Socially, 1890s reading public vastly homogenous group today: small number middle class authors wrote middle class audience time literate belong elite. The idea two-tier, down-market, fiction irrelevant. Culturally, writers readers certain place mainstream, novel political intellectual forum. Today longer share Victorian confidence novel key genre age. Modernism overturning traditional form Joyce Woolf weakened 20th-century belief novel encouraged divergence highbrow lowbrow. The dominance film television made novels marginal form perhaps longer attract creative talents. George du Maurier originally offered outline Trilby Henry James, thought would write better novel. Today du Maurier would sold Hollywood BBC. The fantasy element fiction, identify characters know them, answered 19th century novel; 20th century TV soaps. Just tabloid newspapers feature characters EastEnders, Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop running serial widespread press speculation whether Little Nell would die, readers wrote begging saved. Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - characterises today's soaps clear features novel 1894. Both In Year Jubilee Esther Waters, example, centre burning 1890s debate marriage, feminism 'New Woman', also tearjerkers everyone enjoyed. The 1894 books compelling prefigure times set back them. Trilby tale hypnotism unconscious decade away Freud; The Ebb Tide paved way Conrad's Heart Darkness first questioning colonial oppression. It unlikely 1994 Booker choices speak eloquently new trends today. Whereas 1894 titles contemporary settings, many 1994 books historical (such Paradise) driven nostalgia (such Beside Ocean Time). Which book win October 15? Stevenson get sympathy vote died 1894 Samoa, setting The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book get retrospective vote, best-known today fashionable mythic overtones lost paradise Mowgli's jungle; position list may also rescue schmaltzy Disney associations confirm serious novel young man's self-discovery. My vote goes Trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - anti-Semitic portrait Svengali - sometimes sloppy, story demonic possession haunts imagination fairy tale long better-written works faded memory. Like Rebecca, popular novel du Maurier's granddaughter, natural equivalent current Booker Prize seeks create: combination classic bestseller.

It known two years earlier, Hitler ordered German pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled cornered neutral port Montevideo, Uruguay, attacked British ships. Hitler apparently wanted keep British learning secrets Graf Spee's construction weapons. In 1941 battle, Bismarck's main guns quickly knocked attacking British ships range secondary guns, Ballard said, helpless taking hundreds hits  sinking clearly inevitable.

When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking muddy seabed dozens objects  Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls, candlestick, chalice Greek Orthodox church, said. The ship obviously crammed loot Chios.

But, tragic sinking Estonia loss 800 lives demonstrates, go toll human life high. As ferries increase size, numbers board risk mechanical failure crew error go up. The move roll-on roll-off ferries vehicle decks run entire length vessel increased risk that, sea penetrates hold bow doors gash ship's side, lead vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) members, ship-owning nations, devoted much thought two decades ship safety. But sinking Estonia lead new review ferry safety. Particularly worrying eyewitness reports suggest water penetrated bow doors manner reminiscent sinking Herald Free Enterprise 1987. Unlike Herald, Estonia appears doors closed, ro-ros undoubtedly vulnerable water penetration. Any review ferry safety focus three main issues. First subject ferry design reconsidered. Additional stability could provided addition sponsons, stabilising bulges project ship's side water line. Greater resistance influx water could obtained installing moveable barriers bulkheads break large car decks. These proposals looked British government wake sinking Herald Free Enterprise. It calculated would cost Pounds 70m Pounds 85m improve standards 57 vessels UK ferry fleet, Pounds 22m extra annual running costs. Higher costs would inevitably lead higher fares - unwelcome ferry operators when, short cross-Channel routes, face competition Channel tunnel. But difficulty pushing fare rises would nothing damaging ferry companies another disaster. Second, IMO national governments must look closely improve enforcement existing regulations. The IMO trying move enforcement agenda, depends good professionalism governments shipowners. Third, IMO given support national governments campaign, launched yesterday, improve crew training. Much regulation recent years concentrated improving ship equipment. Above all, new regulation turn necessary, must introduced speedily. As things stand, take years changes ratified enough governments give force. The European Union, Sweden Finland getting ready join, could take lead speeding process. Ship safety not, course, issue ferry sector. Five (small) ferries lost last year, according Lloyd's Register. But figure pales insignificance compared 96 general cargo ships 12 tankers also went down. When cargo vessel third-world crew goes distant ocean, little attention paid. If loss relatively modern passenger vessel European waters make shipping safety higher priority governments public, small compensation loss life Estonia.

The Iranian President appealed for international aid from all countries except Israel and South Africa. Countries around the world, both friendly and hostile to Iran's Islamic government, responded quickly. The aid from the United States, including funds and supplies raised by Iranians in California , was channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This was a rare example of U.S.-Iranian cooperation after the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Countries as diverse as Egypt, China, India, Malaysia and the Soviet Union sent help. Even Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born author of ""Satanic Verses,"" condemned to death by the Iranian ayatollahs, contributed $8,600. All was not sweetness and light, however.

Iran has said it would welcome such supplies. An opposition group as accused the Iranian government underestimating the number of casualties and of devoting all of its resources to a war with Iran rather than providing adequate housing.

The Soviet leader told meeting Communist Party leadership inter-ethnic relations worsening regions country, due part active resistance put perestroika corrupt groups. Perestroika, restructuring, Gorbachev's program widespread economic social change. State-run media also indicated Friday crackdown begun people Armenia continue agitate annexation mostly Armenian enclave neighboring republic Azerbaijan. The six-month conflict two republics control Nagorno-Karabakh district led mass rallies, strikes ethnic violence February. The Supreme Soviet Presidium, government's top executive body, intervened July 18. It rejected change Nagorno-Karabakh's status called measures develop region's economy culture. The conflict Nagorno-Karabakh one rancorous domestic disputes faced Gorbachev became Communist Party chief March 1985. He indicated Friday wants defuse tensions ethnic groups, also punish transform tensions political crisis. Gorbachev spoke plenary meeting Central Committee, party's policy-making body. A summary remarks distributed official Tass news agency. Gorbachev outlined reasons current aggravation tensions ethnic groups regions Soviet Union, Tass said.

The international community starting look conflict former Yugoslavia, becoming increasingly aware true magnitude seriousness ethnic political conflicts former Soviet Union. The problem indeed pressing one. The disputes Transcaucasus, central Asia, elsewhere former Soviet Union causing great suffering involved. They source legitimate concern Russians, worried clashes close borders. They concerned safety ethnic Russians living countries conflicts, economic social consequences refugees fleeing Russia (whose potential number estimated 2m). They believe problems former Soviet republics either ignored misunderstood. The Russians fear nothing, conflicts worsen probably spread. They argue legitimate concern trying resolve conflicts threaten security. They ask why, international community engaged peacemaking peacekeeping many world's trouble spots, similar efforts undertaken hot spots them. Equally, disputes legitimate concern Britain, western partners whole international community, humanitarian reasons flashpoints risk provoking regional instability. If uncontrolled, pose variety threats European security, including increased traffic drugs arms well international terrorism. Crises Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations west: unless carefully handled, risk prejudicing emerging relationship us. The west sometimes suspicious Moscow's attitude. There differences need resolve conflicts: differences go it. The British government underwrite Russian involvement unless sure peacekeeping troops turn occupying forces. Nor countries secured independence Soviet Union dissolved keen west concede Moscow role played Soviet empire. They fear would compromise sovereignty. When willing Russian troops play peacekeeping role, want form international monitoring. This meant that, though west lacks resources engage directly trouble spots, wary appearing endorse Russian involvement instead, case imperial tendencies. If fashion joint approach Russia western partners problem peacekeeping former Soviet Union, must address concerns. Clearly Russia important role play area. If Russians want international recognition active support international community, west turn needs guarantees Russia regard recognition involvement giving carte blanche former Soviet Union. Peace-keeping former Soviet Union, indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply internationally recognised principles. It needs looked case case basis. Respect sovereignty newly independent countries must remain paramount. We agreed principles underlying Russian, CIS international peacekeeping operations would need include: strict respect sovereignty countries involved; invitation government concerned consent parties conflict; commitment parallel political peace process; clear mandate setting role peacekeeping forces (which whenever possible multinational character); exit strategy peacekeeping forces deployed. These principles help stimulate dialogue political settlement parties conflict, focus attention and, possible, resources settlement conflicts former Soviet Union. All help enhance Russian peacekeeping practices. Although Conference Security Co-operation Europe UN lack resources put large numbers peacekeepers ground themselves, may able suggest measures enhance transparency monitor peace process. Extending co-operation North Atlantic Co-operation Council, also co-operation Russia Nato, might help improve training Russian peacekeepers. This area shall need explore further. We also need put much emphasis preventive diplomacy. One ways help prevent conflicts strengthen democratic institutions newly independent countries former Soviet Union. The CSCE international institutions play important role here, drawing newly independent countries active dialogue ways promoting democratic values principles. We discussed ways strengthening CSCE's role, including role High Commissioner National Minorities, recent Rome ministerial meeting. We must try find ways managing resolving tensions erupt conflict. It easy, must try. Potentially explosive cocktails ethnic political animosities could spread fire intolerance easily countries regions. We need deal together spirit partnership. And need deal urgently. Our security indivisible must ensure vigorous imaginative efforts aimed promoting peace well rights all.

Experts said Thursday greenhouse effect  warming Earth's atmosphere  brought needed attention changes global climate, though directly related drought. Many 13 climatologists meterologists symposium agreed Earth's temperature warming, debated whether short- long-term phenomenon impact Earth. However, Alan Hecht, director National Climate Program Washington, D.C., said uncertainty means policymakers begin deal possible effects, especially undertaking policies make sense right. Mankind must reduce reliance fossil fuels, said, becoming energy efficient, replanting forests investigating alternative energy supplies. Scientists warned recent years Earth's atmosphere gaining carbon dioxide gases, trap heat cause overall temperature rise. Besides fossil fuels, depletion forests South America blamed increase carbon dioxide methane. Some warned higher temperature change character many countries, example drying U.S. Midwest melting polar ice caps.

Sixty-three percent of TV viewers watched the lopsided game which also featured the conclusion of the ""Bud Bowl II,"" a $7 million Anheuser Bush ad campaign. Though the game can spotlight a community's problems, it also has tremendous economic impact. Communities such as Los Angeles--Orange County, therefore, offer incentives, such as rent-free stadium use, to lure the game to their city. Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

No cause for the accident was reported.","Overloading is a major contributor to ferry and passenger boat accidents, particularly in the third world.  Ferries in India, Guatemala, Egypt, China and Bangladesh all carried far more passengers than authorized when they sank.  Captain error also contributed to accidents.  In Guatemala, a ferry captain was charges with negligent homicide when his boat which was being towed, sank after he failed to steer it.   A ferry sank off the Egyptian coast after inexplicably leaving standard navigational channels and ramming a coral reef in stormy seas.  In that accident, survivors claimed that crewmembers abandoned ship without helping them.  The ship's engineer denied the charges.  Two boats carrying Somali refugees sank off the coast of Kenya, resulting in more than 140 deaths, although the cause of the sinking was not reported. An overcrowded ferry in Bangladesh sank with almost double the passengers it was authorized.  In a separate ferry incident in Bangladesh, pirates robbed passengers and threw six overboard. In the Indian accident, monsoon rains may have contributed as well as overcrowding.  Even an advanced country such as Israel can experience ferry accidents.  Nineteen U.S. sailors died when an Israeli ferry sank while returning the sailors to the USS Saratoga.  No cause was reported."

Most best-selling pop biographers play safe: They choose celeb respectable, say pristine, reputation, proceed blacken it, preferably recounting vaguely sourced tales sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealings, even, cases, dyslexia. The resulting portrait dissipated ogre can't spell duly presented hardback form public, turn shocked disgusted forces buy biography millions. A can't-miss formula, surely. Albert Goldman's previous victim genre Elvis Presley. Now Mr. Presley was, forgive expression, fat target writer Mr. Goldman's methods. His title notwithstanding, ""King Rock 'n' Roll"" truth creature old show biz, star whose wholesome image, carefully created P.R. wizards, ripe debunking. But choosing Mr. Lennon next target, Mr. Goldman appears trying debunk undebunkable. For apart puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic thousands interviews gave squalid history: His voracious drug use, perfidy employees, unquenchable sexual promiscuity on. By accounting, then, Mr. Lennon dethrone Ward Cleaver all-American dad. His public loved spite -- perhaps all. Mr. Lennon grew celebrity time transgressions intemperance adultery (quaint terms!) losing social sting. His candor -- that's was, simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything. And grounds insufficient candor resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot debunk, attacks subject. The leitmotif Mr. Lennon's confessions worst days him, Yoko Ono last learned prize virtues quietude domesticity. Now Mr. Goldman announce: He tell half it. Hence 718-page stew unrelieved sordidness, percolating ""scoops"" widely publicized People magazine, ""West 57th"" scholarly venues: Mr. Lennon thing young boys; marriage Ms. Ono pocked faithlessness rancor characterized first marriage; sweet tooth quit. The squalid revelations dribble chemical leak, sliming every page. Remarkably, then, sleazemonger's art triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon worse John Lennon's John Lennon. A great deal muck manages splash Ms. Ono, Mr. Goldman portrays cynical manipulator whose major talent lay exploiting Mr. Lennon craving fame wealth. Mr. Goldman, alas, allows pass unremarked obvious irony rather fine thumbnail sketch well. The keepers Lennon flame course quick point out. Ms. Ono son taken path preferred offended celebrities, hit talk shows display wounds. And Rolling Stone magazine, long house organ Lennon publicity machine, recently published extensive rebuttal book, undercut tone priggish indignation bordering comic. Criticizing ""The Lives John Lennon"" insufficient respect fallen Beatle's legacy rather point -- condemning Charles Manson bad table manners. The book may indeed inaccurate, critics charged. But one hope quibbles veracity obscure countless reasons hate Mr. Goldman's book. There is, starters, sloppy, pompous prose, suggestive grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman sort writer refers pop songs ""pieces,"" though concerti. There knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- drugs, sex, music -- gives license second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. And awkward organization, minor events assume large proportions simple reason reflect badly Mr. Lennon, major events skipped lightly -- goes advance! -- might reveal Mr. Lennon flattering light. All indicates ""The Lives John Lennon"" wretched book: makes good man look bad, shows purpose make man -- whether good man bad one, laymen probably never know -- look bad.

He also noted industry's aggregate net worth policyholders' surplus, currently $125 billion, also plentiful. Generally, insurers book $3 premiums every $1 surplus. Right now, premiums total $200 billion, said. An official Nationwide Insurance noted company $1 surplus every $2 insurance writes. Insurers also buy protection reinsurance paying another company portion premium bear losses.

The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,

With numbers mind, car maker become sponsor three marathons -- New York, Boston Los Angeles -- well running races. Marathons corporate backing time. But Los Angeles ahead pack making distance running commercial spectacle. The city invented corporate-sponsored Olympics created marathon -- artfully dressed Olympic-type amateur race, built ground make money closely held company controls -- well city. ""I took air made event,"" says William Burke, founder president Los Angeles Marathon Inc. For man whose running days ended high school track team, Mr. Burke turning lot heads world marathoning. Last year, first time out, Los Angeles race attracted nearly 11,000 runners -- four times number forecast enough make third -- largest race U.S. The event also pulled $4 million cash services sponsors, leaving organizers $370,000 red ink. This year, Mr. Burke partner, Marie Patrick, expect gross $5 million cash services break even. Next year, say, profit possible. More 18,000 runners expected year. An audience perhaps million half line route, drawn part advertisements 75 million Coca-Cola cans 2,500 billboards Los Angeles area. Marketing experts say festive atmosphere big crowds streets makes marathons attractive sponsors. For cost 30-second ad Super Bowl, company sponsor marathon ""take city,"" says Lesa Ukman, editor Special Events Reports, Chicago-based newsletter. The Los Angeles organizers sponsors perhaps done counterparts elsewhere publicize event. Los Angelenos seeing plugs race millions grocery bags, milk cartons loaves bread, addition soda cans, billboards sources. The venerable New York Marathon taking note. The New York Road Runners Club, organizer race, stopped promoting event years ago runners wanted. Now, Fred Lebow, group's president, says encouraging sponsors promote race Los Angeles sponsors do. The promotion Los Angeles unabashed. ""We tell people they're looking new way crack Los Angeles market, it,"" says Mr. Burke. The pitch attracted likes Coca-Cola Bottling Co.

And Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portraying race civic celebration, thrives volunteers. Some 7,500 people work free monitor course race day. And two-thirds race's office staff work pay. ""I buy this,"" Mr. Burke says, gesturing crowded race headquarters. Not everyone works free. Big-name runners, instance, want paid lot. And here, organizers pinched pennies. While runners paid appear, year's field, last year's, lacks superstars race Boston, New York London. Grete Waitz, one best woman marathoners, wanted $100,000 appear Los Angeles; turned down. Mr. Burke says Australian runner Rob de Castella made known agent run marathons spring but, $25,000, he'd happy say Los Angeles event tempting. Mr. Burke says slammed phone. ""We spend extraordinary amounts money single runner detriment runners,"" says. Mr. de Castella's agent denies story entirely. What Los Angeles lacks superstars, plans make numbers. This year's race may challenge New York London largest marathon ever run. Some 20,500 started New York race last year. Mr. Lebow, organizer New York event, says next year's Los Angeles Marathon surpass number. For one sponsor, may mixed blessing.

She went grin relentlessly $5 million worth commercial endorsements -- surely Olympic record itself. But 1988 Summer Games ended Sunday night, so, too, chance American athletes follow footsteps. Ad agency executives, spend every fourth year glued TV sets, hoping pick next star hawk clients' products, say Olympiad dud. ""I suspect go dullest history Olympics,"" says Jerry Della Femina, chairman ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS. ""This first Olympics passion, passion testimonials. Without heroes, anyone anyone wants emulate."" On surface, Games seemed offer drama makes lucrative endorsement contracts. Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking head springboard, coming back win two gold medals? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, two-inch fingernails raking air 100-meter sprint? But two, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, women's heptathalon long jump, may find difficult previous years turn gold medals gold bank. The fact is, say many marketers, Olympic gold lost much commercial luster. ""I think big money used be,"" says Michael Goldberg National Media Group Inc., New York sports-marketing firm represents Ms. Retton. ""It used kind knee-jerk reaction ad campaign Olympic athlete. It happen anymore."" Certainly, year's winning Olympians trouble securing contracts specialized sports-equipment outfitters speaking invitations obscure trade groups. But major, high-paying endorsements -- soft-drink companies fast-food outlets -- seem surfacing, least yet. Earlier year, sports marketers estimated gold medal Summer Games could earn personable athlete $1 million endorsements. Now, marketers say, medalists lucky pull $100,000 $500,000 year. Advertisers reel litany reasons Olympics igniting much spark. For one thing, suffer comparison 1984 Summer Games, exciting held Los Angeles because, absence boycotting Soviet-bloc countries, Americans 83 gold medals. The 1988 Games, contrast, broadcast halfway world, Soviets trounced Americans, 55 gold medals 36. What's more, marketers say, year's drug scandals cast pall Games, especially incident involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, lost gold medal testing positive steroids. NBC's TV coverage also gets share blame. Marketers say bland skipped frequently one event another little chance excitement build. The constant commercial interruptions, led ratings much lower expected, help, either. During Games, ""there enough continuous TV coverage that, much soap opera, possible get involved lives competition,"" says Leigh Steinberg, attorney ice-skater Brian Boitano, gold medalist 1988 Winter Games. But summer, says. Recent changes Olympic rules, meanwhile, led glut Olympians search endorsement deals. Before 1984 Games, Olympic athletes allowed make commercials unless gave amateur status. Now, appear many ads want, income must go trust fund training expenses. ""Every year, Olympic people wanting commercials -- basically, everybody available,"" says Daisy Sinclair, vice president ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As result, ""aura"" surrounded Olympian, ""the bloom off."" Companies also becoming sophisticated approach celebrity endorsements. Increasingly cost conscious, longer hook Olympian company president likes athlete's sport. And years paying big bucks Olympic stars see fade obscurity, companies finally gotten hint Olympian fame fleeting variety. ""If think phone ring hook (you win) gold medal, going happen anymore,"" says Stephen Disson, senior vice president marketing ProServ Inc., Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies know ""six months heroes sporting events"" consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude Olympics becoming typical. It uses sports stars commercials Pepsi Light Oppenheimer Mutual Funds plans call 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer use athletes public eye regular basis, football basketball players,"" says Charles Miesmer, agency's executive creative director. ""People Michael Jordan 10-plus years sports careers, row, I worry public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And look 1988's winners start showing Wheaties boxes, either. General Mills Inc., featured Ms. Retton decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner Wheaties boxes past, says looks three qualities endorser: career achievement, popular appeal off-the-field accomplishments. A spokeswoman says none year's crop meet three criteria. So far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee visible endorsements. Even Olympics began, made commercials Primatene mist 7-Up. And, according agent, Pearl Hodge World Class Management, ""in process"" signing McDonald's Corp., work behalf efforts aid underprivileged children. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take endorsement lead. Advertisers say good looks fashion flare, attracting interest medal winners. (The sprinter's manager reached comment.) Another Olympian endorsement potential swimmer Matt Biondi, five gold medals. Mr. Biondi already signed swim-wear contract Arena USA Inc., Parkes Brittain, agent Advantage International Inc., says client ""will definitely high-income ring, highest name."" Then Mr. Louganis. Since winning two gold medals 1984 Summer Olympics, diver little luck major endorsements. And marketing executives say second sweep diving events may potential. ""When advertisers looking male hero, word 'macho' trails closely,"" says Marty Blackman Blackman & Raber, sports-marketing firm New York. ""I find Louganis macho guy."" Still, marketing professionals say Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery smashing head secured diver's future. His manager, Jim Babbitt, comment contract offers. He say, however, client ""done fine. He unhappy. He dives perform; dive dollars."" ---Winning EndorsementsThere one former Olympian top sports endorsers last year.ATHLETE: Arnold Palmer (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Hertz, PaineWebber, Pennzoil, United Airlines, GTE, Toro, Loft Seed Co., Sears, Pro Group, Robert Bruce, Westin HotelsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $8 millionATHLETE: Jack Nicklaus (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Bostonian Shoe Co., Hart Schaffner & Marx, Optique Du Monde, Pine Hosiery Mills, WarnacoESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Boris Becker (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Coca-Cola, Deutsche Bank, Polaroid, UNICEFESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Greg Norman (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Reebok, Spalding, Epson Computers, Hertz, Qantas Airlines, Daikyo Group, Swan Lager & Castlemaine, Akubia HatsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4.5 millionATHLETE: Michael Jordan (Basketball, 1984 Olympian)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Nike, Wilson, Excelsior, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Johnson Products, Ohio ArtESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4 millionATHLETE: Ivan Lendl (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Gleneagles Country Club, Avis, Seiko, Adidas, Bow Brand StringsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: John Madden (Former football coach)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Ace Hardware, Miller Lite, Ramada, Exxon, Canon, GreyhoundESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: Jim McMahon (Football)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Taco Bell, Kraft Foods, Ebel Watches, Honda, Adidas, LJN Toys, Revo SunglassesESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: Dennis Conner (Yachting)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Rayban, Sperry Topsider, Wrigley's, Disney, Lacoste, Pepsi-ColaESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Chris Evert (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Lipton Iced Tea, Wilson Converse, Ellesse, Polo Club Boca Raton, Rolex, Evert Active Life Skin Care, Marchon Sunwear EllesseESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Martina Navratilova (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Lufthansa Airlines, Vuarnet, DHL, Sugar-Free Jello, Aspen Club, RKO Video, World Tennis MagazineESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Jackie Stewart (Retired race car driver)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Ford, Goodyear, USF&G, Rolex, Gleneagles, American Express, British Telecom, ICCIESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionSource: Sports Marketing NewsletterDebi Thomas' dream Olympic goldturned disappointment Saturday East Germany's Katarina Wittwon second straight Olympic championship Canadian ElizabethManley took home silver crowd cheering countrymen.It's over.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing groupof runners in those events.In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured manysuccessful Olympic athletes.",,,,

New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related Hugo reduce pretax earnings $35 million $45 million. Analysts said AIG told must cover first $35 million losses reinsurance agreements cover bulk remaining damages. AIG insured property Puerto Rico, eastern Caribbean Islands coastal regions Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based St. Paul, Minn, said pretax cost Hugo exceed $50 million. That amount takes consideration St. Paul expects recover reinsurance contracts, company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. expected disclose Hugo's likely impact earnings sometime today.

That would wipe 35% 40% $1.40-a-share earnings estimate third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments Hugo exceed $400 million South Carolina alone, far surpassing company's record payout single disaster. When damages North Carolina Virginia added, company said, payments exceed $500 million. It said three times previous record $165 million set Hurricane Alicia, hit Houston-Galveston, Texas, area 1983.The greenhouse effect may breed bigger anddeadlier hurricanes future, storms 50 percent strongerthan Hugo last year's record-setting Gilbert, somemeteorologists say.Hugo blasted eastern Caribbean Carolinas 135 mphwinds week, killing least 41 people.Just Hugo struck U.S. coast, pressure measuredat 940 millibars. That made 12 strongest hurricanesthis century hit United States, National HurricaneCenter's Miles Lawrence said today.Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore Caribbean lastyear, killing 300 causing $2 billion damage. It mostpowerful hurricane ever recorded.Gilbert seems upper limit hurricane withcurrent ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel meteorologydepartment Massachusetts Institute Technology.But seas warm up, say 3 6 degrees Fahrenheit, thewind speeds might 25 percent higher  means destructiveforce would 50 percent higher, said.Stephen Schneider, deputy director National Center forAtmospheric Research Denver, said research suggests thewarming trend already here.Schneider, expert greenhouse effect author newbook Global Warming, said six 10 hottest years thelast 100 occurred 1980s.He projects 1990s hotter.Hugo demonstrated effect warm Atlantic waters itswinds jumped 105 mph 135 mph passed GulfStream hitting East Coast, Schneider said.You'll get worse hurricanes Caribbean warmer, hesaid.

Satellites, computers, and reconnaissance planes helped forecasters monitor Hugo's progress. Insurance claims broke records. The greenhouse effect could raise future storms' destructive power by 50%.","Category 4 Hurricane Hugo did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean on Sep 17, 1989, and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo. Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.",Hurricane Hugo Could Have Been Deadlier. Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.",,,,

It quickly overran the Kuwaiti capital and then continued on to southern oil facilities.  The United States led the United Nations in condemning this action and imposing tough economic and military sanctions.","Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions by exceeding OPEC production quotas thus driving down oil prices.  He further accused Kuwait of ""stealing"" Iraqi oil from a common oil field on their border.  He then invaded Kuwait, claiming to do so at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  The United States led the western world and the United Nations in calling the coup a sham, denouncing this invasion and imposing strong economic and military sanctions on Iraq in an attempt to get them to withdraw.  Oil prices surged while Saddam warned against foreign intervention.  The U.S. dispatched warships to the area.","It appeared that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his countries financial problems and territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  Iraq emerged from its 1980-1988 war with Iran with a debt of approximately $80 billion.  Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions in oil revenues by exceeding OPEC assigned oil quotas, thus driving down the price of oil.  He further accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from an oil field common to their border and also of conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq economically and militarily.  Breaking off perfunctory negotiations with Kuwait, Iraq invaded, claiming it responded to a request for help from Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  Iraq quickly overwhelmed a mismatched Kuwaiti military, captured the capital and continued south to the oil facilities.  The United States called the coup a farce.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador asked the United States to intervene militarily.  U.S. President George Bush called for an ""immediate and unconditional"" withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  Although not willing to publicly discuss military options, Bush said all U.S. options remained open.  His administration led a United Nations embargo of Iraqi exports, including oil, and Iraqi imports.  Iraq retaliated by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait.",Saddam Hussein Defied United States and United Nations,"On August 2, 1990, after Saddam Hussein had charged Kuwait with unfriendly acts, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic moves by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq remained defiant and moved troops toward the Saudi Arabian border. As of August 6, 1990 the situation was ominous.","In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border. The two countries agreed to talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives walked out. The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of them to Iraq. As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.","On July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPECproduction quotas and of stealing oil from wells along the countries'disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a""short-notice exercise"" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would notbe intimidated by U.S. pressure. Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwaitagreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq hadmassed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. The next day Iraq pulledout of the talks and on August 2,1990 invaded and quickly occupied allof Kuwait. President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blockedmost Iraqi imports. The U.N. Security Council denounced the invasionand demanded Iraq's withdrawal. The Pentagon stepped up air patrolsand movement of warships into the Persian Gulf. When, on August 6, theU.S.  pushed strong sanctions against Iraq through the U.N. SecurityCouncil, Iraq struck back, rounding up several hundred Britons,Americans, and West Germans in Kuwait, taking some of them toIraq. Iraqi troop concentrations menaced the Saudi Arabian border andthe U.S. warned Iraq of vital American interests in Saudi Arabia, butas of August 6, 1990 it was a stand-off. Iraq was in possession ofKuwait and oil prices soared on the international market.",,,,

42,d075b,"The expensive practice using ballooncatheters force open heart arteries immediately heartattacks, routinely done many large hospitals, unnecessaryand abandoned, according major study released Tuesday.The study found heart attack victims quickly receiveclot-dissolving drugs, need extra step thecommon balloon procedure, known angioplasty.Some experts said results good news, meanthat heart attack patients treated communityhospitals, angioplasty available.The study also important financial message. Its authorsestimated angioplasty widely adopted heartattacks, could raise nation's annual medical bills $704million.This trial settled one important questions inmodern-day cardiology, commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy theUniversity Washington, Seattle.The study phase 2 Thrombolysis Miocardial InfarctionTrial, TIMI-II, directed Dr. Eugene Braunwald Brigham andWomen's Hospital Boston.The first phase study showed giving people aclot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, TPA,immediately heart attacks dramatically improved chancesof survival.The latest study, presented annual meeting AmericanHeart Association, intended see whether people betterstill doctors tried clear away remaining blockages aftergiving TPA.At 50 hospitals United States, doctors randomlyassigned 1,636 patients get angioplasty two days theirheart attacks tests showed chance mightbenefit. Sixty percent actually underwent procedure,which temporarily inflates balloons dangerously narrowed heartarteries squeeze open.A comparison group 1,626 also got TPA. But notconsidered angioplasty unless lingering heart pain orabnormal exercise tests recovery.After 42 days, 11 percent angioplasty group haddied suffered heart attacks, 10 percent thosein comparison group.A year treatment, difference survival.About 93 percent groups still alive.There appear additional benefit fromangioplasty, Braunwald said.Dr. Thomas J. Ryan Boston University Medical Center commented,We answer trial important question ofhealth care delivery.While small hospitals give clot-dissolving drugs heartattack patients, sophisticated labswhere angioplasty performed.If study found immediate angioplasty improvessurvival, would meant many angioplasty labs wouldneed established doctors trained give theprocedure.The watch word watchful waiting see patients needangioplasty. This ultimately makes possible patients betreated community hospitals transfered terciary carecenters angioplasty needed, said Dr. Howard Morgan,immediate president heart association.Heart attacks occur clot blocks artery feeds theheart muscle. The purpose TPA similar drugs dissolvethese clots muscle dies. To effective, drugs mustbe given four hours start heart attacksymptoms.Experts say 20 percent heart attack victimsare considered candidates drugs. Many people delaygoing hospital permanent damage occurs. In others, thetreatment may considered dangerous recent surgeryor history strokes.Balloon angioplasty also widely used treat people withclogged heart arteries suffered heart attacks. Thelatest study question usefulness kind ofangioplasty.Deaths heart blood vesseldisease dropped 24 percent decade, remains byfar nation's biggest killer, taking life every 32 seconds, theAmerican Heart Association said Sunday.The good news continue see improvement thedeath rate biggest killer population, said Dr.Bernadine Healy Cleveland Clinic Foundation, presidentof heart association.Those trends dramatic seem reversing, shesaid. The bad news heart disease still killing almost 1million Americans year, we've got long way go.The association released statistics annual forum forscience writers.Experts attribute decline death rates combination ofhealthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes better food,and improved medical treatment.The public ought appreciate progress madein heart disease 20 years, said Dr. Myron L.Weisfeldt Johns Hopkins University. It's almost unbelievable.There almost form heart disease can't approachwithout meaningful treatment.However, Weisfeldt, president-elect heartassociation, also cautioned much work remains, inimproving care encouraging people take better care theirhealth.I believe prevent least 50 percent ischemicheart disease United States year 2000 stopsmoking, get cholesterol treated 220, identify andtreat hypertension, said.Ischemic heart disease clogging blood vessels feedthe heart. It underlies heart attacks, single lethalheart ailment.Association figures indicated 1986  recent yearfor statistics  estimated 978,500 Americans diedfrom heart attacks, strokes diseases heart andblood vessels. Cancer, No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.Between 1976 1986, death rate forms ofcardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It declined 28 percent forheart attacks 40 percent strokes.The association's figures show one fourAmericans suffers form cardiovascular disease, almosthalf eventually die it.About 60 percent heart attack deaths occur thevictim reaches hospital. Studies show half allheart attack victims wait two hours getting anemergency room.Weisfeldt said major health goal getting people go thehospital three four hours first sign heartattacks. During period, still time give drugsto dissolve blood clots causing heart attacks.This treatment lives reduce disability heartattacks.Other major goals, said, include finding ways improve theeffectiveness angioplasty, technique uses balloons openclogged heart arteries, finding surgical medical techniquesto identify protect people risk cardiac arrest.The heart association estimates cardiovascular disease willcost $88.2 billion year medical expenses lost wages.Among statistics released association:The common cardiovascular disease high blood pressure,which affects 60 million Americans.About 200,000 deaths cardiovascular disease eachyear occur people age 65.There 1,418 heart transplants 1987, almost nine times asmany 1983.About 2.5 million Americans angina, chest painresulting clogged heart arteries. About 300,000 new cases occurannually.As many 1.5 million Americans heart attacks thisyear.A drug eases heart's workload cancut risk new cardiac attacks death 20 percent inpeople recovering heart attacks, according major studyreleased Thursday.The study, conducted Denmark, found drug Verapamil,known calcium channel blocker, effective 1{ yearsafter heart attack. Calcium blockers several classes ofmedicines commonly prescribed relieve high blood pressure.This first trial indicates calcium blockermay beneficial acute myocardial infarction, heartattack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine University Florida.Several studies calcium blockers, including one largeU.S. study published last year, failed find benefit fromusing medicines heart attacks.According Danish study, Verapamil effectiveas another variety blood pressure medicines known betablockers protecting people heart attacks.While calcium blockers may replace beta blockers heartattacks, researchers said drugs still rolein treatment.We feel important alternatives. Many patients donot tolerate beta blockers, said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard ofCentral County Hospital Hillerod, Denmark, co-author thestudy.Beta blockers generally recommended people withasthma emphysema. This means drugs cannot given tocigarette smokers, frequent victims heart attacks.In study, conducted 20 community hospitals, doctorscompared 897 patients got Verapamil heart attacks with878 people took placebos.After 18 months followup, 146 deaths recurringheart attacks Verapamil patients, compared 180 inpeople got dummy medication.We wanted see effect would observed withVerapamil, said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen Copenhagen MunicipalHospital.If effect, seen first 12 18months, big increase mortality myocardialinfarction period, said. Then levels off. That'swhat demonstrated. It worked.The researchers believe reducing amount workneeded heart sustain circulation, calcium blockerslowered chances ischemia, episodes heart's ownmuscle deprived oxygen.They said unsure earlier studies failed showany benefit calcium blockers heart attacks. However,they noted studies enrolled patients also takingbeta blockers. And might obscured benefits fromcalcium blockers.The results presented meeting American Collegeof Cardiology. Among research described meeting:Dr. James H. Chesebro Mayo Clinic said five-year studyfound aspirin stop continued buildup existingblockages arteries feeding heart, although maymodestly protect development new deposits. However,like studies, one found aspirin signficantly cutthe risk heart attacks.Dr. Eugene Braunwald Harvard Medical School said nextphase large study clot-dissolving drugs see whateffect unstable angina. This condition whichpeople suffer spontaneous chest pain triggered workor stress. Until now, drugs used treat heartattacks.An intestinal operation lower cholesterolof heart attack patients reduced risk another heartattack death heart disease, researchers said today.The surgery, called partial ileal bypass, one significantdrawback: It causes chronic diarrhea persists years.In operation, doctors change route smallintestine one-third bypassed. This reduces theamount cholesterol absorbed bloodstream.The $52 million, 17-year study conducted people hadalready suffered heart attacks. The approach lengthened livesof people mild heart attacks moresevere heart damage.During average 10 years follow up, death rate amongsurgery patients sustained minimal heart damage 24percent. In comparison group intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percent.Dr. Henry Buchwald University Minnesota, directedthe study, said surgery considered withcholesterol-lowering drugs possible standard treatment.It role management patients highcholesterol heart attack, Buchwald said. It iseminently logical extend cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, patients high cholesterol hada heart attack.Besides diarrhea, undergo surgery somewhatmore prone kidney stones, gallstones intestinalobstructions.The study conducted Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia Little Rock, Ark., published today's NewEngland Journal Medicine.Despite wide acceptance cholesterol lowering, doubts remainabout whether actually helps people live longer alreadyhave healthy hearts. Although latest study conductedexclusively people suffered heart attacks, Buchwald saidhe believes research settle question.It offers strongest justification marked lipid(cholesterol) ineervention ever offered, Buchwaldsaid. It powerful study should, certainpeople never satisfied, end cholesterolcontroversy.In study, 421 people recovered heart attacksunderwent surgery, comparison group 417 people weretreated diet alone. At start study, averagecholesterol levels 251. The surgery lowered people'scholesterol 23 percent.The overall risk dying heart disease sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack reduced 35 percent thesurgical patients healthiest hearts. The surgical patientsalso required less half many coronary bypass operationsbecause clogged heart arteries.New treatments stop heart attack itstracks may help victims get hospital quicklythan ever before, perhaps three days attacks, astudy published today concludes.Doctors University Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effects sending carefully selected heart patients homeearly. They found people unusual complications,got back work sooner substantially lower medical bills.It extraordinarily safe strategy, said Dr. Eric J.Topol, study's director. There problems anyserious events.Topol said early discharges made possible two recentmedical advances  tissue plasminogen activator, TPA, andangioplasty.When given quickly heart attack, TPA dissolve clotsin heart's arteries minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar results opening clogged arteries withtiny balloons.The report represents latest steady three-decade trendof sending heart attack patients home hospital evershorter stays.However, study New England Journal Medicine saidmore research needed findings widely adopted.In 1950s, doctors recommended patients stay inbed one two months heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffered uncomplicated heart attack in1955, spent seven weeks recovering hospital.However, doctors learned long inactivity harm thangood. Patients got shape, developed blood clots becamedemoralized.In 1960s, stay shortened three weeks the1970s two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalized seven 10 days.In paper, doctors determined 80 507 heartattack patients studied healthy enough considered forearly discharge. None irregular heart beats, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill tests showed signs heart attackdamage.Forty patients sent home three days, reststayed seven 10 days. After six months followup, none haddied, number medical problems groups similar.However, people early discharge group able returnto work two weeks sooner others, medicalbills significantly lower  $12,546 $17,868.The researchers estimated 15 percent heart attackpatients discharged three days, annual saving wouldbe least $280 million.In accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, deputyeditor journal, cautioned study largeenough spot complications might result reducinghospital stays.This single study, wrote, sufficient justifysweeping changes current management practices patientswho may first appear uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors cautious prescribing aspirin preventer heart attacks research supports value, Food Drug Administration said. Taking aspirin prevent heart attacks may increase people's chances dying things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, agency said commentary today's Journal American Medical Association. The FDA persuaded aspirin makers March refrain promoting aspirin preventer first heart attacks, least now. A study published January indicated aspirin every day reduced risk nonfatal, first heart attacks 47% 11,000 male doctors five years, compared 11,000 took non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tends promote bleeding reducing ability blood platelets help form clots. Heart attacks occur clots form arteries nourishing heart choke blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risks people already clotting problems, high blood pressure, puts increased risk hemorrhagic strokes, FDA commentary said. Strokes result brain damage caused bleeding brain blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes caused bleeding. The FDA commentary pointed 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded 11,000 subjects taking aspirin recent study, compared two strokes 11,000 subjects taking substitute. Overall death rates two groups same, though aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate much lower. There 104 nonfatal heart attacks aspirin users 189 comparison group. ""Physicians, will, time, forced make professional judgments aspirin use basis incomplete information,"" said FDA commentary, co-written agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree completely,"" said Dr. Julie Buring, Harvard University researcher participated aspirin study. She added telephone interview yesterday extension study way, researchers expect report FDA late fall. The commentary noted British study, also released January, 5,000 male physicians found aspirin failed protect heart attacks, associated 2 1/2-fold increase disabling strokes.A drug used treat patients complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks infour five heart patients, according study published intoday's edition New England Journal Medicine.Surprisingly, however, study found drug, diltiazem,increases chance subsequent heart attack patients whosehearts pump abnormally, experts said.Even so, results may trigger increase use thedrug, primarily used treat angina, doctors said.The drug tested 38 hospitals United States andCanada patients recently suffered heart attack, saidDr. Arthur Moss, clinical professor medicine Universityof Rochester principal investigator study.The results suggest drug may quite effective indecreasing likelihood second heart attack majorityof patients, Moss said. But study also surprisingly suggeststhat patients suffer pulmonary congestion givendiltiazem drug increases chance subsequentheart attack.We know prescribe drug to,Moss said. That's study about.Diltiazem calcium entry blocker, newest class drugsto introduced fight heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blockers types commonly prescribed doctors.The study involved 2,466 heart attack patients, giveneither 240 milligrams diltiazem day placebo. Patientswere recruited 1983 1986 followed 12 52 months.Overall, drug decreased additional heart attacks 11percent, statistically significant, Moss said.But patients normal near-normal heart pumpfunction  1,909 patients 80 percent total group diltiazem decreased chance another heart attack 25percent, Moss said.In patients whose hearts pumping problems, drug onlydidn't help, increased chance heart attack 25percent.Dr. John Schroeder, cardiologist professor StanfordUniversity, said surprised drug increased thechance heart attack group overall results werenot higher.But bottom line first study showthat diltiazem effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean patients routinely put drug ona long-term basis.Dr. George Beller, cardiologist professor theUniversity Virginia, said also somewhat surprised aboutthe increase heart attacks group suffering pulmonarycongestion.This one first reports seems identifythat, said.Diltiazem two calcium entry blockers introducedin decade, Beller said, research effectivethey various applications early stages.Nitrates used 50 years, betablockers developed 1960s.Aspirin sales jumped 41 percent weeksearlier year, rash headaches.A study 22,000 male doctors shown taking asingle aspirin every day could cut heart attack risk half.The study one series recent reports showing thefirst time doctors able treat heart attacks also prevent them.In recent report, doctors found one aspirin tabletand single dose clot-dissolving drug given 24 hourscan dramatically cut risk second fatal heart attack.Without treatment, patients 13 percent chance dyingfrom second heart attack five weeks, researchersfound. With treatment, figure dropped 8 percent.The real discovery treatment patients going toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, says Richard Peto ofOxford University, one study's authors.Heart disease nation's leading cause death, far.The National Center Health Statistics reports 762,820Americans died heart disease 1987.To put another way: Of 2,127,000 American died thatyear, one three died heart disease. (This notinclude died blood-vessel diseases, strokes.)The drugs responsible recent success preventingheart attacks new clot-dissolvers old standby,aspirin.The usual cause heart attacks blockage coronaryarteries, supply heart muscle oxygen-rich blood. Theblockage arises buildup fats, cholesterol clottedblood.Clot-dissolvers break clots, thus restoring blood flow.Aspirin interferes aspects clotting process, helping toprevent clot formation first place.The limited sales clot-dissolving drugs UnitedStates show many doctors still using them, despitetheir proven success. But beginning change.Some doctors predict not-too-distant future thesedrugs judged safe administeredroutinely paramedics ambulances suspected heart attackvictims reach hospital.We know respond quickly, havethe courage use drugs absence definitivediagnosis, says Dr. Burton Sobel Washington University St.Louis, pioneer testing clot-dissolvers.The important thing teach patients inadvance value early treatment, says.While public attention focused new ability toprevent heart attacks, researchers also made importantprogress speeding recovery patients survive heartattacks.Researchers University Michigan recently determinedthat heart attack victims released hospital assoon three days heart attacks. Most heart attacksvictims kept hospital least seven 10 days.The patients given early discharge able return worktwo weeks sooner study group. After six months,not one death recorded early-discharge group. Theresearchers concluded perhaps 15 percent heart attacksvictims could safely discharged three days.In July, Stanford University doctors found workers wentback jobs seven weeks heart attacks didat least well workers went back typicalconvalescence 10 11 weeks.All advances come time public health expertsare increasingly emphasizing role good health goodnutrition lowering heart disease risk.Early next year, American Heart Association seal approvalwill begin appearing foods low fat cholesteroland therefore help reduce heart disease risk.U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop July issued firstreport nutrition, calling Americans lower theirconsumption fats eat vegetables, fruits, fish,poultry whole grains.The report likened first Surgeon Generals reporton smoking, issued 1964, focused public attention onsmoking's hazards. Koop's recommendations largely echo theAmerican Heart Association, help carry messageto many people.Progress research heart disease making clear theheart attack longer mysterious killer strikes withoutwarning cannot defended against.Much done prevent heart attacks, great improvementsare made treatments, recovery faster everbefore.The use clot-dissolver aspirin could, alone, save25,000 lives year United States, doctors say.These results, says Dr. Peter Sleight Oxford University,will change medical practice worldwide.A natural substance called transforming growthfactor beta appears able limit damage cardiac cellsfollowing heart attack, according study published thejournal Science.In study Jefferson Medical College Philadelphia, agroup laboratory rats induced heart attacks suffered 50percent less cell damage injections transforming growthfactor beta rats receive TGF beta.TGF beta growth factor opposes bad guysfollowing heart attack, said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, professor atJefferson.Lefer said research team simulated heart attacks 24 ratsby partially blocking key arteries hearts.In 12 rats, researchers injected placebo. In theother 12, injected transforming growth factor beta.For received TGF beta, said Lefer, damagefrom attack much less severe. There 50 percentless injury TGF beta it.The extent heart cell damage determined measuring theamount creatine kinase heart tissue attack.Hearts damaged blood supply interrupted, heartattack, tend lose creatine kinase, said Lefer. Thus, bymeasuring loss substance, researchers coulddetermine amount heart damage.Lefer said TGF beta seems block action othersubstances, tumor necrosis factor, cause bloodvessels narrow heart attack. Narrowed blood vesselscarry less oxygen-rich blood cells causes additionalinjury heart attack.TGF beta normally present heart cells, studypublished Science said missing rat heart cellsdamaged simulated heart attack.Though TGF beta produced naturally body, Lefer saidhis research team used substance produced artificially byGenentech, California biotechnology firm.Lefer said team conducting additional studies withTGF beta experimental treatment human heart attackvictims substance least year away.Jefferson Medical College, study done, part ofThomas Jefferson University Philadelphia.Science, published study, journal theAmerican Association Advancement Science.The experiment also hinted blood urine test,which measures activity blood protein called renin,might suggest new ""risk factor"" heart attacks. Abouthalf 1.5 million Americans suffer heart attackeach year known risk factors heartdisease, high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking,obesity high blood pressure. It unknown whatdistinguishes seemingly healthy people whodon't suffer heart attacks.The blood urine test already done manycommercial laboratories medical conditions thanheart attack risk, said John H. Laragh CardiovascularCenter Cornell University New York Hospital. ""In ourhands, cost $40 labs may cost thepatient $40 $80,"" said. Dr. Laragh pioneered theresearch underlying use test, developed byhis wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey. The test, isn'tpatented, available kit form laboratories.The blood portion test determines whether thekidneys releasing renin blood stream howactive chemical is. The release renin firststep rapid chemical chain reaction raises bloodpressure. The urine portion test tells much saltis bloodstream. A high concentration salt theblood also raises pressure.The test based fact saltconcentration blood rises, tending boost bloodpressure, activity renin normally drops offsetthe effect salt.The new experiment designed test theory put forthby Dr. Laragh colleagues activity therenin blood foretells possible heart attack. Thetheory provoked sometimes furious controversy almost20 years.The Cornell cardiologist argued many peoplewith high blood pressure activity renin theblood much higher warranted amount saltin blood. Such ""high renin"" people high risk ofa heart attack. On hand, patients withhigh blood pressure, activity renin much lowerthan warranted degree salt blood. These""low renin"" people low risk heart attack, Dr.Laragh maintained.In experiment, blood urine samples obtainedat New York City offices factories 1,717 worke","AP881115-0113,AP890115-0014,AP900322-0112,AP901003-0006,AP880428-0041,WSJ880603-0129,AP880818-0088,AP880829-0222,AP900705-0149,WSJ910418-0105",,,,,New medical advances reduce the number of heart attacks nationwide.,"The chances of having a heart attack, the number one killer in the United States, have decreased significantly in the last decade. Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

At least four deaths and 24 people injured have been recorded since Pinatubo began erupting after six centuries of dormancy. About 84,000 have been evacuated. Heavy rains today have raised fears of catastrophic mudflows.Pinatubo is in the ""Ring of Fire"" that circles the Pacific. Mount Unzen in Japan, also in the ring, recently erupted, killing 38.President Aquino toured refugee centers and authorized the release of $1.42 million for relief efforts. According to Foreign Secretary Manglapus, the eruptions should not effect the stalled talks with the U.S. on new Clark and Subic lease agreements.",,,,

Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories. The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers. In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.  Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting.

The last awards show took a long three plus hours. The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character.

The openings came after long negotiations which, in most cases, sawMcDonald's contracting with local farmers for the beef, potatoes and other suppliesneeded for its restaurants.","McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets. After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.

In Moscow thousands lined up for an opening day record of 30,000 meals being served at 27 cash registers.  Next, McDonald's opened in China, where cooking is a culinary art.  McDonald's worldwide restaurants are joint ventures with locals of the country in which they operate.","""Golden Arches"" continues its worldwide expansion.  In 1988, seven years after its first attempt to bring a restaurant to South Korea, McDonald's successfully joint-ventured with Ahn Hyo Young, a Harvard schooled entrepreneur. McAhn Enterprises Ltd. had to fight government red tape and develop local suppliers in order to open in Seoul.  That year, Big Mac also braved the communist world.  On March 24, 1988, McDonald's successfully opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  Its local competition was the hamburger-like pljeskavica, i.e., ground pork and onion served on bread and eaten by hand.  Two years later, McDonald's had their most successful opening ever, worldwide.  In Pushkin Square, Moscow, thousands of people waited in line for hours at the largest McDonald's in the world for hamburgers, fries and shakes.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.  All European and Jewish issues were addressed.  Reunification occurred.",East's Economy Sagging. Soviets Endorse German Reunification.

Woeful economic conditionsprevailed. Massive demonstrations for democratic reform swept the nation. The hard-lineCommunist government admitted its failure, giving strong impetus to the Germanreunification movement. The Soviets endorsed it in February as the World War II Alliesdid later. Unification was now imminent.The specter of an economically and politically powerful Germany disturbed many, butparticularly the Poles, Soviets and world Jewry. Despite concerns, reunification would beaccepted as a lesser threat than a chaotic East Germany.","Through the first three months of 1989, 80,00 East Germans fled their country, andmassive demonstrations raised doubts that Erich Honeker the, hard-line Communistleader could resist the democratic reforms sweeping his country. Street demonstrationsoccurred throughout East Germany in November 1989, and the East German CommunistParty was forced to admit the its system had failed.The West German constitution called for a united Germany, but it received little attentionuntil late 1989. The specter of a powerful undivided Germany troubled many, butparticularly the Soviets and Poles.Matters moved quickly in early 1990. Soviet President Gorbachev gave West Germanyan unequivocal promise that German reunification would be honored. Two days later, onthe 12th of February, said that negotiations with East Germany should begin as soon aspossible after the 18 March East German elections. In time the World War II Allieswould endorse reunification.With reunification imminent, world Jewish leaders asked for guarantees that theHolocaust would not be repeated.

His National Guard service and campaign gaffes were attacked. He proved a low-profile team player and Bush announced he would be on the 1992 ticket. Quayle's grandfather owned the newspaper in Quayle's hometown of Huntington.

They have three children.","Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, was the surprise choice of Republican George Bush for  presidential running mate in 1988. Quayle was compared to John F. Kennedy because of their similar ages and congressional service, and to Robert Redford in appearance. Quayle was criticized as a novice and his National Guard service attacked. His campaign gaffes made news, but he was loyal to Bush and a team player. After controversies subsided he kept a low profile. A year after the election he agreed to be on ""Meet the Press"", shortly after Bush announced he would be on the ticket in 1992, and was uncontroversial. Quayle grew up in Huntington, Indiana, population 17,000, where his grandfather owned the newspaper. He graduated from DePauw University in 1969, spent six months in National Guard training, then in 1971 investigated consumer problems in the Indiana Attorney General's office and became an aide to the governor. While attending Indiana University Law School he met and married his wife Marilyn. They jointly practiced law in Huntington before Quayle spent 12 years in the US Congress. Quayle has three children and is known as a nice guy with good values. In 1991, Huntington hosted an exhibit in his honor, which he didn't attend because of a busy schedule.","Bush, friends support Quayle despite errors and political inexperience",George Bush's selection of Dan Quayle as his running mate surprised many.Many political observers thought him a lightweight with baggage to carry.Bush continued to voice support for him even though Quayle was given only avery small role in the campaign and was not highly visible as vicepresident.,"George Bush's choice of Dan Quayle as his running mate surprised mostpolitical observers, but was quickly supported by many of Quayle's fellowRepublican senators. Quayle was viewed as a lightweight and questions wereraised about his military service and errors in his official resume. Hismain attributes were party loyalty and identification as a devoted familyman.  Quayle contributed little to the campaign and, after being elected,all but disappeared from the political scene.  President Bush, however,continued to voice support for, and confidence in Quayle.  His friends,especially in his home town, called him a winner.","George Bush's choice of Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate,surprised most political observers.  Despite service in Congress andSenate, he was looked upon as lacking the experience and mettle for avigorous national campaign.  Several Republican senators rallied support.Senator John Warner of Virginia compared Quayle to Thomas Jefferson.Senator Bob Dole in nominating Quayle at the Republican Convention, calledhim a dedicated public servant and devoted family man and cited his supportfor the Reagan program.Devotion to family and friends was a theme voiced by those who had knownQuayle for many years. Relatives and friends believed that if Quayle wereelected, he and his family would remain a strong unit.Questions arose regarding Quayle's fitness for the job, and there were somesuggestions that he should withdraw.  He had called himself a ""Vietnam-eraveteran"" which angered some actual combat veterans.  Quayle's service was in the National Guard, a position he apparently gained through familyinfluence.  Quayle's resume contained a reference to a position held inIndiana, two years before it was created.Quayle survived these criticisms but did not play a strong role in thecampaign or as vice president.  Friends, especially those in his hometown,remained loyal.",,,,

The removal of this symbol of the Cold War was part of an elaborate ceremony attended by the top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies. Appropriate to the occasion, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze backed away from all-out opposition to united Germany's membership in NATO, suggesting that this could take place but only after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave thecountry.","On June 22, 1990 Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was hoisted by a huge crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum. The guardhouse, constructed after erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was the scene of many successful and unsuccessful attempts at escape from East Berlin and had become a symbol of the Cold War. By June of 1990 with the Berlin Wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, and with top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city after unification, U.S. officials decided it was time to remove the famous landmark. The foreign ministers attended an elaborate ceremony to honor the symbolic act. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze took the occasion to modify the previous Soviet firm opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, proposing that such a step be allowed after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. U.S. Secretary of State Baker declared himself ""underwhelmed"" by the offer, but softening of the Soviet position was a welcome sign appropriate to the occasion.",The Cold War ends as Checkpoint Charlie is lifted into history.,"As a U.S. army band played and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, Checkpoint Charlie, the symbol of the Cold War, was lifted into history today. Its removal came after East Germany overthrew its communist government and opened the border between the two Germanys.","Checkpoint Charlie was lifted into history today during a ceremony including the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies. Secretary of State Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie as a symbol of the Cold War, hoped its removal would bury the conflicts it created. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for a removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city. Checkpoint Charlie became superfluous when the East Germany overthrew its communist-controlled government and the border between East and West Germany was opened. Although the ceremony was closed to the public, residents of the street watched from their windows.","Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous symbol of the Cold War was lifted into history today. At an invitation only ceremony attended by the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies, a U.S. army band played an old Berlin song as the checkpoint was hoisted onto a waiting flatbed truck, to be taken to a museum. Speaking at the ceremony, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for the removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city and the withdrawal of troops six months after the two German states unify. Secretary of State James Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol, expressed the hope that its removal would bury the conflicts it created. The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous. Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany. Among the invited guests was West Germany's Chancellor Willy Brandt who was mayor of Berlin in the 1960s.",,,,
