0,d116i,"Five astronauts boarded Discovery today second try sending Hubble Space Telescope orbit scan outermost reaches universe clues beginning time. Astronomers are starting tingle again anticipation what Hubble will be able accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head NASA science activities. Air Force forecasters said there was 90 percent chance weather would be favorable launching shuttle scheduled time 8:31 a.m. EDT. More half million gallons liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped space ship's fuel tanks midnight. The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed crew cabin just dawn was breaking Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers new set eyes and ears that we don't have, said William Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program. It's going change our perspective altogether. I can't say what we're going learn, I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new things. Discovery was aiming altitude 380 miles, highest shuttle has ever gone, so telescope can be placed its proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, which journeys space next month Astro observatory, sat launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery, only second time pads have been occupied; first was 1986 just Challenger explosion. Hubble has been waiting take its place space 1983, delayed technical problems and Challenger accident. The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes liftoff because faulty power unit shuttle. The mood Kennedy Space Center was considerably less festive first launch attempt, when hundreds astronomers gathered their families. The day launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescope space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if problem develops. Discovery will follow Hubble 40 miles away two days its lens cap is opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Hubble is not expected start providing scientific data satellite month or more liftoff. However, NASA said it will release its first image  open star cluster constellation Carina  week launch. In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million has been spent spare parts, astronaut training and computer software operate instrument. The European Space Agency contributed $250 million 15 percent viewing time. NASA estimates it will cost $200 million year operate and maintain telescope space. During its 15-year working lifetime, telescope will provide astronomers 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity ground-based observatories. As result, they will be able study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling Earth 14 billion years. Astronomers hope learn whether universe was created 15 billion years ago believed and uncover some mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also is expected shed light how and when universe might end. The telescope is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered 1920s that universe is expanding. His work gave rise Big Bang theory that universe was created tremendous explosion. In addition Hubble, Discovery carries human skull filled sensors measure space radiation that astronauts receive. It is skull's third trip space. The shuttle is end its five-day mission landing Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday second attempt launch shuttle NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery is scheduled lift 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. We feel very confident that things are going go well this time, said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're going come out OK Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep trying we do. That's kind name game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that countdown was proceeding smoothly and shuttle appeared be perfect condition. The countdown got way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit forced first launch attempt be scrubbed four minutes liftoff April 10. The unit was replaced new one, which tests showed be fine. Hopefully, we'll get shuttle pad this time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance favorable weather was expected launch time, low clouds being main concern, said Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front north was expected pass area Monday night. The outlook is considerably better Wednesday and Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronauts arrived Johnson Space Center Houston early Sunday afternoon, shuttle Columbia was being transported launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery. It is only second time shuttle launch pads Kennedy Space Center have been occupied simultaneously. The first time was January 1986; 16 days Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand said he does not believe National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast his shuttle. NASA expects launch Columbia astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier May 16, one week later planned because Discovery's two-week delay. In some cases, it could be problem having shuttles launch pads, Brand said. In this particular case, everything's fitting together. NASA has Saturday get Discovery ground. After that, all launch attempts must be halted eight days so Hubble's batteries can be recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble time it is disconnected Discovery's electrical system its two energy-collecting solar panels take space. Discovery's payload bay was sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing risk contamination telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery will aim altitude 380 miles, highest shuttle has ever gone, so telescope can be placed its proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey space, astronomers expect look back nearly beginning time and solve some universe's most perplexing mysteries. Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected Hubble and thus provide additional targets telescope. The $100 million observatory also will focus Columbia's nine-day mission Comet Austin, believed be its first trip solar system. Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled launch 1986, were delayed Challenger accident. The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened its self-induced sleep today it was still use its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were hold, unable begin any observations. We are out `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, supervisor engineers controlling telescope. He said telescope was running normal control-all mode, where its computers and sensors guide where it is pointing. Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear return Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations Earth and talked ground-based reporters their flight. Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat widespread public awareness telescope, which is expected eventually look back 14 billion light years  nearly birth universe. It's hard go somewhere and find someone who has never heard Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want learn how add and subtract and study science. The telescope's big eye has remained open, Hubble had been safe mode all motion stopped because earlier problems linking high-speed dish antennas relay satellite. The antennas are primary links relaying scientific data ground. Terry said that safe mode, one tape recorders telescope reads telemetry signals all its systems and that these would be played Earth and analyzed when antennas are working properly. We expect use that data investigate what happened, he said. Engineers are able send commands telescope its secondary antennas communications system is not useful scientific data, which must be transmitted high rate speed. We're putting scientific instruments hold mode, effect standby mode, he said. Shortly 6 a.m. EDT, controllers Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md., completed series commands that took telescope out its safe mode and then began run 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health. It will take another day $1.5 billion telescope is operating way it was supposed this point startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're backing very deliberate and slow and careful approach these problems, Olivier said Friday. This is not time do anything dumb. The telescope problems have put flight center several days behind, five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking their schedule. Landing is scheduled 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., flight controllers were keeping close watch weather. Winds were predicted be 20 mph gusts 29 mph. Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph touchdown. The shuttle carries enough supplies stay orbit three days Sunday if necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awakened crew members 1:30 a.m. EDT today playing song, Cosmos. Thanks wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate today, said Commander Loren Shriver. The song was selected honor Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronauts were finish their experiments and photography today and pack trip home. They also planned hold news conference space reporters Johnson Space Center. Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were run series tests make certain shuttle's computers and control jets were ready return Earth. The crew deployed Hubble Wednesday they had stayed close telescope case there was trouble opening aperture door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared perform space walk today crank it open orbit 380 miles Earth. But that proved unnecessary when door was opened Friday morning, exposing telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye starlight first time. Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when door opened, engineers later got them back line. The gyroscopes were knocked out motion and that, too, kept telescope safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director orbital verifications Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set conservative limits first operations and that caused many malfunctions. There also were two communications outages totaling several hours. Hubble is designed safe modes so it can be master its destiny case contact orbiting communications system is lost extended periods, Terry said. NASA had planned release its first test image telescope Tuesday, showing open star cluster constellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed because antenna problems. Scientific data will follow month or two. The telescope, named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers its 15-year working lifetime look back 14 billion years and possibly determine age universe. The universe is believed have been created 15 billion years ago cosmic explosion. Hubble provided basis big-bang theory creation. He discovered 1920s that universe is expanding and that farther galaxy is Earth, faster it is moving away. After years delay and last-minute snag, Hubble Space Telescope was freed shuttle Discovery Wednesday and, glinting sunlight, drifted orbit its 15-year search new worlds. Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble end shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm delay getting one telescope's solar wings unfurled. The first NASA's great observatories is now station 330 nautical miles Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really looked great we flew away it, and we sure hope it does good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later. The $1.5 billion telescope was released 3:38 p.m. EDT shuttle entered its 20th orbit Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later planned. The shuttle then backed away. Thank you very much ride, said Mike Harrington, director orbital verifications Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been shuttle's airlock, ready walk inspace free solar panel. That proved be unnecessary. Close no cigar, better Hubble that it went way it did, Sullivan said. She and McCandless had trained nearly five years make such rescue mission. The first solar array unreeled its mast midday Wednesday shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, South America's eastern coast. It started providing power telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours charge. Deployment starboard panel, however, was more troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latches were first released, then moved fifth its 39-foot length, and stopped again. A third attempt rolled panel out all way. Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley began long process releasing Hubble shortly 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted 12{-ton telescope high shuttle. Hubble was taken shuttle electrical power just it was lifted out cargo bay and was operating its nickel-hydrogen batteries. At one day, seven minutes flight Discovery, Hubble is now its internal power, Carr said. The game has begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking. Worries that telescope's instruments would be starved electricity eased first solar panel was stretched out. Television cameras Discovery showed first array it was pulled its reel slowly steadily, sun reflecting gold-colored panel and silvery telescope. Discovery was 380 statute miles Earth, 70 miles higher any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated need put telescope Earth's distorting atmosphere. Discovery's five astronauts were awed view. I'd pass quote day on-board astronomer something effect that big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said Hawley. Astronomers have waited seven years Hubble take its place space. The telescope originally was scheduled launch 1983, technical problems and Challenger explosion pushed it back. The mission was delayed another two weeks when faulty power unit Discovery forced National Aeronautics and Space Administration halt first launch attempt four minutes April 10's scheduled liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted space, transporting Hubble out this world and search others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is be opened Friday, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Discovery was Hubble case door does not open properly. If problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again walk space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said telescope would be tested Thursday its ability maneuever aperture door is opened. We want be full control so we don't ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, he said. The telescope cannot focus sun because sensitivity its five instruments. If all goes well, crew will land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects release its first image telescope  open star cluster constellation Carina  Tuesday. Data will follow month or two. Astronomers hope look back almost beginning time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling Earth 14 billion years. They expect determine precisely how and when universe was formed, currently estimated 15 billion years ago. The telescope is named late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered 1920s that universe was expanding. He also was responsible helping form Big Bang theory creation. Ground controllers Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today two main antennas $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope trying more six hours lock on. Applause erupted Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md., glitch that marred Hubble's first full day space was solved. We have confirmation that we have achieved communication Tracking and Data Relay Satellite high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers had said all they believed antennas were working all right and that problem was incorrectly pointing either satellite or TDRS, orbiting communications satellite that acts switchboard. In successful attempt, they nearly doubled width antennas' beams take more territory, sweep 6.2 degrees 10.8 degrees. The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information much slower rate and can be used emergencies, were working well. Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available remedy certain problems. The outage was not problem which space walkers would have been summoned. The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures storms Texas their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiments. Steve Terry, director team calibrating various aspects telescope, said first outage was caused human error and was not serious problem. It began 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes hour, he said. The second failure occurred 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted send signal telescope's two high-gain antennas TDRS. This time it was pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, Goddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing it was cause. The telescope, embarking 15-year search new worlds, was released shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awakened crew early today loud rendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite. Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake that song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are lot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday and Hubble had good night while you were asleep. We appreciate good words everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away telescope and put shuttle series maneuvers, last one completed this morning, park Discovery orbit 46 miles Hubble. The telescope really looked great we flew away it, and we sure hope it does good work, Shriver said Wednesday. Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks all great work you've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud you. Scientists have hailed Hubble  NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft  greatest advance astronomy Galileo raised small telescope his eyes nearly 400 years ago. Discovery and its five astronauts will follow telescope while controllers Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such responding directional commands. The next milestone is Friday, when telescope's 10-foot aperture door is be opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Then Tuesday, NASA expects release first image telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina. Data will follow month or two. If aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return telescope so two astronauts could perform spacewalk fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said telescope would be tested today its ability maneuver aperture door is opened. We want be full control so we don't ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, he said. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitive instruments. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used shuttle's 50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope and hoist it cargo bay. One telescope's solar arrays unreeled its mast expected and started providing power telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours charge. But there was trouble second panel. It wouldn't budge when latches were released, and then moved fifth its 39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all way out third attempt. By final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were their space suits airlock, 30 minutes away taking tools hand and going outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik said cause problem is unknown. The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles Earth, 70 miles higher any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated need put Hubble Earth's distorting atmosphere. Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost beginning time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years reach Earth. They hope determine how and when universe was formed, currently estimated 15 billion years ago. The telescope originally was scheduled launch 1983 was delayed technical problems and Challenger accident. Discovery, which blasted orbit Tuesday, is scheduled land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven years late, Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out this world and search so distant that they may have been formed beginning time. Less five hours it rode space shuttle Discovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal. At sign life, applause and cheers erupted Mission Control Houston. As we can tell, everything looks perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesday will be drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space. Discovery, trailing arc white smoke brilliant blue sky, carried silver-colored telescope orbit 380 miles Earth  higher 70 miles any previous shuttle. There Hubble will stay search yet-unseen wonders creation instruments that can look 14 billion years backward time. Our window universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted Discovery rose its seaside launch pad. It's beautiful day have Hubble Space Telescope orbit instead here Earth it's been so many years, said NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's its element and I'm delighted. The telescope was supposed be launched 1983, technical problems and Challenger accident delayed its deployment. It suffered further delay two weeks ago when countdown was stopped four-minutes-to-go point because faulty hydraulic unit shuttle. While it remained Earth, telescope cost $7 million month exercise and keep readiness. In its first day space, that checkout and testing continued remotely control Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland. On hand watch Discovery launching was contingent scientists who have hailed Hubble greatest advance astronomy Galileo raised small telescope his eyes nearly 400 years ago. Truly referred early-day astronomer when he was asked long delays getting telescope its working station. Somebody other day said, `Who remembers day that Galileo picked his telescope look stars?' said Truly, former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right. The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet diameter, size railroad tank car. When it flies free, it will receive electrical power its six scientific instruments two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward each side. It is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that universe was expanding and that farther away galaxy is, faster it is traveling. That gave support theory that massive explosion  Big Bang  created universe 10 20 billion years ago. The Hubble is expected help provide answer two major questions: How old is universe? How big is it? The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches diameter, other 12 inches. Two instruments are cameras, two are spectrometers and one is photometer. In addition, fine pointing system acts sixth instrument providing precise measurement distances. On Wednesday, Hawley is grapple 12{-ton telescope shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out cargo bay, point it, and  long checkout  drop it overboard orbit its own. In cargo bay, telescope receives electrical power shuttle. But juice is cut when instrument is lifted out and it will depend internal batteries solar panels are extended receive light sun. Should solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed space suits, ready go open cargo bay unfurl arrays manually. Discovery's launch was not its problems. With 31 seconds left countdown, computer that runs final moments liftoff refused close fuel valve and stopped launch process. The problem was overcome and shuttle lifted 8:34 a.m. EDT, three minutes late. The shuttle is scheduled land Sunday 9:49 a.m. EDT Edwards Air Force Base California. On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, shuttle's windshield was splattered several flecks things. He said windshield was streaked debris and that it also was smeared when spent booster rockets fell climb orbit. The astronauts also had problems their UHF radio circuit, and one ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative. Neither problem was considered serious. The shuttle that put Hubble Space Telescope orbit also carries instrument used 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble: eyepiece what once was world's most powerful telescope. It's great pleasure have something such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday she circled Earth space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried orbit Sullivan. After she brings eyepiece back Earth, it will be placed display observatory. It's basically symbolic gesture astronomy future astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group runs observatory, located San Gabriel Mountains Los Angeles. The discoveries made Hubble 100-inch telescope Mount Wilson gave us giant leap forward our understanding universe, McAfee said. We believe Hubble Space Telescope will do same thing. The Hooker Telescope was world's most powerful telescope its construction 1918 1948, when 200-inch Hale Telescope was placed operation Mount Palomar Observatory northeast San Diego. Using Hooker Telescope, Hubble was first determine distance galaxy Milky Way, institute said statement. This crucial discovery provided first definite proof that other galaxies existed far confines our local galaxy, institute said. During 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and assistant used Hooker telescope take thousands photographs faint galaxies, showing that most them were moving away each other very quickly. This provided observational evidence concept, suggested Einstein's Theory Relativity, that universe is expanding, institute said. Hubble's work helped convince scientists universe was created giant explosion, called big bang, estimated 15 billion years ago. The Hooker Telescope was mothballed 1985 Carnegie Institution, former operator observatory, money-saving move. The institute hopes obtain funds reopen it.","AP900424-0048,AP900422-0032,LA042590-0152,AP900428-0050,LA042290-0160,AP900425-0198,AP900426-0135,AP900424-0096,LA042590-0135,AP900428-0022",The shuttle Discovery triumphantly launches the Hubble Space Telescope.,"Two weeks after an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery roared from Cape Canaveral into orbit 380 statute miles above earth.

1,d113h,"INDIA suffered fresh wave terror last night when explosion destroyed two blocks flats centre city Calcutta, killing least 45 people and injuring scores others. Police said bomb exploded crowded trade and residential district Bowbazaar shortly midnight, causing two blocks flats collapse and trapping 70 people rubble. The identity bombers was unknown explosion comes just five days 250 people were killed and least 1,200 injured series bomb attacks aimed heart Indian business capital Bombay. A militant Sikh group fighting independence Indian state Punjab has claimed responsibility Bombay blasts, police are unconvinced, saying they were carried out foreign group connivance 'local criminals'. In what many interpreted reference Pakistan, whom India has fought three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, federal home (interior) minister, told parliament New Delhi that he suspected 'an international conspiracy.' Most estimated 125 people living Calcutta flats were their beds when blast occurred, setting fire buildings, according officials city's central control room. At least 45 people were dead arrival hospital, they said. Last Friday series car bombs exploded Bombay what government described systematic attack India's commercial heart. Among targets were Bombay Stock Exchange, landmark Air India building, shopping complex, and two hotels airport. The attacks Calcutta and Bombay are severe setback attempts heal wounds created recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India. More 2,000 people died riots, including 700 Bombay, razing mosque Ayodhya northern India Hindu zealots December 6. Some fear wave bomb attacks is designed stir renewal communal strife and undermine efforts government Mr P V Narasimha Rao open economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. Last night national and local state leaders appealed calm attempt prevent renewed outbreak violence. Mr Rao urged nation ignore rumours 'inhuman and criminal blast'. A ROW has erupted Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and Securities and Exchange Board India, securities watchdog, board's recent first-ever inspection stockbrokers' books. The Sebi has accused stockbrokers flouting exchange's rules, including regulations margin trading designed limit risk members defaulting excessive speculative investments. It has also accused exchange authorities failing enforce rules and poor administration. The stock exchange denied allegations, saying they were 'baseless, made out context and blown out proportion.' The argument will do nothing restore investors' faith stock market where, measured Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares have fallen 48 cent their peak early last year, including 320 points fall government's budget was announced two weeks ago. Yesterday index closed 2330. Foreign investors, who are being wooed India source much-needed capital, will also be concerned latest allegations poor management exchange. In one its most damaging passages, inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas, leading firm headed Mr Hemendra Kothari, former BSE president, and Mr Jaswant Chotalal, member BSE's governing body, avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 4.08m). Mr Kothari said yesterday that most transactions covered report were off-exchange deals directly financial institutions which margin payments were not required. Mr M R Mayya, BSE's executive director, said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions. Sebi also accused exchange mismanaging administration its building. This week's argument is only latest series disputes which began almost soon Sebi started operations year ago. It was established Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, crucial element financial reform. Brokers claim Sebi is heavy-handed and fails understand their needs. They say rules must be applied flexibly and many firms are extremely small and unable carry cost extra regulations. But finance minister is backing Sebi hilt and singled it out praise his recent budget speech. Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and dodge taxes and also contributed last year's securities market scandal which banks, including UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost combined gross total Rs40bn. The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured. The market reopened Monday attempt return normal. It has had compromise - trading has been restricted hour day, and dealing has moved back traditional ring, where it stopped year ago. Dealers seemed this, BSE index rising 5.6 cent Monday and Tuesday. But another bomb blast Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday, and index came back 50.62, or 2.1 cent, 2,409.23. All this has taken place volatile background: Bombay equity market, six weeks or so, has had contend first unusually bullish speculation, national budget February 27, and subsequently some savage expressions disappointment. Dr Manmohan Singh, Indian finance minister, disappointed traders budget end last month. He postponed corporate tax reforms year, denying hopes tax cut recommended expert group. He reduce excise and import duties broad front, left out cement and steel sectors, where share prices had been boosted pre-budget speculation. To top it all, Dr Singh refused equate domestic investors their overseas counterparts taxing short-term capital gains.

THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops Bombay last night more dozen bombs exploded city, killing 200 people and injuring more thousand. The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared be systematic attack India's commercial heart. All exploded 90 minutes afternoon. Among targets were Bombay Stock Exchange, landmark Air India building, shopping complex, and two hotels airport.

One targets was close headquarters Shiv Sena, Hindu nationalist party accused fomenting violence riots, which most victims were Moslems. National and local state leaders appealed calm attempt prevent renewed outbreak violence. Mr Rao urged nation ignore rumours 'inhuman and criminal bomb blasts'. Mr Sharad Pawar, former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister Maharashtra state, said all roads Bombay had been blocked and army put alert. He said: 'It is aimed disrupting economy and it appears conscious effort because only Bombay seems be target.' Mr Shankarrao Chavan, federal home (interior) minister, told parliament New Delhi: 'We suspect international conspiracy.' The Indian High Commission London said attacks were 'part externally supported terrorism which has targeted India some time'. However, Indian officials stopped short directly accusing Pakistan, country's arch-enemy. The bomb attacks were spread throughout city and were clearly aimed city's better-off business people - contrast riots which victims were mainly poor.

They sensed there was enormous difference riots which scarred city December and again January. Those were caused traditional mix crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred destruction mosque Ayodhya. The weapons used were mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles. Friday's outrage, contrast, bears deadly stamp high-technology terrorism, complete Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money. The only comparable previous incident was assassination 1991 Mr Rajiv Gandhi, former prime minister, Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists. But that was single bomb aimed one man - explosions Bombay were designed terrorise nation's commercial capital. Bombay accounts 35 cent India's exports. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, described blasts attack India's economy. The immediate assumption highest level and streets Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help. But these suggestions were seen Bombay deliberate attempt deflect attention people who popular mind are real suspects - Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge riots which hit India Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 Bombay. If Moslems are found have staged attacks, Indian authorities will certainly suspect that operation was supported Moslem country, notably Pakistan. The implications would be vast. Breaking diplomatic relations would be minimum step Delhi could take dangerous road. Mr Rao chose his words carefully his visit Bombay: 'There is definite possibility that our search may not stop country. I do not want name anybody because it will have ramifications and country.' There is no evidence linking attacks Moslem extremists, let alone Pakistan. Even if Moslem groups are found be responsible bombings, they could have been supplied other Moslem countries. India would still face diplomatic crisis hardly same scale. For moment, such concerns seem remote streets Bombay, where atmosphere yesterday was calm. Workmen were clearing away rubble blast sites, including blackened stock exchange building. Bombayites seemed determined put outrage them. At Gymkhana Club and dozens other sports grounds, hundreds men and boys were playing cricket they do every Sunday. Others were walking seafront arch Gateway India.

2,d120i,"THE revelation that John Major is capable candid, blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record friendly journalists has surprised some people. It has been suggested that recording prime minister's conversation Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, which Major used variety four-, six- and eight-letter words communicate his lack fondness certain colleagues, may do him good. With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction. What piffle. Major is gonner, especially this week's revolt wooden-tops Christchurch by-election, where Conservative majority 23,015 last year's general election was converted 16,427 majority Liberal Democrats. Fifteen months too late, voters Christchurch rounded Tories malignant and squeaky fury. In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting private when speaking public. In public, they have be careful what they say, so their utterances achieve horrible mattness. But private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really is spectacle. To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday John Major and John Smith. Smith, Scot, is leader Labour Party, though not many people know that. In aftermath Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I wanted provoke two Johns spot real soul-searching. To guarantee them privacy, I used signal-scrambler. No one could have eavesdropped. Their responses were true form. But I have left out swear-words because new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the gratuitous use expletives or obscenities is discouraged . . . Four-letter expletives will be confined infrequent use review (Arts) pages.' I can live that, though why artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is puzzle. First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, just one article, FT this week? They were describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements. They not pull their punches. I bet you went chalk-white. 'So why not walk plank, John? You are most unpopular prime minister start fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly or not, you are drawing blame all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone cock-ups.' 'Are you sure?' prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . how it come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load . . . let me put it you - economy, course . . . I mean, wimpy guy me. But I'm not giving that, . . .' On and it went. Then I rang John Smith. I told him I had been impressed his interview Andrew Marr The Independent Thursday, which he sharpened his promise introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever gets elected), including referendum proportional representation. I said: 'You are starting raise your game, John. Many people will have agreed your assertion that democracy Britain is decaying, and that Tories must be roasted their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation power and elimination opposition'. But some your critics still accuse you, John, laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say that?' 'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense life, behint kist lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, clever, sturdy fellow, then he was sae fley'd his showther gae keek, an' tumbl'd wi' wintle. Likewise political and constitutional reform, Michael, L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, lang's I dow]' After that, I thought telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader Liberal Democrats, solicit his views Christchurch. But I couldn't raise energy. Last year biography Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that Majors' favourite film was Being There. I entirely concur their choice. In case you not see that marvellous film, this, essence, was plot: man no one knows anything about, gardener called Chauncey, rises trace become, end film, serious candidate US presidency. Chauncey, played Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments halting monotone this convinces Republican party's power brokers that he is sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems hear what they want believe. He has deadly innocence. No wonder Majors liked this film. John Major must, some level, have appreciated similarity his own, strangely intangible, rise and that Chauncey's. If he not see similarity, that is still more revealing. Do not protest that urban John Major could not identify gardener. In interview Farmers Weekly, few days ago, Major disclosed unknown fact: his father was once farmer. Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy agriculture'. (Well, it was obvious Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father was farmer. He lived small farm somewhere Shropshire.' Francis Wheen The Guardian, keen student Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed Bromsgrove 1910. As Wheen pointed out, Major was unresponsive 33 years old that time, and - minor point this - Bromsgrove is not Shropshire. This, course, does not mean that Major made everything up. Family folklore is peculiar thing. Yet when I heard this, my mind immediately went back incident few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre US steel industry, part his American tour. I recall that he made great hit recounting that his father had been steelworker city. A farmer Farmers Weekly, Pittsburgh steelworker American audience . . . pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore extension John Major himself, can be all things all people. If John Major were different sort politician, this would be point barely worth making. But it does seem all piece Major's approach wider political issues. On one hand he will appeal pro-Europeans his party claiming want Britain be heart Europe. On other he is free insulting references European Commission, whenever it is necessary appeal audience Euro-sceptics. There are those who will argue that this merely means that Major is typical democratic politician, that one who wants become prime minister democracy must recognise many constituencies interest, not just one. But that has not been true Major's most recent Conservative predecessors. Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, public, and so too was Edward Heath, though he always pretended be 'consensus politician'. No, Major's technique is very much his invention, very much reflection his particular character, itself product his unsettled family background. His father, Tom Major-Ball, was itinerant figure, moving place place, trying his hand any number occupations, including circus. No wonder young John Major learned skill fitting prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating. The only problem is old one: you cannot fool all people all time. Except movies. Dominic Lawson is editor The Spectator ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone himself winning general election. His honeymoon, very personal victory, was short-lived and now he begins second year his hard-won term deeply unpopular leader who has everything still prove. The 12 months have been hijacked internal party differences Europe, debacle surrounding UK withdrawal exchange rates mechanism European Monetary System, and continuing, deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory supporters business. Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday outbreak political point-scoring government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends that last year has been easy,' he also claimed that much had been achieved. The government's efforts secure framework long-term prosperity was beginning pay off. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, was joined 10 frontbench colleagues launching counter-attack, involving detailed and documented indictment Mr Major's failures. He attacked Tories building 'a bonfire pre-election commitments'. Tory allegiances business world have also been put immense pressure, though criticism policy drift and inaction may soften recession ends. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president Confederation British Industry, remained cautious volunteered: 'If I were betting man I would say we have embryo recovery.' Mr Major can take little comfort conclusion, widespread industrialists, that his greatest achievement year has been Britain's withdrawal ERM - something which he resisted and which, end, he had no control. Most industrialists, however, find it hard criticise Mr Major individual, many drawing flattering parallel his personal qualities and those his predecessor. He still attracts gratitude election victory, which was seen - subsequent problems economy - best result business. But, previous No 10 occupant, he is seen weak leader, little vision and bereft clearly articulated political conviction. There is general perception that, important though Britain's future place Europe is, prime minister has been excessively preoccupied community affairs and associated internal party ructions, detriment domestic economy. Many industrialists are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting reshape economic strategy favour manufacturing base. But jury is out whether rhetoric will give way effective action.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The first 12 months - election victory initial Maastricht defeat  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- APRIL Wins election 21 seat majority 'The country looked Labour government eye and decided that it was not all Time Change' - Peter Jenkins, late political commentator 'We have won tonight magnificent victory, victory many people thought our grasp' - Major  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAY Best Conservative local election results 13 years England and Wales.

It is very exciting thing become leader Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, follow one most remarkable leaders Conservative Party has ever had, Major said. Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going unite totally and absolutely, and we're going win next general election, said Major, who will be youngest British prime minister this century. Major received 185 votes, two short majority. Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56.

The Conservatives' main rivals, socialist Labor Party, demanded general election. John Major is Thatcherette - that is how he sought election and that is how he got elected, said Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.

After receiving prize, Ishiguro paid tribute Salman Rushdie, 1988 runner-up award, who went hiding February when he was threatened death Moslems who said his novel The Satanic Verses blasphemed their faith. Now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it is inconvenient many people support his writing, I just felt it was fitting that we should not turn our backs him, Ishiguro said.

'Kelman's novel is unlikely come anywhere that,' one bookseller said. Mr Kelman was also shortlisted prize 1989 his novel A Disaffection. It is sensational shortlist: bestseller love and hypnotism, blockbuster battles and brides Ruritania, and pornographic shocker teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it. Out are eminences gris Victorian letters - novels Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make grade. This week shortlist hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced six judges, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In Year Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide. The winner will be revealed October 15 (four days 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) Cheltenham Festival Literature. Like today's Booker Prize, it is publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is backing spoof award, is significant publisher classic Victorian novels. But retrospective Booker is also fascinating exercise historical reconstruction. It raises questions how relationship literature and society has changed 100 years. First, similarities. A good yarn is good yarn. Of 1894 books, Trilby is tale tone-deaf model who sings angel when mesmerised sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croaks crow when he dies one her concerts. The Prisoner Zenda tells Englishman impersonating King Ruritania and rescuing him demons. On 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge Angels re-enacts wolf-child legend. All books lists are gripping stories. The lists share key themes. Both, instance, have books colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which is set First World War German East Africa. Both provoke similar ways. The controversial books 1894 were Trilby, its louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, which 17-year-old girl is seduced, impregnated and offered services professional baby killer fiver. It is now seen Moore's best work, 1894 it had problems finding publisher and powerful circulating libraries refused take it. A century on, relationship fiction and sexual morality remains vexed. Last week, Times critic complained inclusion Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel homosexual love, The Folding Star, Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics. But if Hollinghurst wins Booker, his novel will not become succes de scandale Esther Waters and Trilby, which became bestselling novel 19th century. For great difference then and now is that 1894 Booker Prize was not needed sell fiction. Today, we accept gap literary writing, such Hollinghurst's, and popular bestsellers writers Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland. This is gap Booker tries bridge giving high-level publicity works which would not normally reach mass audience. The trick works - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback copies. Before short-list was announced it sold 10,600. The Victorians, contrast, were lovers contemporary fiction. Novels accounted 20 cent published books, and no distinction was made high and low art. In mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 Little Dorrit, equivalent nearly Pounds 400,000 today. Between 1861 and 1894, when population UK was half that today and literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copies. All 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread pleasure 100 years later. Why was fiction so much closer public heart 1894? Social, cultural and psychological reasons play part. Socially, 1890s reading public was vastly more homogenous group today: small number middle class authors wrote middle class audience time when be literate was belong elite. The idea two-tier, and down-market, fiction was irrelevant. Culturally, these writers and readers were certain their place mainstream, and novel was their political and intellectual forum. Today we no longer share Victorian confidence novel key genre our age. Modernism and overturning traditional form Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief novel and encouraged divergence highbrow and lowbrow. The dominance film and television has made novels more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract most creative talents. George du Maurier originally offered outline Trilby Henry James, who he thought would write better novel. Today du Maurier would have sold it Hollywood or BBC. The fantasy element fiction, which we identify characters if we know them, was answered 19th century novel; 20th century we have TV soaps. Just tabloid newspapers feature characters EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop was running serial there was widespread press speculation whether Little Nell would die, and readers wrote begging her be saved. Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soaps were clear features novel 1894. Both In Year Jubilee and Esther Waters, example, centre burning 1890s debate marriage, feminism and 'New Woman', are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed. The 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our times and are set back them. Trilby is tale hypnotism and unconscious decade away Freud; The Ebb Tide paved way Conrad's Heart Darkness and first questioning colonial oppression. It is unlikely that 1994 Booker choices will speak eloquently new trends today. Whereas 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many 1994 books are historical (such Paradise) or are driven nostalgia (such Beside Ocean Time). Which book will win October 15? Stevenson will get sympathy vote because he died 1894 Samoa, setting The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book will get retrospective vote, because it is best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones lost paradise Mowgli's jungle; its position list may also rescue it schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it serious novel young man's self-discovery. My vote goes Trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - its anti-Semitic portrait Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is story demonic possession and haunts imagination fairy tale long better-written works have faded memory. Like Rebecca, popular novel du Maurier's granddaughter, it is natural equivalent what current Booker Prize seeks create: combination classic and bestseller. The shortlist six Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted question 'Who?' many publishing industry. According one insider, some list 'are B-team writers best'. The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published Chatto and Windus), melancholy study homosexual obsession which was tipped likely candidate initial 'long list' 15, The Reef (Granta) young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed. As other three - Knowledge Angels (Green Bay) philosophical fable children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside Ocean Time (John Murray) 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make grade'. The shortlist Booker, UK's most hyped literary prize and one most lucrative, is all more surprising bumper year new fiction fulfilling criteria - English language and non-American - consideration award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems astonishing omission, do new novels Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace. But if shortlist final six candidates prize may be disappointing, traditional controversy surrounding award is rife ever. One unsurprising omission final selection was When The World Was Steady, first novel Claire Messud, which was 'long list' it was pointed out that author was wife James Wood, chief literary reviewer The Guardian newspaper and Booker judge. Professor John Bayley, chairman Booker panel and husband former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise Mr Wood's failure reveal his relationship Ms Messud. But it is final list, rather controversy, that discredits award according some critics. 'This list,' said one man letters, 'must have dealt final death blow Booker.' The winner, selected original 130, will be announced October 11. The Booker Prize is Britain's literary event year, guaranteed boost sales chosen novel award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner London's ancient Guildhall.

There's team judges and pool candidates.  This year each British publisher could submit three new titles, grand total 93.  As one judge noted wearily, ""By August, I was more slight panic, sometimes reading all day and evening; reading while standing bus stop, reading while cooking, reading, almost, while talking telephone.""Next comes ""short-list,"" judges' top six, which was announced great fanfare late September.

Black Dogs Ian McEwan (Secker & Warburg Pounds 14.99). McEwan's fiction is uniquely disturbing - some would say deliberately offensive. He is novelist misanthropy. This is tale failed marriage, episodically told, and black dogs evil are metaphorical and literal. The English Patient Michael Ondaatje (Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99). The Sri Lankan poet and novelist Ondaatje, who lives Canada, has followed 'in skin lion' extraordinary book four characters Tuscan villa closing months last war.

A deep-sea inspection Bismarck suggests that most powerful battleship Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled its crew rather sunk British celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday. During 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located Bismarck sitting upright and proud two weeks ago. Then American oceanographer, whose father was British background and whose mother was German heritage, addressed himself German people German. I am underwater explorer, not treasure hunter, he said, translating himself back English. We found no human remains. We touched nothing and took nothing. ... The future Bismarck is hands German people. He said he will disclose its exact location only Germany so Germans themselves can decide whether try raise ship, which sank battle May 27, 1941. Ballard, senior scientist Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him that Germans scuttled battleship rather trying surrender or allowing her be sent British fire. Only scuttled ships tend make it bottom one piece, Ballard said. It appears crew opened it its entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem stern. Maybe Germans didn't want it taken war prize, he added. It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered German pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled it was cornered neutral port Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked British ships. Hitler apparently wanted keep British learning secrets Graf Spee's construction and weapons. In 1941 battle, Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked out and attacking British ships were out range her secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking hundreds hits  its sinking clearly inevitable. Rendered unsteerable torpedoes dropped tiny fabric-covered British biplanes, it was unable escape. Asked if German commander couldn't have surrendered ceasing fire, Ballard said fuzz battle fierce seas it would have been unlikely that British would have recognized that Germans were giving up. Again, he speculated, perhaps Germans not want ship's technologically advanced equipment fall British hands. The Bismarck was found Ballard more 15,000 feet water 600 miles west Brest, France. He said it was remarkably good shape, elegant, well preserved. Before battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships pursuit ringing three-word command: Sink Bismarck! Of Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only 115 survived. British ships picked 110 survivors left hundreds German sailors still icy waters spotting what might have been German U-boat. German vessels later rescued only five more survivors. The story has been recounted books, songs and movie. The sinking occurred only eight days Bismarck left Gdynia, Poland, her first operation. If unstopped, it could have posed critical threat convoys merchant shipping and undercut British morale time when England stood virtually alone combined German sea and air power. The British sent warship Hood Bismarck five days going sea Bismarck had sunk Hood three-minute engagement, loss all three vessel's crew 1,419. The Hood was symbol British sea power, and its loss stunned British public and war government and made sinking Bismarck mission crucial importance. Ballard said laws sea, Bismarck remains property German people. The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed same remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago find wreck Titanic, British passenger liner that sank 1912 striking iceberg.

Al Crespo said yacht is balanced delicate living reef, threatening damage coral and sponges. It's also close anchoring spot freighters and other vessels heading port Miami and has been marked flashing buoy, he said. It's close enough that if ship swings its anchor, it could hit it, Crespo said. The Army Corps Engineers said Ostwind must be moved or cut pieces June 22. If it's not, government will remove it and bill Resnick. Resnick blames mistake A.M. Daly Jr., captain tug that towed yacht where it was sunk. Daly, however, said Chris Cadley, captain passenger boat that accompanied him, had agreed lead him site. Cadley denied that, saying he only agreed meet Daly coast. Resnick said someone will have pay.

Greek divers have plunged 162 feet Aegean Sea and back history, finding treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk Greek revolutionaries 1822. The remains wooden sailing ship were found island Chios eastern Aegean point where historical accounts place sinking Ottoman ship, according Peter Nicolaides, diver and salvage expert. The Bourloti Seimaz  or Explosives Invincible  was set afire and sunk Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris revenge Turkish killing and looting Chios. Thousands islanders died Turkish raids, which shocked other nations and swung Western European countries Greek struggle independence Ottoman Empire. Greece won independence 1830. The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced famous picture, The Massacre Chios, based raids. It's incredible discovery, straight out history book we used read school War Independence, Nicolaides said interview Friday The Associated Press. Nicolaides, who heard wreck while teaching underwater archaeology course local divers last winter, started querying fishermen where their nets snagged seabed obstacles. He pinpointed wreck May 3, he said. When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out muddy seabed and dozens objects  Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls, candlestick, chalice Greek Orthodox church, he said. The ship was obviously crammed loot Chios. I think there may be gold and silver items well, he said. I also saw what I recognized human bones, he added. He said wreckage indicated vessel was least 100 feet length. According historians, more 1,000 people  including 400 Greek captives  were ship when Kanaris staged his attack early hours June 7, 1822. The Greek admiral sailed nearby island Psara, towing boat stuffed explosives. Its pointed bow was rammed mouth cannon Bourloti Seimaz and fuse lit. The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, was killed blast that split ship. Kanaris and his crew Greeks escaped. This is very significant, very emotive find, coming this particular period history, said George Papathanassopoulos, Culture Ministry's adviser marine archaeology. Papathanassopoulos said 162-foot water depth site will make investigation difficult underwater archaeology rarely is attempted depths 113 feet, he said, This is ship that must be explored. Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible tap American and Turkish expertise excavate wreck international project. American experts Institute Nautical Archaeology Texas A & M University, working cooperation Turkish divers, have pioneered underwater excavation Turkish Aegean coast. Greek marine archaeologists focus locating and surveying historic wrecks scattered Aegean and rarely carry out excavations. Ferries are safest vessels afloat. But, tragic sinking Estonia loss more 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go toll human life can be high. As ferries increase size, so numbers board risk mechanical failure or crew error go up. The move roll-on roll-off ferries vehicle decks which run entire length vessel has increased risk that, once sea penetrates hold bow doors or gash ship's side, it can lead vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its members, ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought two decades ship safety. But sinking Estonia should lead new review ferry safety. Particularly worrying are eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated bow doors manner reminiscent sinking Herald Free Enterprise 1987. Unlike Herald, Estonia appears have had its doors closed, ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable water penetration. Any review ferry safety should focus three main issues. First subject ferry design should be reconsidered. Additional stability could be provided addition sponsons, stabilising bulges which project ship's side just water line. Greater resistance influx water could be obtained installing moveable barriers or bulkheads break large car decks. These proposals were looked British government wake sinking Herald Free Enterprise. It calculated that it would cost Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m improve standards 57 vessels UK ferry fleet, further Pounds 22m extra annual running costs. Higher costs would inevitably lead higher fares - unwelcome ferry operators when, short cross-Channel routes, they face competition Channel tunnel. But difficulty pushing fare rises would be nothing damaging ferry companies another disaster. Second, IMO and national governments must look closely how improve enforcement existing regulations. The IMO has been trying move enforcement its agenda, it depends good will and professionalism governments and shipowners. Third, IMO should be given support national governments its campaign, launched yesterday, improve crew training. Much regulation recent years has concentrated improving ship and its equipment. Above all, if new regulation does turn out be necessary, it must be introduced speedily. As things stand, it can take years changes are ratified enough governments give them force. The European Union, which Sweden and Finland are getting ready join, could take lead speeding process. Ship safety is not, course, just issue ferry sector. Five (small) ferries were lost last year, according Lloyd's Register. But this figure pales insignificance compared 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also went down. When cargo vessel third-world crew goes distant ocean, very little attention is paid. If loss relatively modern passenger vessel European waters can make shipping safety higher priority governments and public, this will be some small compensation loss life Estonia.

7,d118i,"John G. Tower has fallen, sky has not. For all forecasts dire results if Senate blocked Tower's path Pentagon, business is proceeding usual. President Bush said case was closed and accepted Democratic assurances future cooperation. That doesn't undo resentment some Tower's more ardent Republican allies Senate and some corners White House. Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded assurances support dozen Senate Democrats. They ended only three Democrats close-to-party-line vote Tower. Nevertheless, week former Texas senator was denied confirmation secretary defens, waters have closed. There will be ripples, and some them could be wave-sized. The good-behavior rules set debate Tower's drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain be invoked precedents whenever Republicans spot Democratic target. We've established what will be known Tower standards, said Sen. John Warner, R-Va. That argument will be used House Republicans challenging financial conduct House Speaker Jim Wright. But it will be debating point, not turning point, Wright controversy that was ordained long Tower episode. While President Bush was unwavering his support Tower, he burned no bridges congressional Democrats. He insisted that Tower was best man job and he spoke out repeatedly his choice, it was clear that nomination was doomed. But he didn't get nasty it, saying there was no point escalating fight. That's over, he said 24 hours Tower defeat. That's history. And now we are going go forward. The 53-47 vote Tower was setback Bush sense that it always is defeat when Congress denies president something he wants. But this denial not cost Bush program, or major campaign pledge, or support voters. Indeed, it could turn out that Senate president favor sending Tower back Texas instead Pentagon. It was break Bush could not make political ally who had been Pentagon job Ronald Reagan was elected president. Tower had not been Reagan man  he had supported Bush 1980 nomination. And Reagan White House went some lengths rule senator out job he sought, declaring that new president would not be nominating any Senate Republican any Cabinet post. After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his loyalty, all way losing vote when standard, somewhat safer course would have been withdraw nominee. Tower not only shunned withdrawal; he offered conditions that had be humiliating, if only Senate would let him have job. Tower promised quit drinking, taking pledge national television. And when that didn't work, he offered become first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans proposed that he get job six-month trial and then return reconfirmation, gimmick that would have changed system and could have haunted presidency. No deal. So Tower became ninth Cabinet nominee ever be rejected, first who was former senator. Bush said he had been fighting right president appoint his Cabinet, he avoided language that would have raised political stakes. Tower not restrain himself. Battling job, he said withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be damning president's judgment. He said his nomination had been turned vehicle major presidential defeat. Tower's advocates Senate floor said grave constitutional issues were stake, that authority presidency was line, that Senate will come rue rules it wrote Tower decision. But Bush said all that outcome, either way, would not hurt other issues. Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman Armed Services Committee and pivotal figure Tower defeat, agreed. He told his Georgia constituents that Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's leadership. In Washington, `triumphs' and `setbacks' are short-lived, Nunn said, and that's particularly true president. Retired Sen. John Tower, defense secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday remove colon polyp, hospital spokesman said. Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed fair condition, hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night. The senator is expected make full recovery.

He also served arms negotiator President Reagan and he headed White House's Iran-Contra investigative panel. President-elect Bush designated Tower his defense secretary Dec. 16. The nomination is subject Senate approval. Defense Secretary-designate John Tower contradicted earlier sworn statement when he told Senate his work British firm involved no military matters, according reports published Saturday. Meanwhile, new questions were raised thoroughness FBI's background investigation embattled nominee. One newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including early-morning car crashes and hotel fire, apparently were overlooked probe. The Senate Armed Services Committee has put nomination Tower, former Texas senator and onetime chairman committee, hold while it takes second look Tower's personal habits, including his use alcohol, and his links defense contractors. Tower, who has declined be interviewed while his nomination is pending, has denied his Senate testimony any problem alcohol or any conflicts interest his business ties. A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined Saturday comment latest reports, saying it's (the nomination) committee. Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers Dallas, not answer reporter's calls Saturday. In written testimony Senate panel Jan. 26, Tower said he could recall no actions connection any defense activities connection his work U.S. subsidiary British Aerospace, Inc. That statement, according two publications, The Los Angeles Times and Legal Times, not square information which Tower provided divorce attorneys working his second wife June 1987. In divorce deposition, Tower said he went work British Aerospace eight weeks resigning nation's chief strategic arms negotiator and advised company how sell training jets, fighter planes and missile systems Pentagon, Los Angeles Times reported. Tower told Senate committee he worked chiefly selling commercial aircraft U.S. airlines and also advised firm trade legislation and currency fluctuations. He said he earned $265,000 company June 1986 and last December. The Legal Times said Tower told divorce attorneys that he was retained British Aerospace his advice how sell weapons systems Pentagon, and that he listed various weapons involved. The deposition was never filed court because Tower not contest divorce, copy was obtained FBI, Legal Times said. It said its reporters were allowed attorneys read it understanding that it not be quoted directly. The New York Post reported Saturday that FBI apparently has not bothered talk Tower's neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower. The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said incidents included early-morning episode June 6, 1967, when Tower was trapped his hotel suite Dallas blaze he accidentally set dropping cigarette overstuffed armchair. When firemen broke his room remove him, he was reportedly no condition free himself, Post said. The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car two early-morning accidents weeks one another 1970, and, two years earlier, he drove bicycle ridden James Patrick Montoya, son late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., his way home work. The youth was not seriously hurt. FBI spokesman Bill Carter refused comment specifics Tower investigation, said We will follow any lead. On Friday, Tower authorized release statement that recent hospital tests showed no evidence alcohol abuse, and Vice President Dan Quayle said, I have never seen drinking being factor John Tower's life other social glass wine. Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was no question that Tower sometimes drank too much early 1970s, he said: He is not alcoholic. He's not had drinking problem years.

He fought freedom and worked diligently make world more secure.""; ""It's so sad,"" Bush said. ""It is tragic loss."" Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued terse statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower refused comment published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used drink bottle scotch sitting. An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement Tower's drinking habits 1970s came Sen. Sam Nunn, committee chairman, ton bricks and was factor Nunn's opposition nomination. The newspaper reported that Combest later gave different story FBI, saying that Tower and group friends  not Tower alone  had frequently consumed bottle scotch. After meeting staff and advisers, Combest, who worked then-Sen. Tower 1970s, issued two-sentence statement supporting his fellow Texan. As member Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence senator and his abilities lead this country's armed forces. In my judgment, John Tower will be superb secretary defense, statement said. Combest spokesman Rich Adams refused comment further, and said Combest was not available speak reporters. The Washington Post reported that Combest described Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner Virginia, ranking Republican committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts 1970s. A congressional source was quoted saying that Combest told senators that Tower would drink much full bottle scotch two or three times week. Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, told Post that Combest originally went Nunn and Warner tell them Tower had ended his previous excessive abuse alcohol. Boyd also told Post that group people drank entire bottle scotch, not Tower alone. That was account Combest gave FBI his talk Nunn and Warner, newspaper said. It said that that account, Combest said that he had only seen Tower drunk two or three occasions. Tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively 1970s, says he has reduced his intake wine dinner. On Sunday, he promised not drink drop alcohol if confirmed defense secretary. Combest, 43, worked Tower seven years, 1971-1978, legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy. Tower served Senate 24 years, deciding not seek re-election 1984. He was chairman Senate Armed Services Committee 1981 1984. The committee, now controlled Democrats, voted 11-9 party lines last Thursday recommend full Senate reject Tower's nomination. You would obviously expect Mr. Tower say no, and he obliges: volubly and passionately. If that was all there was ""Consequences,"" we could scan dust jacket and invest our savings local real estate. ""Consequences"" reads bit political Stephen King story small senator swelled Beltway monster. Politics never has been squeamish, Tower controversy leaves much more disagreeable taste senator's caperings (which mostly took place '70s anyway). Were writing less stiff and narrative technique less choppy, ""Consequences"" might have been classic case study late 20th-century politics out control. Given Mr. Tower's qualifications job -- intelligence, patriotism and chairmanship Armed Services Committee -- nomination should have sailed flying colors. Instead it sank Bismarck. Clearly and apparently his surprise, Mr. Tower had made many enemies his arrival Washington 1961, rubbing supporters wrong way. The senator Lone Star State could be lordly, his English-cut suits. Once, meeting editors my newspaper which had backed him strongly, he thought nothing tilting back his chair, crossing his tiny, well-shod feet atop conference table. When Tower hearings opened, all manner accusations came public notice. The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claimed have seen senator consorting A Lady Not His Wife. It was reported that Mr. Tower had chased secretary his desk and had fondled women Bergstrom Air Force Base. The second wife, whom senator had recently divorced, possessed repertory tales she cheerfully volunteered. At his hotel, Mr. Tower was accorded that doubtful tribute instant-celebrity status, media stakeout. The nominee issued fervent denials: He drank only wine, having long sworn scotch; he'd never chased secretaries; his services defense-industry clients had been proper and modest. None charges, least Mr. Tower's showing, proved have least substance. No use. Dirt is dirtier purity is pure, one John O'Hara's characters observes. Sen. Sam Nunn, Mr. Tower's successor Armed Services Committee chairman, seemed initially smile nomination; then rumor mill started churning and he changed fronts. While endeavoring look statesmanlike, Sen. Nunn leaned moderate Democrats who would otherwise have supported Tower. Sen. Nunn made campaign personal, says Mr. Tower -- vote me or vote him. Most Democrats, end, went Sen. Nunn. What was all this about? Morality? Mr. Tower suggests instead that Sen. Nunn, presidential hopeful, discovered and seized opportunity show who was really No. 1 national defense. Sen. Nunn had every reason know that moral and ethical charges leveled Mr. Tower, and investigated exhaustively FBI, were flimsy. Yet he waved them anyway. When media retailed lurid and unsubstantiated stories, Sen. Nunn pursed his lips Georgia Sunday-school superintendent and suggested that drunken Mr. Tower might accidentally press nuclear button. ""Sam Nunn,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""used FBI inquiries discredit me and strike president United States. The essential chain good judgment and goodwill broke my confirmation process."" Sen. Nunn has company Mr. Tower's dishonor roll. There is Sen. Ernest Hollings (""a study arrogance and pomposity""), Sen. James Exon (""one most excessive regular boozers Senate"") and NBC's Andrea Mitchell (""the most viciously partisan reporter I've ever seen""), Washington press corps. Sen. John Warner, Republican, is depicted falling all himself stay good Sen. Nunn. Mr. Tower feels, not reason, that he was arraigned morals charges cynical colleagues and media personages whom no one ever mistook Southern Baptist deacons. ""I don't so much resent my rejection Senate,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""as way it was done."" ""Tower, you were lynched,"" Mike Wallace, CBS correspondent, told him. Worse yet, lynch mob remains large. --- Mr. Murchison is senior columnist Dallas Morning News. The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected nomination former Texas Sen. John Tower defense secretary, delivering major rebuke President Bush just 49 days his term. The Senate's 53-47 vote came bitter and divisive debate focused Tower's drinking habits, behavior women and his business dealings defense contractors. It was only ninth time 200 years that Senate has voted reject president's Cabinet choice and only time it has done so early new administration. Vice President Dan Quayle presided Senate roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment nominee. The Senate galleries were packed and virtually all senators were their seats roll was called.

Nancy Kassebaum provided biggest surprise final hours debate when she became sole Republican declare her opposition. She said her most serious concerns were Tower's activities defense consultant serving arms control negotiator. She also expressed doubts that he would pay enough attention ensuring fairness women military. Tower's Republican defenders began speak him tense and nominee also appeared accept defeat, roll was called. Just moments ago I took call John Tower, said Sen. John Warner Virginia, senior GOP member Senate Armed Services Committee. His head is high, his voice is strong, Warner said. He asked me convey thanks  his words  troops who rallied his support. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, moved repair damage caused bitter struggle relations Senate and President Bush. I know what's my heart and my mind, he told reporters. I want directly, clearly and unambiguously say that this doesn't represent effort be harmful president. Dole agreed late-afternoon vote nomination acknowledging collapse last-minute bid give Tower extraordinary six-month trial period defense secretary prove he could abstain drinking. There was no doubt outcome Senate went motions debating nomination final hours roll call. The last few undecided senators declared their positions. Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., said he would vote Tower. Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said he would support nomination. Senators parties credited Tower's defeat decision oppose him made Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman Armed Services Committee. When he made his decision all other Democrats wheeled him, said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. With prospect defeat seemingly inevitable, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, If necessary, we'll come (new) candidate very rapidly. Names most frequently mentioned White House speculation replacement Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, former secretary Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. Scowcroft replied No when asked this morning if he was line Pentagon job. It must be clear all that people chief staff and national security adviser, any number congressmen and senators and any number other experts have candidates tip their tongue, Fitzwater said. But time has not come, he added. The time will come soon vote is completed. We will wait then. The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and one Republican committed vote Tower or leaning strongly that direction. It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats declared Tower or leaning his way. Nevertheless, White House said it wanted see nomination go all way vote. Tower, meanwhile, reported work Pentagon where he and his three daughters had coffee together. He then continued review various administration proposals. I hope and believe we can work together important matters, Mitchell said. The tension this issue will have no long-lasting effect relationship. I want say bottom my heart that I hope this will be case. The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed was dealt crushing blow Wednesday parade previously undecided Democratic senators announced they would vote no. Only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen Texas said he would vote yes, joining just two other Democrats who have made that decision. Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J.

Countries around the world, both friendly and hostile to Iran's Islamic government, responded quickly. The aid from the United States, including funds and supplies raised by Iranians in California , was channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This was a rare example of U.S.-Iranian cooperation after the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Countries as diverse as Egypt, China, India, Malaysia and the Soviet Union sent help. Even Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born author of ""Satanic Verses,"" condemned to death by the Iranian ayatollahs, contributed $8,600. All was not sweetness and light, however.

Iran has said it would welcome such supplies. An opposition group as accused the Iranian government underestimating the number of casualties and of devoting all of its resources to a war with Iran rather than providing adequate housing. On the other hand, an anti-American newspaper in Iran said the U.S. was partly to blame because it caused the Iranians to divert needed cash fromHousing projects and building earthquake resistant buildings.

For first time their thousand-year history, Russians asserted their independence autocracy, and autocrats fell.;There will be much sort out months ahead. But almost certainly failure counterrevolution will accelerate democratic revolution it tried choke. That revolution will alter country, creating new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much more quickly anyone anticipated.;Gorbachev's standing also will be transformed these events. It seems unlikely that he can escape consequences his miscalculations -- especially miscalculation that led him embrace very men who led this putsch his rule. Gorbachev was most resourceful and creative political leader late 20th century, this week he was trumped Boris Yeltsin, who will now rightly be seen man who saved him.;Yeltsin had two talents that Gorbachev lacked. One was ability stay close Russian people their world was transformed Gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping victory this spring's first presidential election Russia and Gorbachev's abysmal standing polls.

Instead, they turned out be mortal enemies.;If they had been only personal enemies, Gorbachev might have been undone them. But when they closed new, liberal news media and reverted Stalinist tradition big lie, members State Emergency Committee threatened not just Gorbachev also new Soviet Union -- society that offered its citizens unprecedented opportunity dignity, self-reliance and freedom.

He also refused acquiesce state emergency that those responsible coup apparently asked him endorse last weekend.;It is intriguing assessing coup's failure that men trained thugs some most violent and mean-spirited institutions created any state could not, their moment truth, behave thugs and kill their compatriots. They left Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin large; they let Western media report their coup it unfolded; and they allowed foreign radio stations broadcast news it back country. Even their news media, strict control, conveyed fact that there was widespread resistance their attempted coup.;By Tuesday night, Emergency Committee was confrontation political legitimacy Yeltsin, and this proved unequal contest. As Gorbachev had previously discovered his negotiations Yeltsin new union treaty, legitimacy provided 50 million votes that Yeltsin received elections president Russian federation was formidable political force.;At first blush, botching coup was surprising -- couldn't vaunted KGB and its allies run efficient putsch? But these were representatives political class that turned one world's richest nations basket case. Perhaps their coup should be seen desperate and forlorn effort deny truth that proved undeniable -- that Stalinist system had failed so utterly there was simply no way redeem it. Gorbachev chose ignore warnings right's impending attempt seize power. Some warnings came Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such Alexander Yakovlev, shortly coup. But, incredibly, clearest signals came hard-liners themselves.;A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known ""nightingale General Staff,"" published transcript his conversation head General Staff Academy, commander-in-chief Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov. With remarkable candor, Baklanov called military takeover appropriate step avert reforms that would result fundamental transformation union. Needless say, Baklanov delivered that warning and joined Gang Eight.;Gorbachev ignored these warnings.;To some -- admitted minority -- thought Gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably range traditional Soviet art deception known maskirovka. And laymen, something that odd could make sense country where illness can mean anything flu precipitous fall power.;The most volatile fuel conspiracy theory came directly Gorbachev himself, his Thursday news conference which he described his three days house arrest Crimea.;Among questions: If Gorbachev's 32 armed guards remained loyal him throughout, why was there no conflict opposition delegation that notified president coup? Why didn't coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or least separate them him?;If Gorbachev's contact world was limited intercepting Western radio outlets ancient shortwave radio, how was he able describe news conference given collaborators, his view their trembling hands?;It is highly unlikely that hard-liners had been set or ordered Gorbachev launch hopeless coup attempt order improve his political standing. Such scenario would require unprecedented degree selfless commitment Gorbachev their part.;A more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev was initially full member conspiracy, which, his participation, could have clung fig leaf constitutionality and would have thwarted new Union Treaty, have been signed last Tuesday, which provided transfer key levers power federal presidency leaders republics.;It is possible that, unwilling take huge risk and openly side hard-liners start coup, Gorbachev had decided become ill and wait out initial phase virtually self-imposed confinement his summer residence.;Gorbachev reveal, however, that two important officials had visited him Crimea outset coup. One was head KGB department responsible security Soviet leaders; other was V. Boldin, Gorbachev's closest aide, president's admission man absolute loyalty him. One can't help wonder whether these two visitors came deliver ultimatum Gorbachev and put him arrest event his non-compliance, or deliver important documents fellow junta members outset their joint enterprise.;Conspiracy theorists grope motives -- Gorbachev wanted ferret out disloyal elements his government, make himself hero and delay scheduled signing treaty that would have lessened his powers. But there is virtually unanimous agreement one point. Gorbachev put power very hard-liners who fronted coup and kept them power their vocal mutterings him. Cut row dour Communists ill-fitting gray suits announcing Gorbachev's illness and palace coup.

Conquest said. ""That would be going bit far."";A more intriguing scenario has Gorbachev conspiring coup plotters engineer transformation Soviet political landscape. The thinking goes this:;With his popularity rock bottom, Gorbachev, lifelong creature KGB, hatches false coup order step out way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other. The coup falls apart and Gorbachev triumphantly returns level legitimacy he never enjoyed before.;The theory could explain apparent bungling coup plotters, said author Joseph Finder, whose 1991 novel, ""The Moscow Club,"" foreshadowed many elements current crisis.;Finder, who said he not subscribe scenario, nonetheless pointed out that tanks not begin roll hours Gorbachev's supposed arrest. Russian President Boris Yeltsin was not arrested, and Leningrad was left alone.;Speculation was not unique Kremlin watchers United States.;Theorizing was rampant streets Moscow Tuesday, said San Francisco businesswoman Kimberly Getto, who sent long fax detailing speculation, fueled fact that many tanks encircling Russian parliament building had no ammunition. Gorbachev not want bloodshed, according theory.;The Democratic Reform Movement, headed former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's longtime ally, floated same possibility statement Monday.;""It's highly implausible, not be excluded, that Gorbachev himself agreed withdrawal, thinking he'd show them they still needed him,"" said Norman Naimark, director Stanford's Center Russian and East European Studies. ""The degree connivance is difficult gauge.""

But all one can tell, this trial was handled professionally judge, Justice Michael Stegmann.; The reaction verdict and six-year prison sentence was also mild. Surprisingly few supporters gathered court cheer Mrs. Mandela. The ANC issued detached statement saying that last word had not been spoken case. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said ""the movement is larger any individual.""; A more fundamental reason hope is that F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela -- and those whom they speak -- have common interest creating new, non-racial South Africa. They need each other. Without their agreement, there can be no solution, no outcome that leaves viable country.; The next step is formal negotiations. They can come only when government takes further steps meet reasonable ANC demand action violence -- particular, ban carrying so-called ""cultural"" weapons such spears.

Gorbachev Friday proposed tougher legislation punish Soviets who seek kindle ethnic unrest, saying nationalist passions benefit opponents his reforms. The Soviet leader told meeting Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening some regions country, due part active resistance put perestroika corrupt groups. Perestroika, or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program widespread economic and social change. State-run media also indicated Friday that crackdown had begun people Armenia who continue agitate annexation mostly Armenian enclave neighboring republic Azerbaijan. The six-month conflict two republics control Nagorno-Karabakh district has led mass rallies, strikes and ethnic violence February. The Supreme Soviet Presidium, government's top executive body, intervened July 18. It rejected any change Nagorno-Karabakh's status called measures develop region's economy and culture. The conflict Nagorno-Karabakh is one most rancorous domestic disputes faced Gorbachev he became Communist Party chief March 1985. He indicated Friday he wants defuse tensions ethnic groups, also punish those who transform tensions political crisis. Gorbachev spoke plenary meeting Central Committee, party's policy-making body. A summary his remarks was distributed official Tass news agency. Gorbachev outlined reasons current aggravation tensions ethnic groups some regions Soviet Union, Tass said. Among causes, Gorbachev listed lack concern many years specific requirements peoples and ethnic groups, inadequate control masses activities executive personnel, and active resistance put perestroika corrupt groups. Tass said that Gorbachev noted that nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces, he suggested increasing accountability Soviet laws kindling ethnic strife. Tass not give details Gorbachev's suggestion. At July 18 Presidium meeting, Soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms hiding Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive. Gorbachev said grounds tougher legislation come directly Article 36 1977 Soviet Constitution, which says law can punish any advocacy racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt. Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals how resolve ethnic tensions, including increase power each country's 15 republics, law equal use more 100 languages spoken Soviet Union and some economic autonomy country's republics and regions. In particular, Baltic republics Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, forcibly incorporated Soviet Union 1940, have demanded more say their economic and government affairs. The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people Yerevan, Armenia's capital, will face criminal charges incident which activists seeking annexation Nagorno-Karabakh attached slogans their cars and drove city. The paper not give date or size mobile demonstration, said 155 drivers have had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined. In its July 18th decision, Presidium also ordered local law enforcement agencies ensure order was restored Caucasus Mountain region. Tass reported Friday that situation was stabilizing Armenia, said that urging instigators, some strikes and protests were continuing. The international community is starting look conflict former Yugoslavia, and is becoming increasingly aware true magnitude and seriousness ethnic and political conflicts former Soviet Union. The problem is indeed pressing one. The disputes Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere former Soviet Union are causing great suffering those involved. They are source legitimate concern Russians, who are worried clashes close their borders. They are concerned too safety ethnic Russians living those countries where there are conflicts, and economic and social consequences refugees fleeing Russia (whose potential number is estimated more 2m). They believe that problems some former Soviet republics are either ignored or misunderstood. The Russians fear that if they do nothing, conflicts will worsen and probably spread. They argue that they have legitimate concern trying resolve conflicts that threaten their security. They ask why, when international community is engaged peacemaking and peacekeeping many world's trouble spots, similar efforts should not be undertaken hot spots them. Equally, these disputes are legitimate concern Britain, its western partners and whole international community, humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability. If uncontrolled, they pose variety threats European security, including increased traffic drugs and arms well international terrorism. Crises Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations west: unless they are carefully handled, they risk prejudicing emerging relationship us. The west is sometimes suspicious Moscow's attitude. There are no differences need resolve these conflicts: there are differences how go it. The British government will not underwrite Russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn occupying forces. Nor are countries that secured their independence when Soviet Union was dissolved keen that west should concede Moscow same role it played Soviet empire. They fear that this would compromise their sovereignty. When they are willing Russian troops play peacekeeping role, they want there be some form international monitoring. This has meant that, though west lacks resources engage directly those trouble spots, it has been wary appearing endorse Russian involvement instead, case it had imperial tendencies. If we are fashion joint approach Russia and its western partners problem peacekeeping former Soviet Union, we must address all these concerns. Clearly Russia has important role play this area. If Russians want international recognition and more active support international community, west turn needs guarantees that Russia will not regard recognition its involvement giving it carte blanche former Soviet Union. Peace-keeping former Soviet Union, indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply internationally recognised principles. It needs be looked case case basis. Respect sovereignty newly independent countries must remain paramount. We agreed that principles underlying Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operations would need include: strict respect sovereignty countries involved; invitation government concerned and consent parties conflict; commitment parallel political peace process; clear mandate setting out role peacekeeping forces (which should whenever possible be multinational character); and exit strategy peacekeeping forces deployed. These principles should help stimulate dialogue and political settlement parties conflict, focus attention and, where possible, resources settlement conflicts former Soviet Union. All this will help enhance Russian peacekeeping practices. Although Conference Security and Co-operation Europe and UN lack resources put large numbers peacekeepers ground themselves, they may be able suggest measures enhance transparency and monitor peace process. Extending co-operation North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and also co-operation Russia and Nato, might help improve training Russian peacekeepers. This is area we shall need explore further. We also need put much more emphasis preventive diplomacy. One ways which we can help prevent conflicts is strengthen democratic institutions newly independent countries former Soviet Union. The CSCE and other international institutions can play important role here, drawing newly independent countries more active dialogue ways promoting democratic values and principles. We discussed ways strengthening CSCE's role, including role High Commissioner National Minorities, recent Rome ministerial meeting. We must try find ways managing and resolving tensions they erupt conflict. It will not be easy, we must try. Potentially explosive cocktails ethnic and political animosities could spread fire intolerance all too easily other countries and regions. We need deal it together spirit partnership. And we need deal it urgently. Our security is indivisible and we must ensure it vigorous and imaginative efforts aimed promoting peace all well rights all.

The Ingush, who declared independent state June, are demanding return lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated 1944 and declared part North Ossetia. Mr Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar held emergency meetings crisis Saturday and yesterday. At same time, North Ossetian government said it would distribute Russian army-supplied automatic weapons civilian volunteers. 'The Russian authorities are strong enough make all those violating law respect it,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's specialist Caucasus, told Russian television. The Russian action mirrored recent developments former Soviet republic Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed.

The Caucasus mountains, which stretch southern Russia borders Turkey and Iran, are engulfed several conflicts. Among them are Georgia's war Abkhazian separatists, and Azerbaijan's conflict ethnic Armenians Nagorno-Karabakh. Moldavia, acting defuse one Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday comply Kremlin order reconsider its law making Moldavian republic's official language. The republic's parliament acted response decree issued Dec. 22 President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, official news agency Tass reported. Gorbachev also gave republic 10 days dissolve new national guard and come measures guaranteeing equal rights all ethnic groups its borders. Tass said Moldavan parliament agreed disband nationalguard and revise law that Gorbachev said restricted rights minorities. Ethnic tension has gripped Moldavia, largely agricultural republic bordering Romania, its push independence Soviet Union this year. The unrest turned violent last month, when government troops clashed activists, leaving four dead. Gorbachev said conflicts had reached critical levels, and he put part blame Moldavian Supreme Soviet enacting laws that discriminate minorities. Alarmed rising Moldavian nationalism, two republic's minority groups have begun their separatist movements. The Gagauz, group 150,000 Turkish Christians, declared new republic southern Moldavia. In eastern part Moldavia, more 300,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have joined declaring new republic Dneister River. All three groups claim discrimination Moldavians. In particular, they resent new law making Moldavian official language and requiring people dozens jobs ranging doctors hairdressers pass Moldavian language tests 1995. Tass not say how Moldavian parliament would modify law. Moldavian is identical Romanian Cyrillic script Josef Stalin imposed republic. It is spoken two-thirds republic's residents. Soviet hard-liners want Gorbachev impose state emergency and presidential rule troubled zones throughout ethnically and geographically diverse country. Gorbachev said declaration Gagauz and Dniester republics was illegal Soviet and Moldavian constitutions, were elections form legislatures and any actions those bodies. The Moldavian legislature has also voted declare elections null and void. After residents Gagauz region began holding local elections late October, Moldavian legislature clamped two-month state emergency region, restricting movement and out area and banning public rallies. Volunteer brigades college-age Moldavians, who then flocked region try stop separatist movement, were ordered dissolved Gorbachev's decree. The volunteers were organized nationalist groups, including Moldavian People's Front. A CEASEFIRE Moldova was threatened yesterday when truck driver transporting militiamen was shot dead machinegun fire self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home Russian-speaking minority. The shooting came shortly ceasefire came effect Moldovan authorities, dominated ethnic Romanians, and minority based republic east bank river Dnestr. At least nine people have been killed clashes week. As more severe conflict Nagorno-Karabakh, underlying tensions are growing and neither side believes it is losing. In other respects, however, conflicts are quite different and illustrate complexity conflict which former Soviet Union is now faced. The Trans Dnestr conflict stems directly breakup Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh has been source tension Azeris and Armenians centuries. Moldova (formerly Moldavia) was finally taken full Soviet control 1944. The Soviet leadership sought stifle any attempts preserve its former links Romania - calling Moldovan separate language Romanian, and constructing separate history Moldovan people. Industry was largely situated left bank Dnestr, sliver republic next Ukraine, and largely staffed Russians and Ukrainians. Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 cent population, Moldovans accounting 64 cent. The little republic (4.5m people) was slow respond stirrings reform. When it did, 1989, language movement quickly put hardline Communist Party defensive and it lost power 1990 present nationalist government, headed President Mircea Snegur, former secretary Moldovan Party's central committee. From beginning nationalist movement, it was clear that Russian and, lesser extent, Ukrainian minorities would be hostile, reacting laws establishing Moldovan official language and calls renewed union Romania strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov. During August coup last year, Moldovan government stoutly rejected it and Trans Dnestr authorities welcomed it, siding Soviet army its brief efforts impose military rule. Thereafter, two sides have gathered military forces. The Trans Dnestr side has been augmented Cossacks nearby areas returning their traditional role defenders Russia's borders. The daily Izvestia reported yesterday that Cossacks appear have appointed themselves mercenaries Russians (they are paid Rbs2,000 Rbs5,000 week Trans Dnestr authorities). TROOPS OF former Soviet Union were ordered pull out Armenian enclave Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday they were fired clashes Azeri and Armenian militants. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, Commonwealth Independent States' defence minister, announced decision fighting worsened disputed territory spite efforts secure truce. The enclave is administered Azerbaijan largely populated Armenians. The order pull-out 366th motorised regiment follows deaths earlier this week handful soldiers caught fighting Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces. Fighting flared again yesterday capital Stepanakert, where regiment is based. Azerbaijani and Armenian officials claimed their civilian targets were particularly vicious attack. Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather allow them become targets ethnic conflicts former Soviet Union. No dates have been given withdrawal. Troops fire Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn. Commanders Trans-Caucasus military district, which encompasses Georgia well Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered rebuff attacks military installations. Azeri and Armenian officials say sophisticated weapons, including combat helicopters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers, are being used guerrillas sides four-year-old conflict. Armenian militants attacked last Azeri stronghold Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday, according Azerbaijan's interior ministry, which said residents town Shusha fled helicopter gunships swooped snow-covered mountains. Armenians enclave want unification Armenia, Azerbaijan will not give any territory. Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 this month Central Asian republic Kirghizia, official news agency Tass said Wednesday. Tass said 748 injured had be hospitalized and said search was continuing police officer who vanished June 7. No new outbreaks were reported region border city Osh western Kirghizia, where clashes arising land dispute began June 2 ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, Sunni Moslems. The argument involves allocation land densly populated region where housing is scarce. It was latest series bloody civil conflicts trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government. Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief Interior Ministry's Political Department, said that two years civil strife  mainly ethnic clashes  Soviet Union, 24,000 people have been arrested. He said Moscow Tuesday that ministry troops had be used 13 regions Soviet Union because such outbreaks, Tass said. Grienko said 16 ministry soldiers were killed, four were reported missing and more 1,000 wounded. Tass not quote Grienko how civilians casualties. The general was quoted saying these conflicts were accompanied riots and pogroms, arson and massacre innocent people, (and) complete or partial destabilization situation. Besides unrest this month Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence also has been reported recent years Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan. The government has decided give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled their homelands Josef Stalin their autonomous regions it will take years, Tass reported Wednesday. The ice has been broken. A start has been made. We're working creating such autonomy, said Rafik Nishanov, chairman chamber Soviet legislature, remarks carried official news agency. However, he said, nuts and bolts how create regions still had be worked out. For example, 10-year program resettlement. People can't just be expelled area move in. The Tatars Crimea and ethnic Germans who lived Volga River were forcibly resettled World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked peoples out their homelands grounds they could not be trusted occupy strategic areas. The Tatars and Germans, others, long have been agitating return Siberia and Central Asia their traditional lands, and last month Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated. But other people now occupy lands and houses that belonged exiles, and re-establishing their dominion their home regions will not be so simple. The Supreme Soviet took basic decision that two autonmous regions should be created Nov. 28 kept it quiet, apparently fearing explosive reactions populations now living regions. It was also potentially dangerous precedent: The Soviet Union is patchwork well 100 ethnic groups, and many them have outstanding territorial claims. Trouble already has been reported ethnic Germans and Russians several cities Volga. Residents Saratov and Volgograd regions have protested prospect seeing many nation's estimated 2 million Germans descending them. Ethnographers estimate there are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars Soviet Union, and another 1 million Turkey. Their protests Kremlin 1987 demanding be allowed return their homeland were first tests President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promises greater democracy. Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back Crimea each year lack wholesale permission return. A wave some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrated West Germany this year, many would probably stay if they could be assured their republic, said Irina Ostroukh, researcher Soviet Institute Ethnography who studies ethnic Germans. The Nov. 28 plan approved Supreme Soviet recommended German region areas where resistance German resettlement was strongest order avoid ethnic conflicts. The explosive conflict Armenians and Azerbaijanis Nagorno-Karabakh region has led 200 deaths and hundreds thousands refugees last two years. Both sides claim control mountainous enclave. The Supreme Soviet charged government creating commmission determine how create regions Germans and Crimean Tatars. RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops stop ethnic fighting disputed region South Ossetia first peace-keeping operation collapse Soviet Union, Reuter reports Moscow. Reports remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds heavily armed Russian troops 104th paratroop battalion moved 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia rest Georgia. Georgian national guards occupied similar positions their side border and pulled out all their men South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali.

18,d107g,"Public interest Earth's troubled climate may be washed away heavy rains that are needed end current U.S. drought, weather experts warned drought symposium here. Society tends flit hysteria hysteria, said Pat Michaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator symposium. He said 1988 drought, although not dry 1986 drought many places, has drawn much attention because some affected areas include large media centers. I'm worried ... that when next drought happens, we are going have rediscover climate problem, said Michaels, president Association State Climatologists. Experts said Thursday that greenhouse effect  warming Earth's atmosphere  has brought needed attention changes global climate, though it is not directly related drought. Many 13 climatologists and meterologists symposium agreed that Earth's temperature is warming, they debated whether it is short- or long-term phenomenon and its impact Earth. However, Alan Hecht, director National Climate Program Washington, D.C., said uncertainty means policymakers should begin deal possible effects, especially undertaking policies that make sense their right. Mankind must reduce reliance fossil fuels, he said, becoming more energy efficient, replanting forests and investigating alternative energy supplies. Scientists have warned recent years that Earth's atmosphere is gaining carbon dioxide and other gases, which trap heat and cause overall temperature rise. Besides fossil fuels, depletion forests South America has been blamed increase carbon dioxide and methane. Some have warned that higher temperature will change character many countries, example drying out U.S. Midwest or melting polar ice caps. The symposium was sponsored The Weather Channel, Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast meeting live. Earlier Thursday, climatologists were told movement planets and moon and sunspots may help lead drought Southeast. There is some evidence that Jupiter goes sun its fastest point, there are drought conditions Southeast months April and October, Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer said. However, David Rodenhuis, director federal Climate Analysis Center Washington, said he was skeptical Plummer's thesis. There's enormous number possibilities that one could chase, Rodenhuis said. The next business scientist is ... extend range analysis and look cause and effect. The crippling drought hitting North America is expected reduce world grain stocks levels that may cause food shortages many poor countries, U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported today. The agency projects world cereal production 1988 total 1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more last year's level, which was already expected production. If drought United States ended now, grain production would fall close low levels 1983, when drought and farmers' participation government crop reduction program decreased output, agency reported. As result, world grain stocks are projected fall 310 million tons, or 17 percent level agency considers necessary safeguard world food security, report said. If crop conditions United States and Canada continue deteriorate, ratio could drop further. Such development would have serious implications food security, particularly many low-income, food-deficit countries, report said. The high grain prices resulting lower supply would hit poor, food-importing countries hardest, U.N. agency warned. It said rising prices could also reduce food aid developed countries. The most severely hit crops are coarse grains  mostly maize, barley and oats, report said. The agency projected good harvests other parts world. In Asia yearly monsoon rains started time, and production Europe and Soviet is expected be larger last year. Grain production South America should be slightly lower this year last. In Sahel region sub-Saharan Africa, however, locusts flourishing unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this year's harvest. Potential crop losses pests could hit 1 million tons, FAO said. Weather experts discussed drought Thursday and its possible causes and effects, and said they hoped produce consensus how much longer it will last. All speakers 1988 Drought Symposium called more research and study. There's enormous number possibilities that one could chase. The next business scientist is eliminate possibilities ... and extend range analysis and look cause and effect, said David Rodenhuis, director federal Climate Analysis Center Washington. The symposium attended 13 state and national experts was sponsored The Weather Channel, Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast meeting live. John Hope, network's hurricane specialist and former forecaster National Hurricane Center Miami, Fla., said drought Southeast might be lessened or ended next few months heavier normal hurricane season. Hope said current weather conditions point more tropical storms, more which should become hurricanes, this hurricane season. He stressed that hurricane's effect drought is variable, depending intensity and speed storm. Nevertheless, he said, some Southeastern states get much 25 pecent their rainfall some months hurricanes.

That area, which includes major grain-growing states where crops already are suffering, is given 55 percent chance less normal rainfall. And some states center area, stretching West Virginia Nebraska and Wisconsin Missouri, may be drier. They are given 60 percent chance being short precipitation. A slice southern California, including Los Angeles, is driest area forecast, 70 percent chance having normal rainfall. The rest coastal California also will be dry, forecast said. The outlook also says there's 55 percent chance hotter normal temperatures U.S. heartland New England Idaho and Canadian border Oklahoma. Within that area, chances high temperatures are 65 percent Wyoming, while central Midwestern states have 60 percent chance average temperatures. Wetter normal weather is predicted west and south Texas, and parts New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Normal precipitation is forecast Atlantic and Gulf coast states, Northwest and northern Mountain States. The Weather Service said normal temperatures are expected Atlantic states Virginia south, and Gulf Coast states. West Texas and New Mexico may be cooler normal, far West is expected see its normal quota summer heat. The separate drought impact assessment, issued National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, points out that predicting end drought is complex thing, dry spells have no normal lifetime. The low 4 percent probability end 3 months is based simply statistical analysis droughts, agency said. The report noted that end June, 29 percent continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme drought, parts 35 states affected. That puts current drought same level one 1911, still less severe droughts 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934.

Crews began installing pumps barges Monday haul fresh water southern Louisiana towns plagued rising salt levels lower Mississippi River. Meanwhile, House Speaker Jim Wright said Washington he hopes that relief package disaster payments $100,000 drought-stricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready floor action Congress this week. Here is state-by-state summary latest drought developments: The drought may force government ease crop acreage controls next year help United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday. But United States will continue be major player world agriculture and 1989 should be able bounce back this year's drought losses, he said. Lyng's remarks were prepared delivery meeting farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors. A larger portion United States suffered some degree drought stress May and June any point records began 1895, he said. Moreover, July 2, 35 percent contiguous United States was severe extreme drought category, he said. In 1934, more 60 percent was so rated, and August 1954 more 50 percent was that category. Because large early season area now experiencing drought U.S., 1988 appears have potential approach or exceed drought-affected areas 1930s and 1950s, Lyng said. Even severe drought, there will be adequate supply food grains and livestock feed grains so that United States will be able take care our domestic needs and our export demand, he said. Lyng said total consumption 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less previously estimated because prices are much higher. But it is important note that we will have no shortages, that we will still be able accommodate needs our overseas buyers, he said.","AP880715-0065,AP880711-0056,AP880714-0156,AP880713-0121,AP880713-0175,AP880714-0085,AP880712-0250,AP880716-0052,AP880711-0221",Worst drought in nearly a century affects major grain growing areas.,"The worst drought to hit the United States since 1895, when record keeping began, has damaged grain crops in the major grain growing states and could lead to food shortages in poorer nations.

State radio said Saddam had ordered formation 11 new Iraqi army divisions, expected generate 100,000 troops. The Arab world's most formidible military force is already estimated 1 million men.

No photographs named leaders have been shown and 12 reporters brought Kuwait Ministry Information could not locate any them. Kuwaiti diplomats said they were all Iraqis, including son-in-law Saddam, charge official Iraqi media denied. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seemed determined solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions dethroning government neighboring Kuwait. The invasion, unprecedented modern Arab history, reflected brutality Saddam has used crush all opposition home coming power 1979. The sentence criticizing Saddam is death, and president considered Kuwait's oil overproduction and subsequent fall price oil personal affront Iraq. Iraqis will not forget saying that cutting necks is better cutting means living. Oh God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them, he said last month prices tumbled $14 barrel. He accused Kuwait and United Arab Emirates costing Iraq $14 billion lost oil revenue ignoring their quotas assigned Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries. He also accused Kuwait stealing $2.4 billion pumping oil disputed field that straddled their border, and demanded that Kuwait write estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraq Persian Gulf war. Saddam was reported be incensed that Kuwait was demanding repayment wartime loans. Saddam said he fought war protect Arabs fundamentalist revolution fomented late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini Persian, mainly Shiite Moslem Iran. Never mind that Iraq started war 1980 invading Iran series border skirmishes Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet Gulf. Despite claims that war was unprecedented victory, long conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging eight years. It has still not formally ended. The war bills kept government delivering material benefits promised Iraqi people directly war. The 1990 budget slashed funds imports and Iraqis were told brace another year austerity. Private investment has failed take hold. Iraq ended war estimated $70 billion debt. Its main gulf port Basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure damaged. Tens thousands Iraqi prisoners war languish Iranian prisons and estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded. Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's 100 billion barrels. By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve financial hangover Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstanding wish more gulf coastline. Iraq's 100,000 troops massed border few weeks were believed part pressure campaign make Kuwait capitulate Iraq's demands. But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago obey new OPEC quotas and Saddam's promise Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he would not invade lulled Arab world sense crisis was over. Homage cause Arab unity has been paramount Middle East politics postwar independence colonial powers. Although civil war Yemen 1960s brought Egyptian and Saudi Arabian intervention opposing sides, no Arab state has ever directly deposed government fellow Arab League member. Despite Iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate Kuwait, it has long coveted tiny emirate. The Iraqi government refused recognize its independence 1961 and threatened attack then, backed when Britain landed troops Kuwait. The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors Gulf. It proved decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait was toothless. The GCC not issue statement, much less implement its mutual defense treaty. While Iraq was unlikely invade Saudi Arabia, it could use precedent Kuwait browbeat its neighbors local policy issues. Bombing oil field would be sufficient reminder what happened Kuwait when it balked Iraqi demands. Also region entirely ruled absolute monarchs, fall one makes rest feel extremely vulnerable. In series bellicose statements recent months, Saddam has sought focus domestic attention Iraq. In March he threatened burn half Israel Iraq's chemical weapons  banned international law  if Iraq was attacked. It was popular stance Arabs frustrated lack progress peace and Palestinian nation Arab-Israeli conflict. Then Britain arrested several people charges they were smuggling nuclear triggers Baghdad. Weeks later, police Europe impounded what they said was parts supergun capable firing chemical or nuclear shells Israel. Saddam cried foul, claiming West was trying wreck scientific progress Arabs. Saddam has sought inherit mantle late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nassar leader Arab world. His relentless personality cult has dubbed him The Knight Arabs. For Kuwait Thursday, he was dark knight. Asked reason invasion, Kuwait's ambassador Washington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said news conference: Ambition. Hegemony. Control whole area. There is not any reason it. Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators embraced warmly Tuesday they began talks their oil and border dispute, sources said. Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed 100,000 troops Kuwait's border.

The mediators have succeeded toning vitriolic campaign Kuwait Iraqi state-run media. On Tuesday, Iraqi delegation left Baghdad any public announcement. The leading Al-Thawra daily newspaper called Jiddah meeting opportunity ... Kuwait ... perceive Iraq's demands and respond its rights. In contrast, Kuwaiti delegation left Jiddah fanfare and publicity. The Kuwaiti papers said they hoped Jiddah meeting was start final just settlement differences Iraq and Kuwait, manner ensuring legitimate rights each.

Sixty-three percent of TV viewers watched the lopsided game which also featured the conclusion of the ""Bud Bowl II,"" a $7 million Anheuser Bush ad campaign. Though the game can spotlight a community's problems, it also has tremendous economic impact. Communities such as Los Angeles--Orange County, therefore, offer incentives, such as rent-free stadium use, to lure the game to their city. Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

And 1,200 interviews and 6{ years,the dream was Goldman, his mythic view Lennon Greataltered.Expecting best, Goldman claims have uncovered worst:a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved Howard Hughes ofrock 'n' roll, tucked his Dakota bed days time.That vision ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters,family and friends and prompted charges fiction writing; it alsotaught Goldman  who says he is John Lennon fan  hard lesson.It doesn't pay meet your idols. Just enjoy them; don't tryto see reality, Goldman said. My books are cold dose ofreality.

Most best-selling pop biographers play it safe: They choose celeb respectable, not say pristine, reputation, and then they proceed blacken it, preferably recounting vaguely sourced tales sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealings, even, some cases, dyslexia. The resulting portrait dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented hardback form public, which turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself buy biography millions. A can't-miss formula, surely. Albert Goldman's previous victim genre was Elvis Presley. Now Mr. Presley was, if you'll forgive expression, fat target writer Mr. Goldman's methods. His title notwithstanding, ""King Rock 'n' Roll"" was truth more creature old show biz, star whose wholesome image, carefully created P.R. wizards, was ripe debunking. But choosing Mr. Lennon his next target, Mr. Goldman appears be trying debunk undebunkable. For apart his puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic thousands interviews he gave was his squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy employees, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on. By his accounting, then, Mr. Lennon was not dethrone Ward Cleaver all-American dad. His public loved him spite it all -- or perhaps because it all. Mr. Lennon grew celebrity time when such transgressions intemperance and adultery (quaint terms!) were losing their social sting. His candor -- if that's what it was, and not simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything. And so it is grounds insufficient candor that resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot debunk, attacks his subject. The leitmotif Mr. Lennon's confessions was that his worst days were him, and that Yoko Ono he had last learned prize virtues quietude and domesticity. Now Mr. Goldman is here announce: He didn't tell you half it. Hence this 718-page stew unrelieved sordidness, percolating ""scoops"" that have now been widely publicized People magazine, ""West 57th"" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had thing young boys; that his marriage Ms. Ono was pocked same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit. The squalid revelations dribble out chemical leak, sliming every page. Remarkably, then, sleazemonger's art has triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon is worse John Lennon's John Lennon. A great deal this muck manages splash Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portrays cynical manipulator whose major talent lay exploiting Mr. Lennon further her craving fame and wealth. Mr. Goldman, alas, allows pass unremarked obvious irony that this is rather fine thumbnail sketch himself well. The keepers Lennon flame have course been quick point this out. Ms. Ono and her son have taken path preferred offended celebrities, they have hit talk shows display their wounds. And Rolling Stone magazine, long house organ Lennon publicity machine, recently published extensive rebuttal book, which was undercut tone priggish indignation bordering comic. Criticizing ""The Lives John Lennon"" insufficient respect fallen Beatle's legacy is rather point -- condemning Charles Manson his bad table manners. The book may indeed be inaccurate, critics have charged. But one can only hope that quibbles its veracity do not obscure countless other reasons hate Mr. Goldman's book. There is, starters, sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman is sort writer who refers pop songs ""pieces,"" though they were concerti. There is his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- drugs, sex, music -- that gives him license second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. And there is awkward organization, which minor events assume large proportions simple reason that they reflect badly Mr. Lennon, while major events are skipped lightly because -- there goes advance! -- they might reveal Mr. Lennon flattering light. All which indicates why ""The Lives John Lennon"" is such wretched book: not because it makes good man look bad, because it shows no other purpose make man -- whether good man or bad one, we laymen will probably never know -- look bad. John Lennon, while he was alive, enough that himself satisfy all lowest appetites. ---Mr. Ferguson is assistant managing editor The American Spectator.At this point, Lennon says he became househusband theirchild while Yoko ran family business.

Phone and electric service city command postwas knocked out.During it all, Riley kept close contact NationalWeather Service. As eye storm passed, he took reportersonto porch 188-year-old brick City Hall look thedamage.The initial view, sketched out glow flashlights, wasunsettling: The tin roof was tossed gutter, slate tiles werescattered ground. Bricks, sticks and leaves littered thestreet.This is eye hurricane. I've never been one and Ihope I'm never one again, Riley said. It's scarcely latesummer breeze.As storm died dawn, Riley was out streets againin raincoat carrying flashlight get better assessment ofthe damage.Serious fixable, mayor concluded.Damage Hurricane Hugo, which stormed Carolinas and Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings several insurers. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related Hugo reduce pretax earnings $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover first $35 million losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover bulk remaining damages. AIG insured property Puerto Rico, eastern Caribbean Islands and coastal regions Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based St. Paul, Minn, said pretax cost Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount takes consideration what St. Paul expects recover its reinsurance contracts, company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected disclose Hugo's likely impact its earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, insurance industry analyst Shearson Lehman Hutton New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced 50 cents and 65 cents share after-tax basis.

When damages North Carolina and Virginia are added, company said, payments will exceed $500 million. It said that is more three times previous record $165 million set Hurricane Alicia, which hit Houston-Galveston, Texas, area 1983.Supercomputers, satellites and expertise ofseveral hurricane forecasters predicted destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty time fleethe South Carolina coast.But hurricane tracking remains uncertain science.Forecasters National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path Charleston, S.C.All world's knowledge meteorological conditions andforecasting changes those conditions is embodied thosemodels, said Thomas Pyke, head National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.Pinpointing exact point Hugo's landfall was difficult, butforecasters said Friday that landfall was predicted time forevacuation.Overall, I think tracking models gave us very good ideawhere Hugo would be so officials South Carolina could act atimely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem Hugo was predicting theintensity storm, which was upgraded Category 4 hurricanejust hours it slammed Charleston.It is very difficult predict changes intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer models that, McAdie said.We really need improve our forecasting ability strength.The hurricane specialists were surprised last-minuteincrease wind speed, which was reported them Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes 35years, said that couple decades ago, only forecasting toolswere reports aircraft or ships.We had no radar or satellites then, so needless say ourforecasts were less accurate, Clark said.In late 1960s, weather service began using satellites toobtain global weather picture. Information satellite isused improve accuracy large-scale models thattelevision viewers see every night.Using information satellite, supercomputers theNational Meteorological Center Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where tracking model constantly changes toaccount current weather conditions and position thehurricane.To determine track storm, forecasters analyzesupercomputer predictions, satellite data, history similarstorms and current path hurricane.Then they make educated guess landfall.Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel MassachussettsInstitute Technology criticizes current forecasting system.Congress and American people are suffering thecollective delusion that our data problems have been solved bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give pretty picture, he said, not enoughinformation wind and temperatures that affect ahurricane's path.Most information actually used predict hurricanescomes flying airplanes hurricane, and they do verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say accuracy satellite pictures is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have remember that those models used are only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately job theforecaster predict storm's path.Residents took forecasters their wordwhen they warned Hurricane Hugo's fury, and low number ofdeaths powerful storm can be credited this healthyrespect, authorities said.The storm, which caused billions damage, claimed 17 lives inSouth Carolina, and only two were Charleston area, whichbore brunt Hugo's 135 mph winds.We just feel very thankful that, said Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousands people who were sheltersand tens thousands people who evacuated inland werepotential victims injury and death.Riley and other officials credited residents monitoring thehurricane it spun Charleston, and heeding evacuationwarnings.The last big storm hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in1979, which hit coast pounding southern Florida.Since then several big storms have threatened veered away,and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've had so many close calls, said Gary Garnet, ameteorologist National Weather Service.But this storm was very, very strong, he said. This timethey realized it.Glen Ellis, Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000residents Charleston and three surrounding counties headedfor shelters.Tens thousands more got their cars and headed upInterstate 26 Columbia.Mayor John Bourne North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related deaths, credited people heeding thewarnings.It was bad, it could have been lot worse, he said.You've just got say nice things people.Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news storm-wearyCharlestonians: late Saturday tropics were quiet no otherstorms brewing.There's nothing worry out there, he said.Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday thousands coastal residents insoutheastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.This is disaster staring us right eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. said his City Hall command post Charleston,where hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and causedutility transformers explode.All we can do now is pray and hope all precautions we havetaken have been sufficient, Riley said Hugo's eye bore onthe city.

Riley Jr.Hugo was first major hurricane strike Charleston sinceHurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles south 1959.The seaside community has suffered many disasters, bothnatural and man-made.The worst recent decades was 1938 when tornado torethrough city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causingan estimated $2 million property damage.Charleston, city pastel-colored antebellum structures liningquaint streets and alleyways, is where Civil War began 1861.The city has survived shot and shell two wars and anynumber smaller hurricanes, politely referred Charlestoniansof refinement September gales.But worst natural disaster beset city occurred thehot night Aug. 31, 1886, when ground rumbled what somefolks thought was prelude Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake was felt far away Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 Richter scale ground motion, theearthquake claimed estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildingsand tossed most city's 14,000 chimneys streets.In recent years, city has attracted millions visitorsannually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby finesand beaches.Charleston has received international acclaim home SpoletoFestival U.S.A., founded composer Gian Carlo Menotti.

The property claims service division American Insurance Service Group, trade association, is expected announce its estimate total insured losses tomorrow. ""Hugo will be biggest hurricane loss record,"" said one official, far surpassing $752.5 million insurers paid out Frederick ripped several Gulf Coast states 1979. The impact premium rates could be minimal now, analysts expect, because biggest losses will be personal insurance area -- homes and autos. Most companies typically set aside funds premiums they collect every year cover claims they might have pay future. In last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers haven't had dip these funds. And Hugo also stormed Caribbean, foreign insurers are risk some damage those islands. Yet, some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make dent industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely slash premium rates further coming months. Rates have been falling late 1986. Udayan Ghose Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believes these reasons might cause rates edge higher mid-1990. For time being, losses Hugo ""will be substantial, they won't be something industry can't handle,"" said Charles L. Ruoff, director strategic planning Fred S. James & Co., New York-based insurance broker. For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimates it will pay claims totaling more $400 million homeowners and some small businesses. Nationwide Insurance Co., mutual company based Columbus, Ohio, said Hugo ""is single largest claims disaster"" it has seen its 63-year history. The company, which is largest home and auto insurer North Carolina and No. 3 South Carolina, has already received 16,000 claims stricken region. Claims could total $100 million, spokesman said. For some insurers, Hugo was double-whammy. New York-based Continental Corp., which is big insurer Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, said it will take $50 million pretax charge earnings this quarter, reflecting its net exposure damages caused hurricane. ""Hugo will be particularly costly us,"" said John P. Mascotte, Continental's chairman. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which has extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations areas Hugo hit, and USF&G Corp. Baltimore, big insurer Carolina region, could also be forced take one-time charges third-quarter earnings, analysts said. Some USF&G's losses hit very close home -- its Charleston office was destroyed hurricane. Both USF&G and Cigna declined predict whether they would take charge; USF&G said it would be responsible first $22.5 million losses, and its reinsurance would cover bulk additional losses. Hugo could have marginal impact third-quarter income Travelers Corp., Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., according industry analysts. Mr. Ruoff Fred S. James believes that if losses Hugo total much $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough ""financial pain, such not being able pay shareholder dividends,"" compel them boost premium rates right away. He explained that first six months this year, net income industry declined slightly 1988, insurance companies were still earning adequate rate return equity. He also noted that industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently $125 billion, is also plentiful. Generally, insurers can book $3 premiums every $1 surplus. Right now, premiums total $200 billion, he said. An official Nationwide Insurance noted that company has $1 surplus every $2 insurance that it writes. Insurers also buy protection themselves reinsurance paying another company portion premium bear some losses. Michael Lewis Dean Witter Reynolds said losses Hugo could be big enough ""temporarily"" increase reinsurance rates. Although reinsurance will limit exposure some companies, losses they must still cover could hurt third-quarter results. Niagara Exchange Corp., based Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report loss operations third quarter, and possibly year, because substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit faces result hurricane. State Farm, nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance. It believes its reserves are plentiful enough absorb its losses, spokesman said.","AP890922-0119,WSJ890928-0084,AP890922-0167,AP890925-0054,LA092189-0225,AP890922-0007,LA092789-0093,AP890928-0099,AP890922-0049,WSJ890927-0018","South Carolina Coast Evacuation Before ""Killer Storm"" Hugo Saves Lives","The insurance industry expects Hugo, the Category 4 hurricane that struck the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, to be the costliest storm ever.

Though there was significant damage, only two were killed in Charleston, 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who heeded Hurricane Center warnings and evacuated before the storm's arrival.Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.","American Insurance Service Group says Hurricane Hugo, which ravaged the Caribbean and the Carolinas last week, is responsible for record hurricane losses. State Farm Insurance expects claims of approximately $500 million in the Carolinas. Nationwide Insurance is projecting claims near $100 million.

Some companies, however, will reduce third-quarter earnings.Hugo slammed into Charleston Thursday night with top winds of 135 mph. Upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane hours before it struck the historic city, it caused widespread damage throughout the Carolinas. Only two lives were lost in Charleston, however, and only 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who monitored the hurricane and evacuated.  Computer models at the National Hurricane Center used satellite information to track Hugo's path into Charleston.

Thousands fled inland or went to shelters.Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.",Forecasters Saved Lives During Deadly Hurricane Hugo,"Hurricane Hugo which hit Charleston, S.C. head-on the night of Sept. 21, 1989 was the costliest storm in the city's 300-year history. Despite widespread devastation (insured losses approached $5 billion) there were only 17 deaths in South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself thanks to accurate forecasting in time for an effective evacuation.","On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, South Carolina head-on with winds at 135 mph causing extensive property damage, but claiming only 17 lives in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself. The relatively low casualties were a result of an accurate prediction of the point of windfall by hurricane forecasters, effective evacuation measures and good response from residents. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion, by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area, but insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims.","Hurricane Hugo approached the Carolina coast on Sept. 21, 1989 with its windspeed up to 125 mph and threatened to hit between Savannah, GA and Charleston, S.C. It hit Charleston head-on with winds of 135 mph and then proceeded northwestward hitting other population centers rather than heading up the coast or out to sea as expected. Fortunately Hurricane forecasters analyzing computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane made an accurate educated guess as to the point of landfall in time for threatened residents to evacuate. As a result, only 17 deaths resulted in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston which took the brunt of the storm. Charleston had been through many hard times in its 300- year history, but Hugo was by far the worst hurricane in its experience. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion but insurers were confident that they could handle all claims. Disaster aid came to Charleston from an unexpected source. Kingston, New York  raised funds to aid Charleston in thanks for 1,000 New York pounds sent by the South Carolina governor in 1778 to help the citizens of Kingston after it was burned by the British.",,,,

Jim Boling.Divers worked where two creeks empty Ohio.Four bodies were found Sunday. But two those were notimmediately identified, and list missing was not revised toaccount them.The number missing dropped 16 other two bodies andthe removal two other names: woman who called say she wassafe and person who authorities weren't sure lived area,said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.The 20th victim was pulled mouth Pipe Creek theOhio River, seven miles south Shadyside, Vogt said.Another body was found debris Wegee Creek, and two bodieswere found earlier Ohio, he said.That brought confirmed death toll Thursday's floods to20, including five children.Twenty-three dog teams four states were searching forvictims, said Boling. The digging will continue least throughTuesday, said Fire Chief Mark Badia.The thing you find once you start these brush piles andpiles trees are cars, and they have be torn apart andsearched separately, Badia said. Everything you turn createsa different situation.But Vogt said he doubted many missing would be foundalive.It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody aliveout there, he said. You can't swim out there that long theOhio River.The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night duringstorms that poured 5{ inches rain eastern Ohio 3{ hours.The floods destroyed many 70 houses and damaged 40others.Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some ofthose were later found dead, while notified authorities thatthey were safe.Officials also learned that some those feared missing hadmoved out area. Officials were comparing county propertylists and data Census Bureau information fromresidents and relatives, Boling said.Investigators Sunday blamed flash floods unusuallyheavy rainstorm that overwhelmed designed flow capacities ofthreebridges creeks. Badia said rainwater running downhillsides forced debris creeks, forming dams eachbridge. The dams broke water pressure.Eventually bridges couldn't hold any more. The debrisbroke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes water, hesaid.As rescue efforts continued, National Guard cleared roadsand bridges leading stricken area.Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areassince tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.Across border West Virginia, Gov.

Heavy rain fell forabout 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one two creeks thatoverflowed Thursday night's flash flood.By midmorning, muddy creek was nearly crossing road aboutthree miles upstream where floods inflicted mostdamage. Lt. Dean Irvin Ohio Army National Guard said therewere no immediate reports additional property damage.The body found this morning was Ohio River nearMoundsville, W.Va., 10 miles south Shadyside, according toChuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.The number names list missing dropped 18 14with identities three victims and call one personalerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said. One therecovered bodies remains unidentified. Authorities are not rulingout possibility that other people not list could bemissing.Four bodies were recovered Sunday.Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some thoselater were found dead, while notified authorities that theywere safe and officials learned that still more had moved out ofthe area.Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed storms that dumped 5{inches rain 3{ hours. The floods destroyed many 70houses and damaged 40 others.Most those whose homes and belongings were swept away thewall water will have put their lives back together largelywithout benefit insurance.Few people coal-mining and steel-making area carriedflood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damagefrom Thursday's flood, residents and insurers said.We didn't think we needed have flood insurance. For what?That creek never flooded. Then this. Everybody just got wipedout, said Julia Kulazenka.Rainwater running hillsides had forced debris thecreeks and formed dams bridges spanning them, Shadyside FireChief Mark Badia said.Eventually bridges couldn't hold any more. The debrisbroke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes water,Badia said.The home Mrs. Kulazenka shared her husband his deathlast July was damaged Wegee Creek raged out control. She saidreplacing machine shop, garage, deck and automobiles she and herson owned would cost more $80,000.They told us homeowners' won't do us no good. So unless thegovernment helps us rebuild, I don't know what I'll do thisplace, Mrs. Kulazenka said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open anoffice Tuesday Shadyside accept applications residentsfor low-interest loans and grants help them rebuild.Before flood, land Wegee Creek valley fetchedhandsome prices, said Kulazenka's son, Charles Kulazenka. That wasespecially welcome residents, many whom were either retiredor laid jobs coal mines Belmont County, whereunemployment April was 6.8 percent.Ground was premium here this because it wasjust city limits (of Shadyside). It was quiet andpeaceful and people were looking buy and build new homes outhere.

Look light created14 billion years ago and arriving your eye only this instant.Ride beginning everything, almost, BigBang 10 or 20 thousand million years ago. See stars born and seethem die. Watch galaxies form. Follow flow gas theMilky Way's halo. Peer deep universe, so many starsin our galaxy that it would take person more lifetimeto count, hundred billion other galaxies each 200billion stars.For scientists, and then rest us, all that becomespossible now that space shuttle Discovery has carried theHubble Space Telescope sky see what no one has seenbefore. The telescope, silvery tube long tanker truck,has unmatched ability detect and capture faintest light.Light, speeding 186,000 miles second, is themessenger creation. Tracking trail light today tothe first moments contains all information we will ever haveabout creation universe.The Hubble promises give science open window perhaps tothe first echoes creation. This is world-class event, ifastronomy is not your thing.Superlatives?In history optical astronomy there have been two greatleaps resolution universe: Galileo's telescope theautumn 1609, and Hubble Space Telescope April 1990. Eric J. Chaisson, senior scientist Space Telescope ScienceInstitute Baltimore.One more?No one ever made anything that good, James Westphal,California Institute Technology.Another?Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that theHubble telescope will literally be dawn new era inastronomy.Eras rarely can be proclaimed advance. But HST, namedafter Edwin Powell Hubble, holds that kind promise.Hubble was astronomer first half century whoconcluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away Earthbut that farther away they are, faster they move. Thetheory expanding universe supported belief that theuniverse originated cosmic explosion and that all matter isstill rushing site that so-called Big Bang.Astronomers think Big Bang occurred 12 billion 20 billionyears ago and sent entire universe flying out incrediblespeed and heat. Eventually matter cooled and condensed intogalaxies, stars and planets.There are bigger telescopes Hubble, they are all onEarth and all subject major limitation  atmosphere which is fine breathing lousy seeing through. Theproblem skywatching layers air has been likened tobirdwatching bottom swimming pool.The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing views ofEarth's sister planets, had travel 12 years get close enoughfor pictures they whizzed past. With Hubble, says scientistEdward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want.The telescope is 42.5 14 feet and consists 94.5-inchprimary mirror that gathers incoming light.On clear, dark night you can see flashlight two milesaway, says Weiler, chief NASA scientist Hubble project.With 28-power telescope you can see it moon 250,000miles away. With HST you could see firefly Australia fromWashington.Ground controllers GoddardSpace Flight Center finally made contact today two mainantennas $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope tryingfor more six hours lock on.Applause erupted Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md.,as glitch that marred Hubble's first full day space wassolved.We have confirmation that we have achieved communication withthe Tracking and Data Relay Satellite high-gain antennasystem, said NASA's Dave Drachlis.Engineers had said all they believed antennas wereworking all right and that problem was incorrectly pointingeither satellite or TDRS, orbiting communicationssatellite that acts switchboard.In successful attempt, they nearly doubled width theantennas' beams take more territory, sweep 6.2degrees 10.8 degrees.The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmitinformation much slower rate and can be used emergencies,were working well.Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available remedycertain problems. The outage was not problem which spacewalkers would have been summoned.The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures ofstorms Texas their 380-mile-high perch, and doingexperiments.Steve Terry, director team calibrating various aspects ofthe telescope, said first outage was caused human error andwas not serious problem. It began 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT andlasted 45 minutes hour, he said.The second failure occurred 6:44 a.m. when controllersattempted send signal telescope's two high-gainantennas TDRS.This time it was pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, aGoddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft and we thinkinexperience dealing it was cause.The telescope, embarking 15-year search new worlds, wasreleased shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minutesnag that almost sent two astronauts emergency spacewalk.Mission Control awakened crew early today loudrendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite.Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake thatsong, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are alot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday andHubble had good night while you were asleep.We appreciate good words everybody, repliedDiscovery Commander Loren Shriver.After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discoveryaway telescope and put shuttle series ofmaneuvers, last one completed this morning, parkDiscovery orbit 46 miles Hubble.The telescope really looked great we flew away it, andwe sure hope it does good work, Shriver said Wednesday.Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks all great workyou've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud ofyou.Scientists have hailed Hubble  NASA's most expensiveunmanned spacecraft  greatest advance astronomy sinceGalileo raised small telescope his eyes nearly 400 years ago.Discovery and its five astronauts will follow telescopewhile controllers Goddard center make sure Hubble isoperating properly, such responding directional commands.The next milestone is Friday, when telescope's 10-footaperture door is be opened, exposing finely polished94.5-inch mirror starlight.Then Tuesday, NASA expects release first image fromthe telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina.Data will follow month or two.If aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery couldreturn telescope so two astronauts could perform spacewalkto fix it.Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said telescope would betested today its ability maneuver aperture dooris opened.We want be full control so we don't ever endanger theHubble putting aperture door close sunlight, hesaid. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitiveinstruments.On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used shuttle's50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope and hoistit cargo bay.One telescope's solar arrays unreeled its mast asexpected and started providing power telescope's batteries,which otherwise had only eight hours charge.But there was trouble second panel. It wouldn't budgewhen latches were released, and then moved fifth its39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all way outon third attempt.By final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and KathrynSullivan were their space suits airlock, 30 minutes awayfrom taking tools hand and going outer-space maintenancecall.Wojtalik said cause problem is unknown.The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles Earth, 70miles higher any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit wasdictated need put Hubble Earth's distortingatmosphere.Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost thebeginning time, studying stars and galaxies so distant theirlight has taken 14 billions years reach Earth. They hope todetermine how and when universe was formed, currently estimatedat 15 billion years ago.The telescope originally was scheduled launch 1983 butwas delayed technical problems and Challenger accident.Discovery, which blasted orbit Tuesday, is scheduled toland Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.Five astronauts boarded Discoverytoday second try sending Hubble Space Telescope intoorbit scan outermost reaches universe clues tothe beginning time.Astronomers are starting tingle again anticipation ofwhat Hubble will be able accomplish, said Lennard Fisk,head NASA science activities.Air Force forecasters said there was 90 percent chance theweather would be favorable launching shuttle thescheduled time 8:31 a.m. EDT.More half million gallons liquid hydrogen and liquidoxygen were pumped space ship's fuel tanks midnight.The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed intothe crew cabin just dawn was breaking Kennedy SpaceCenter.The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will giveastronomers new set eyes and ears that we don't have, saidWilliam Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program.It's going change our perspective altogether. I can't saywhat we're going learn, I'll be astounded if we don't learnmany new things.Discovery was aiming altitude 380 miles, highest ashuttle has ever gone, so telescope can be placed its properorbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is 35thshuttle mission.Columbia, which journeys space next month Astroobservatory, sat launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery, only thesecond time pads have been occupied; first was 1986just Challenger explosion.Hubble has been waiting take its place space 1983,delayed technical problems and Challenger accident. Thelatest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch wasscrubbed four minutes liftoff because faulty power uniton shuttle.The mood Kennedy Space Center was considerably lessfestive first launch attempt, when hundreds ofastronomers gathered their families.The day launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley willuse shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescopeinto space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and KathrynSullivan will assist if problem develops.Discovery will follow Hubble 40 miles away two daysuntil its lens cap is opened, exposing finely polished94.5-inch mirror starlight.Hubble is not expected start providing scientific data bysatellite month or more liftoff. However, NASA said itwill release its first image  open star cluster theconstellation Carina  week launch.In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million hasbeen spent spare parts, astronaut training and computer softwareto operate instrument. The European Space Agency contributed$250 million 15 percent viewing time.NASA estimates it will cost $200 million year operate andmaintain telescope space.During its 15-year working lifetime, telescope will provideastronomers 10 times better resolution and 25 times moresensitivity ground-based observatories. As result, they willbe able study stars and galaxies so distant their light has beentraveling Earth 14 billion years.Astronomers hope learn whether universe was created 15billion years ago believed and uncover some mysterysurrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also isexpected shed light how and when universe might end.The telescope is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,who discovered 1920s that universe is expanding. Hiswork gave rise Big Bang theory that universe was createdby tremendous explosion.In addition Hubble, Discovery carries human skull filledwith sensors measure space radiation that astronautsreceive. It is skull's third trip space.The shuttle is end its five-day mission landing atEdwards Air Force Base, Calif.Seven years late, Hubble SpaceTelescope is where it belongs, out this world and search ofothers so distant that they may have been formed beginningof time.Less five hours it rode space shuttleDiscovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope sent its firsttest radio signal. At sign life, applause and cheers eruptedin Mission Control Houston.As we can tell, everything looks perfect, saidastronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesdaywill be drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space.Discovery, trailing arc white smoke brilliant bluesky, carried silver-colored telescope orbit 380 milesabove Earth  higher 70 miles any previous shuttle. Therethe Hubble will stay search yet-unseen wonders creationwith instruments that can look 14 billion years backward time.Our window universe! NASA launch commentator GeorgeDiller exulted Discovery rose its seaside launch pad.It's beautiful day have Hubble Space Telescope orbitinstead here Earth it's been so many years, saidNASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's its element and I'mdelighted.The telescope was supposed be launched 1983, technicalproblems and Challenger accident delayed its deployment. Itsuffered further delay two weeks ago when countdown wasstopped four-minutes-to-go point because faultyhydraulic unit shuttle.While it remained Earth, telescope cost $7 million amonth exercise and keep readiness. In its first day space,that checkout and testing continued remotely control theGoddard Space Flight Center Maryland.On hand watch Discovery launching was contingent ofscientists who have hailed Hubble greatest advance inastronomy Galileo raised small telescope his eyes nearly400 years ago.Truly referred early-day astronomer when he was askedabout long delays getting telescope its workingstation.Somebody other day said, `Who remembers day thatGalileo picked his telescope look stars?' saidTruly, former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day welaunch Hubble, it matters that we do it right.The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet diameter, thesize railroad tank car. When it flies free, it will receiveelectrical power its six scientific instruments twowing-like solar arrays that extend outward each side.It is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whotheorized that universe was expanding and that farther awaya galaxy is, faster it is traveling. That gave support thetheory that massive explosion  Big Bang  created theuniverse 10 20 billion years ago.The Hubble is expected help provide answer two majorquestions: How old is universe? How big is it?The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches diameter, theother 12 inches. Two instruments are cameras, two arespectrometers and one is photometer. In addition, finepointing system acts sixth instrument providing precisemeasurement distances.On Wednesday, Hawley is grapple 12{-ton telescope withthe shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out cargo bay, pointit, and  long checkout  drop it overboard orbit itsown.In cargo bay, telescope receives electrical power fromthe shuttle. But juice is cut when instrument is lifted outand it will depend internal batteries solar panels areextended receive light sun.Should solar panels not deploy, mission specialists BruceMcCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partiallydressed space suits, ready go open cargo bay tounfurl arrays manually.Discovery's launch was not its problems.With 31 seconds left countdown, computer that runsthe final moments liftoff refused close fuel valve andstopped launch process. The problem was overcome and theshuttle lifted 8:34 a.m. EDT, three minutes late.The shuttle is scheduled land Sunday 9:49 a.m. EDT atEdwards Air Force Base California.On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, theshuttle's windshield was splattered several flecks ofthings. He said windshield was streaked debris andthat it also was smeared when spent booster rockets fell offduring climb orbit.The astronauts also had problems their UHF radio circuit,and one ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative. Neitherproblem was considered serious.Discovery's astronauts overcamebalky equipment send Hubble Space Telescope floating freefrom shuttle today 15-year quest secrets theuniverse.The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3minutes altitude 380 miles  high atmosphere,which has limited view ground-based telecopes.Discovery, go Hubble release, Mission Control told thecrew 3:37 p.m. EDT. The event occurred minute later theshuttle slowly and carefully backed away.The final hours its release were nightmare groundcontrollers they commanded unfurling two solar panelsthat power telescope's instruments.The starboard panel balked twice it was being pulled itsreel. Mission Control ordered space-walking astronauts be readyto go out cabin help. But there was third try and itwas successful.We have confirmation that solar array wing thestarboard side has been deployed, telescope control center inMaryland said.So we have good news, said Dave Drachlis, Hubblecontrol center.The deployment two 39-foot panels allowed sun power toflow telescope's batteries, relieving worries that theywould use their eight-hour charge.Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able lift 12{-tontelescope cargo bay shuttle's mechanical arm, itsinstruments had be disconnected shuttle's power andshifted batteries.Precisely one day lifting Launch Pad 39B atKennedy Space Center, Hubble Space Telescope is ready fly onits own, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The game hasbegun. The race is on. The clock is ticking.Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put onspacesuits and entered airlock order be ready walkoutside and pull out array had mechanical deployment thesolar panels failed.Cameras Discovery showed telescope, being held theend 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight its silver surfaceand turning Earth background.Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shrivermaneuvered shuttle its deployment position, its nosepointed sun. That was put telescope's solararrays, once unfurled, proper angle quickly startcollecting energy and protect telescope's fixed star trackerswhile instrument was being held payload bay.Discovery is orbit 380 miles Earth, 70 miles higherthan any previous shuttle. The orbit was dictated need toput telescope Earth's distorting atmosphere.For those technically inclined this morning, I'd passon quote day on-board astronomer (Hawley),something effect that big marble sure looks far awaytoday, Shriver said.The five astronauts' busy day began musical note early thismorning Mission Control played song called Space is OurWorld, written members Discovery's training team and aHouston-area group, Private Numbers.Controllers monitoring telescope Goddard Space FlightCenter Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detectedso far Hubble, most expensive and complex unmannedspacecraft ever built.Everything has just being going clockwork, said RonSchlagheck, shift director orbital verifications Goddard.Everybody is excellent spirits.The Hubble telescope, delayed technical problems and 1986Challenger accident, has waited seven years take its place inspace. It finally got ride orbit Tuesday morning aboardDiscovery.Hubble will allow astronomers study stars and galaxies sodistant their light has taken 14 billion years reach Earth. Itis expected provide clues age and size universe,and it may solve mysteries quasars, pulsars and black holesand find stars planets that could conceivably supportlife.The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet indiameter, size railroad tank car. When it is inorbit, it will receive electrical power its six scientificinstruments two winglike solar arrays.It is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whosediscovery 1920s that universe is expanding gave riseto Big Bang theory that universe was created atremendous explosion 10 billion 20 billion years ago.The Hubble Space Telescope wasawakened its self-induced sleep today it was still withoutthe use its high-speed antennas, and its science instrumentswere hold, unable begin any observations.We are out `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, asupervisor engineers controlling telescope. He said thetelescope was running normal control-all mode, where itsown computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear areturn Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations Earthand talked ground-based reporters their flight.Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat thewidespread public awareness telescope, which is expectedeventually look back 14 billion light years  nearly thebirth universe.It's hard go somewhere and find someone who has never heardof Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It makes littlekids' eyes light up.

The antennas are primary links relayingscientific data ground.Terry said that safe mode, one tape recordersin telescope reads telemetry signals all its systems andthat these would be played Earth and analyzed when antennasare working properly.We expect use that data investigate what happened, hesaid. Engineers are able send commands telescope itssecondary antennas communications system is not useful forscientific data, which must be transmitted high rate speed.We're putting scientific instruments hold mode, ineffect standby mode, he said.Shortly 6 a.m. EDT, controllers Goddard SpaceFlight Center Greenbelt, Md., completed series commandsthat took telescope out its safe mode and then began runa 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health.It will take another day $1.5 billion telescope isoperating way it was supposed this point startupprocess, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.We're backing very deliberate and slow and carefulapproach these problems, Olivier said Friday. This is notthe time do anything dumb.The telescope problems have put flight center several daysbehind, five astronauts who deployed it earlier this weekwere sticking their schedule.Landing is scheduled 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday Edwards AirForce Base, Calif., flight controllers were keeping closewatch weather.Winds were predicted be 20 mph gusts 29 mph.Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph attouchdown.The shuttle carries enough supplies stay orbit three daysbeyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.Mission Control awakened crew members 1:30 a.m. EDTtoday playing song, Cosmos.Thanks wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate fortoday, said Commander Loren Shriver.The song was selected honor Hubble Space Telescope,which is now open business, said Mission Control commentatorJames Hartsfield.The astronauts were finish their experiments andphotography today and pack trip home. They also planned tohold news conference space reporters JohnsonSpace Center.Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were run series oftests make certain shuttle's computers and control jets wereready return Earth.The crew deployed Hubble Wednesday they had stayed closeto telescope case there was trouble opening aperturedoor. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivanwere prepared perform space walk today crank it open inorbit 380 miles Earth.But that proved unnecessary when door was opened Fridaymorning, exposing telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye tostarlight first time.Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stoppedworking when door opened, engineers later got them back online. The gyroscopes were knocked out motion and that, too,kept telescope safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, directorof orbital verifications Goddard.A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set atconservative limits first operations and that caused manymalfunctions. There also were two communications outages totalingseveral hours.Hubble is designed safe modes so it can be master ofits destiny case contact orbiting communicationssystem is lost extended periods, Terry said.NASA had planned release its first test image thetelescope Tuesday, showing open star cluster theconstellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed becauseof antenna problems. Scientific data will follow month ortwo.The telescope, named late astronomer Edwin P.

I'll betit's just that way back there, too, added mission specialistSteven Hawley. Who's buying tonight?We'll buy when you all get back, Musgrave replied.Flight director William Reeves said it was too early cheer.`We still have important part mission go, Reevessaid. We reserve our celebration crew is safely theground.Discovery is land 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday Edwards AirForce Base, Calif. Landing would have been delayed day ifastronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had performa space walk crank open telescope's lens cover, or aperturedoor.The shuttle trailed 50 miles Hubble when aperturedoor opened 380 miles Earth, passed 3.7 miles thetelescope later day.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned torelease its first test image $1.5 billion telescope onTuesday, showing open star cluster constellation Carina.But Steve Terry, director orbital verifications, said that wouldbe delayed problems Hubble's high-speed antennas.Scientific data will follow month or two.Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened theheavens 10:30 a.m. EDT, nearly four hours later planned,exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight thefirst time.Ground controllers sent signal commanding door lifteven though telescope was automatic safe mode, withall motion stopped because problems linking its high-speeddish antennas relay satellite.One two antennas apparently had swung too far, and thetelescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy projectmanager. If future movements antenna have be limited toavoid problem, it would have only slight impact thetelescope's observing time, Oliver said.Terry said opening aperture door could not have beendelayed much longer.There has be point where you say they have go theirway and we have go ours, he said astronauts.When door opened, two Hubble's four position-stabilizinggyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them back line.The motion lens cover knocked out gyros, said DaveDrachlis Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland. That, too,kept it safe mode.Oliver said it would be Saturday morning telescope isbrought out safe mode. It will take another day get theinstrument operating normally again, putting controllers Goddardseveral days behind.We're trying be very deliberate and trying not cut anycorners and do anything fast because we feel there's lot riskhere and we want make sure we're doing it properly, Oliversaid. We've got long future ahead us, and we want makesure it starts right foot.NASA said telescope was safe and stable position.Tolerances telescope systems were set particularlynarrow first operations and that was cause manymalfunctions, Terry said. In addition that trouble, there weretwo communications outages totaling several hours.We're cautious, and that's natural, Terry said.

The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,

Panfil won London Marathon 2:26:31, her personalbest, and won New York City Marathon 1990.TOMORROW evening, just Olympic closing ceremony, last and oneof most prestigious events Games will be held. It is also withoutdoubt most gruelling. Run high heat, high humidity, high pollutionlevels and extraordinary course, Barcelona Olympic men'smarathon will prove one most physically demanding ever run. There arelots figures show why. It is estimated that when race begins inMataro, seaside town north Barcelona, temperature will be analready-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards marathon's end, however, radiantheat thrown buildings could be subjecting runners atemperature 30`C. More debilitating still, relative humidity inBarcelona August rises high 80 cent. With more 10kilometres still go, most course is upward run. The last 4.6km,which take runners 60m higher still Olympic stadium top ofthe hill Montjuic, has average gradient more 4.5 cent, andincludes some sections 7 cent, equivalent skiing terms steep'red' run. But we do not need figures convince us extraordinarydifficulty tomorrow's race. Last Saturday, Olympic stadium, Iwatched final moments and aftermath women's marathon, begun atthe same time day and run similar conditions. Never any eventvoluntarily entered into, sporting or otherwise, have I seen such signs ofphysical and mental distress. The race was won Unified Team'sValentina Yegorova 2 hours 32 minutes, time considerably slower thanthat achieved women less demanding Olympic marathon courses LosAngeles and Seoul. After her nearest competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, camein eight seconds later, they had energy - bouts grimacing andlowering their heads their knees - embrace each other and smile forthe cameras.It was different story 'mixed zone,' area stadiumwhere athletes recover their events. As runner runner stumbledand limped room - several were brought senseless stretchers -the scene seemed be populated exhausted boat people rescued afterweeks exposure and deprivation sea.As photographer calmly shot roll film foot her face,Manuela Machado Mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently apotted palm. Several competitors lay prone and gasping ground aswater was poured them; stood hunched over, grasping theirabdomens.If anyone moved all, it was agonised faces and slowest ofhobbles. These are not sort scenes likely promote enthusiasm formarathon running or ideals Olympic competition.Chris Brasher, organiser London marathon, was hand witness thesuffering, and was incensed. Male marathon runners will face same kindof problems heat, humidity, and over-demanding terrain, he said.In his opinion, gearing marathon prime-time TV viewing and having theevent end top hill sake stadium spectators wasunjustified and 'sell-out commercialism.'To put marathon late afternoon, rather first thing inthe morning (the normal practice), and then make them run 4km hillis just criminal my opinion,' said Brasher, former Olympic gold medalathlete and noted sportswriter.I spoke Britain's Steve Brace, winner Paris marathon 1989 and1990, Berlin marathon last year and competitor Barcelona event.He agrees that run will be highly demanding, and while he regardsOlympic marathon running pinnacle his career, he is cautious abouttomorrow's slog.Like almost all athletes running tomorrow, Brace is professionalrunner who specialises marathons. He takes objective, long-term viewof his profession. As income-earner, marathon running is activity withliabilities and limitations, and requires business management well asphysical ability.The winner London marathon earns tidy Dollars 50,000 and NewYork, Boston and Japanese runs are all same prize-winning category.But these and less financially-rewarding events are physically debilitating,and can only be won if competitor is top physical shape.With their careers and financial prospects mind, top-level runnersnormally only run two marathons year. As Brace says, when you have onlytwo pay-days out 365, you choose, plan and train them greatcare.Brace trains extremely carefully indeed. 'Running marathon is easypart,' he says. 'The hard part is lead-up achieving performancelevel required.' He starts training three months event running80 miles week and then building progressively. For last six weeks heruns 120 miles week.Normally he would hope that such routine brings pay-off. But Olympicmarathon is exception: only top-level marathon that carries no prizemoney. Brace says that spite prestige and possible financialspin-offs involved, 'it does not necessarily make sense run win.'Given highly demanding nature course and their desire preservephysical condition races that do bring money, he says, many runnerswill give less their best effort.Nonetheless, there are plenty whose considerations stretch purelyfinancial. Italian Gelindo Bordin, who came first 1988 Seoul Olympicmarathon, is strong contender. So is Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who camethird Seoul. Ibrahim Hussein Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi Japan arealso possible winners.None them, though, will make molehill out steep and formidableascent Montjuic.A crowd size small city will squeeze starting line here March 1 run 26 miles, 385 yards. And cheering every step that distance will be more dozen corporate sponsors and licensees. Makers cars, soda pop, sportswear, copiers, computers -- hospital -- have tagged their names Los Angeles Marathon. In promoter's words, this run is ""a marketing event legs,"" reflecting marathoning's growing importance upscale product promotions. Runners, it seems, are well-heeled lot. A study Mercedes-Benz found that 42% family heads making $40,000 year or more jog regularly. Of potential buyers showing Mercedes dealers, 47% are joggers. With those numbers mind, car maker has become sponsor three marathons -- New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- well other running races. Marathons have had corporate backing some time. But Los Angeles is ahead pack making distance running commercial spectacle. The city that invented corporate-sponsored Olympics has created marathon -- artfully dressed Olympic-type amateur race, built ground make money closely held company that controls it -- well city. ""I took air and made event,"" says William Burke, founder and president Los Angeles Marathon Inc. For man whose running days ended his high school track team, Mr. Burke is turning lot heads world marathoning. Last year, its first time out, Los Angeles race attracted nearly 11,000 runners -- four times number forecast and enough make it third -- largest race U.S. The event also pulled $4 million cash and services its sponsors, leaving organizers $370,000 red ink. This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect gross $5 million cash and services and break even. Next year, they say, profit is possible. More 18,000 runners are expected this year. An audience perhaps million and half or more will line route, drawn part advertisements 75 million Coca-Cola cans and 2,500 billboards Los Angeles area. Marketing experts say festive atmosphere big crowds streets makes marathons attractive sponsors. For cost 30-second ad Super Bowl, company can sponsor marathon and ""take city,"" says Lesa Ukman, editor Special Events Reports, Chicago-based newsletter. The Los Angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps done more their counterparts elsewhere publicize event. Los Angelenos are seeing plugs race millions grocery bags, milk cartons and loaves bread, addition soda cans, billboards and other sources. The venerable New York Marathon is taking note. The New York Road Runners Club, organizer race, stopped promoting event some years ago because it had all runners it wanted. Now, Fred Lebow, group's president, says he is encouraging sponsors promote race Los Angeles sponsors do. The promotion Los Angeles is unabashed. ""We tell people that if they're looking new way crack Los Angeles market, this is it,"" says Mr. Burke. The pitch has attracted likes Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Los Angeles; Vons Cos., large supermarket chain; Los Angeles Times; Sears Savings Bank unit Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc. One supporter is Ellesse USA, sportswear and shoe producer. A $50,000 fee enables company use marathon's name its ads; Ellesse will spend additional $100,000 dressing race personnel T-shirts and warm-up suits, showing its clothes marathon's public ""Expo"" sponsors' wares, and posting dozen big street banners course. The company has rented more 500 billboards cut-rate price $120,000 Patrick Media Group, marathon sponsor. The discount, 50%, was important. ""We couldn't have bought that kind exposure normally,"" says Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director. Ellesse, which also sponsors New York run, finds West Coast event more freewheeling. ""They have let us do we want,"" says Ms. Cialone. For instance, product banners route -- almost impossible arrange New York -- are snap Los Angeles. The city, fact, is partner race. After competitive bidding, it awarded eight-year contract Los Angeles Marathon Inc. put race. The exclusive franchise calls race organizers this year pay minimum $60,000 fee or 4% gross cash receipts city. The organizers also will pay cost city services marathon, estimated $100,000. The race sponsors and city officials are trading freely good will generated Los Angeles's role host 1984 Olympics. The logo marathon is shield laurel wreath. Some posters show Los Angeles Coliseum its torch and giant Olympic symbol. ""The World Returns Los Angeles,"" proclaims one Mercedes-Benz ad. Race directors are called ""commissioners,"" term borrowed 1984 Olympic organization, which Mr. Burke was commissioner tennis. And Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portraying race civic celebration, thrives volunteers. Some 7,500 people will work free monitor course race day. And two-thirds race's office staff work pay. ""I couldn't buy this,"" Mr. Burke says, gesturing crowded race headquarters. Not everyone works free. Big-name runners, instance, want be paid lot. And here, organizers have pinched pennies. While some runners will be paid appear, this year's field, last year's, lacks some superstars who race Boston, New York and London. Grete Waitz, one best woman marathoners, wanted $100,000 appear Los Angeles; she was turned down. Mr. Burke says Australian runner Rob de Castella made it known his agent that he wouldn't run any marathons spring but, $25,000, he'd be happy say Los Angeles event was tempting. Mr. Burke says he slammed phone. ""We won't spend extraordinary amounts money any single runner detriment other runners,"" he says. Mr. de Castella's agent denies story entirely. What Los Angeles lacks superstars, it plans make numbers. This year's race may challenge New York and London largest marathon ever run. Some 20,500 started New York race last year. Mr. Lebow, organizer New York event, says next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number. For one sponsor, this may be mixed blessing. Orthopaedic Hospital, not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship is part publicity campaign, provides emergency care stations marathon route. Last year, one every 20 runners needed aid. Along sprains, strains and blisters came more serious cases exhaustion and hypothermia. A spokeswoman says: ""We advised 250 people quit race.""The Olympic trials, scheduled January, have made Nichols' job mucheasier this year. Most top-ranked U.S. women are looking any summer-timemarathon which run and San Francisco version offers excellentconditions.; The hills San Francisco make this marathon challenging. Theweather, however, makes it one few enticing races held June toSeptember.

He used start preparing earnest end ofJanuary. ""In recent years, I've been training 12 months ayear,"" he says, though serious stuff -- daily one-hourrun, sprints track and long, 2 1/2-hour runs everyother week -- begins December. (He doesn't count mileshe puts in, many long-distance runners obsessively do, buthe says he wouldn't object estimate 50 miles aweek.)Mr. Kelley always trains 5 a.m., and alone: ""It's aquiet time, no traffic; air is fresh and sweet."" Hisroutes vary. In January, he prefers frozen sands thebeach. With approach spring, he takes alder andscrub-pine hills and bluffs where sun can be seen risingover Cape Cod Bay. After his morning run, he spends coupleof hours painting (still lifes and Cape Cod scenes), hobbyhe took 25 years ago.Unlike many runners, Mr. Kelley doesn't bother withstretching exercises he runs morning.

She added:I'm sure sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us,too.The 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't when advertisers began clamoring pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton. She went grin relentlessly some $5 million worth commercial endorsements -- surely Olympic record itself. But when 1988 Summer Games ended Sunday night, so, too, chance American athletes follow her footsteps. Ad agency executives, who spend every fourth year glued their TV sets, hoping pick out next star hawk their clients' products, say that this Olympiad was dud. ""I suspect this will go dullest history Olympics,"" says Jerry Della Femina, chairman ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS. ""This is first Olympics passion, and passion you don't have testimonials. Without heroes, you don't have anyone that anyone wants emulate."" On surface, Games seemed offer all drama that makes lucrative endorsement contracts. Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking his head springboard, then coming back win two gold medals? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, her two-inch fingernails raking air she won 100-meter sprint? But these two, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won women's heptathalon and long jump, may find it more difficult previous years turn gold medals gold bank. The fact is, say many marketers, Olympic gold has lost much its commercial luster. ""I don't think it's big money it used be,"" says Michael Goldberg National Media Group Inc., New York sports-marketing firm that represents Ms. Retton. ""It used be kind knee-jerk reaction do ad campaign Olympic athlete. It just doesn't happen anymore."" Certainly, this year's winning Olympians will have no trouble securing contracts specialized sports-equipment outfitters and speaking invitations obscure trade groups. But major, high-paying endorsements -- such those soft-drink companies and fast-food outlets -- just don't seem be surfacing, least not yet. Earlier this year, sports marketers estimated that gold medal won Summer Games could earn personable athlete more $1 million endorsements. Now, marketers say, these medalists will be lucky pull $100,000 $500,000 year. Advertisers can reel litany reasons why these Olympics aren't igniting much spark. For one thing, they suffer comparison 1984 Summer Games, so exciting because they were held Los Angeles and because, absence boycotting Soviet-bloc countries, Americans won 83 gold medals. The 1988 Games, contrast, were broadcast halfway world, and Soviets trounced Americans, 55 gold medals 36. What's more, marketers say, this year's drug scandals cast pall Games, especially incident involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who lost his gold medal testing positive steroids. NBC's TV coverage also gets its share blame. Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently one event another that there was little chance excitement build. The constant commercial interruptions, which led ratings that were much lower expected, didn't help, either. During most Games, ""there was enough continuous TV coverage so that, much soap opera, it was possible get involved lives and competition,"" says Leigh Steinberg, attorney ice-skater Brian Boitano, gold medalist 1988 Winter Games. But not this summer, he says. Recent changes Olympic rules, meanwhile, have led glut Olympians search endorsement deals. Before 1984 Games, most Olympic athletes weren't allowed make commercials unless they gave their amateur status. Now, they can appear many ads they want, income must go trust fund training expenses. ""Every year, more and more Olympic people are out there wanting do commercials -- basically, everybody is available,"" says Daisy Sinclair, vice president ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As result, while once ""aura"" surrounded Olympian, now ""the bloom is off."" Companies also are becoming more sophisticated their approach celebrity endorsements. Increasingly cost conscious, they will no longer hook Olympian just because company president likes athlete's sport. And years paying big bucks Olympic stars only see them fade obscurity, companies have finally gotten hint that Olympian fame is most fleeting variety. ""If you think your phone will ring hook if (you win) gold medal, it isn't going happen anymore,"" says Stephen Disson, senior vice president marketing ProServ Inc., Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies now know that ""six months now there will be other heroes other sporting events"" them consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude Olympics is becoming typical. It uses sports stars its commercials Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds has no plans call any 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer use athletes who are public eye regular basis, football and basketball players,"" says Charles Miesmer, agency's executive creative director. ""People Michael Jordan have 10-plus years their sports careers, all row, so I don't have worry public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And don't look any 1988's winners start showing Wheaties boxes, either. General Mills Inc., which has featured Ms. Retton and decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner its Wheaties boxes past, says it looks three qualities endorser: career achievement, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishments. A spokeswoman says that none this year's crop meet all three criteria. So far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee has had most visible endorsements. Even Olympics began, she had made commercials Primatene mist and 7-Up. And, according her agent, Pearl Hodge World Class Management, she is now ""in process"" signing McDonald's Corp., work behalf its efforts aid underprivileged children. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take endorsement lead. Advertisers say her good looks and fashion flare, she is attracting more interest any other medal winners. (The sprinter's manager couldn't be reached comment.) Another Olympian endorsement potential is swimmer Matt Biondi, who won five gold medals. Mr. Biondi has already signed swim-wear contract Arena USA Inc., and Parkes Brittain, his agent Advantage International Inc., says his client ""will definitely be high-income ring, highest you can name."" Then there is Mr. Louganis. Since winning two gold medals 1984 Summer Olympics, diver has had little luck major endorsements. And few marketing executives say that his second sweep diving events may not his potential. ""When most advertisers are looking male hero, word 'macho' trails very closely,"" says Marty Blackman Blackman & Raber, sports-marketing firm New York. ""I don't find Louganis macho guy."" Still, other marketing professionals say that Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery smashing his head has secured diver's future. His manager, Jim Babbitt, won't comment any contract offers. He will say, however, that his client has ""done just fine. He isn't unhappy. He dives perform; he doesn't dive dollars."" ---Winning EndorsementsThere is only one former Olympian top sports endorsers last year.ATHLETE: Arnold Palmer (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Hertz, PaineWebber, Pennzoil, United Airlines, GTE, Toro, Loft Seed Co., Sears, Pro Group, Robert Bruce, Westin HotelsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $8 millionATHLETE: Jack Nicklaus (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Bostonian Shoe Co., Hart Schaffner & Marx, Optique Du Monde, Pine Hosiery Mills, WarnacoESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Boris Becker (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Coca-Cola, Deutsche Bank, Polaroid, UNICEFESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Greg Norman (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Reebok, Spalding, Epson Computers, Hertz, Qantas Airlines, Daikyo Group, Swan Lager & Castlemaine, Akubia HatsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4.5 millionATHLETE: Michael Jordan (Basketball, 1984 Olympian)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Nike, Wilson, Excelsior, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Johnson Products, Ohio ArtESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4 millionATHLETE: Ivan Lendl (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Gleneagles Country Club, Avis, Seiko, Adidas, Bow Brand StringsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: John Madden (Former football coach)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Ace Hardware, Miller Lite, Ramada, Exxon, Canon, GreyhoundESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: Jim McMahon (Football)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Taco Bell, Kraft Foods, Ebel Watches, Honda, Adidas, LJN Toys, Revo SunglassesESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: Dennis Conner (Yachting)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Rayban, Sperry Topsider, Wrigley's, Disney, Lacoste, Pepsi-ColaESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Chris Evert (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Lipton Iced Tea, Wilson Converse, Ellesse, Polo Club Boca Raton, Rolex, Evert Active Life Skin Care, Marchon Sunwear EllesseESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Martina Navratilova (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Lufthansa Airlines, Vuarnet, DHL, Sugar-Free Jello, Aspen Club, RKO Video, World Tennis MagazineESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Jackie Stewart (Retired race car driver)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Ford, Goodyear, USF&G, Rolex, Gleneagles, American Express, British Telecom, ICCIESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionSource: Sports Marketing NewsletterDebi Thomas' dream Olympic goldturned disappointment Saturday East Germany's Katarina Wittwon her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian ElizabethManley took home silver crowd cheering countrymen.It's over.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.

In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.

The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.

It hasinstead begun legal action have strike, which today entered itssecond week, declared illegal.The miners' position seems untenable. Romanians appear solidly opposed tothe strike, angered miners' demands average wage theequivalent Dollars 290 month. Most workers earn less Dollars 80.Workers same trade union confederation miners have ignoredappeals their leaders strike solidarity.The Ministry Industry argues that 6m tonnes pit coal produced eachyear Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not vital source energy. Theregion's coal supplies two nearby power stations these plants, whichtogether account only 4 cent country's electricity capacity,could also be run using lignite and gas.The ministry further argues that miners are danger pricing theircoal out market. According ministry, if miners' paydemands were met, cost their coal would double. Even presentprices, Ukrainian coal is being imported Romanian market.The strike seems motivated number factors. The rank and file havecome out because they want more money compensate difficultconditions which they live and work.They are also call their charismatic leader, Mr MironCosma, man who led them protests Bucharest and secured theirearlier wage increases.Mr Cosma's motive calling strike - which, surprisingly, he hasthe support RAH, state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.The ministries industry and finance are conducting investigations intocharges fraud and embezzlement Mr Cosma and several senior RAH companyofficials. The company's chief accountant and budget director have alreadybeen fired, earlier investigations.Ministry Industry officials argue strike could be attempt todivert attention investigations.Mr Cosma, however, appears confident. One his bargaining tools is thethreat, albeit veiled, fresh violence.In response question whether he intends lead his men, whoappear support him whole-heartedly, Bucharest again, he says: 'Withminers, anything is possible.'But he is also making political threats. In recent months, Mr Cosma hasclaimed he has evidence that senior government officials, includingPresident Ion Iliescu, called miners Bucharest part plans toconsolidate their power.Mr Cosma appears increasingly willing talk if his demands are not met. Itremains be seen whether those involved incidents 1990 and 1991now feel confident enough ignore him.Port workers Szczecin andsouthwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes withminers demanding l","AP880816-0135,AP890616-0230,FBIS4-42027,WSJ870804-0095,AP890720-0075,AP890719-0248,SJMN91-06069108,FT923-12122,AP890721-0091,AP891103-0200,FT933-9536,AP880817-0124",Coal miners strike in major coal regions around the world.,"Major strikes, mostly by coal miners seeking higher wages, seriously disrupted industries throughout the world from 1987 to 1994 in South Africa, Poland, Romania, the Ukraine, Siberia and Central Asia in the Soviet Union.

They all oughtto be eliminated, retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque Centerfor Defense Information said Thursday. I don't know what more ittakes get people recognize this ancient technology is nolonger appropriate warships.But Navy defended 16-inch gun, mightiest use onany ocean, explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboardthe battleship Iowa while turret crew loaded gunpowder targetpractice.This gun ... remains finest naval gun world. It wasthe pinnacle gun design art, and it is still front-linesystem, said Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander Iowa untillast May.The main criticism is that big gun requires gunpowder packedin silk bags fire 16-inch-diameter shells its 62-foot-longbarrel. It works breech-loaded guns that roared theCivil War: A shell is placed barrel and then charged withgunpowder separate package.In Iowa's case, 660 pounds powder  six 110-pound bags is needed fire projectile weighing 2,700 pounds aspeed 2,500 feet second. An electric spark ignites thepowder.The extremely flammable silk is supposed burn away theburst, some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases canbuild barrel. Air pressurized 3,000 pounds squareinch can be blown breech clear away debris guardagainst blowback, which happens when powder ignites beforethe breech is closed.In newer guns, powder is packed metal containers.

35,d085d,"Here is chronology Hurricane Hugo's destructive path acrossthe Caribbean South Carolina:Residents took forecasters their wordwhen they warned Hurricane Hugo's fury, and low number ofdeaths powerful storm can be credited this healthyrespect, authorities said.The storm, which caused billions damage, claimed 17 lives inSouth Carolina, and only two were Charleston area, whichbore brunt Hugo's 135 mph winds.We just feel very thankful that, said Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousands people who were sheltersand tens thousands people who evacuated inland werepotential victims injury and death.Riley and other officials credited residents monitoring thehurricane it spun Charleston, and heeding evacuationwarnings.The last big storm hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in1979, which hit coast pounding southern Florida.Since then several big storms have threatened veered away,and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've had so many close calls, said Gary Garnet, ameteorologist National Weather Service.But this storm was very, very strong, he said. This timethey realized it.Glen Ellis, Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000residents Charleston and three surrounding counties headedfor shelters.Tens thousands more got their cars and headed upInterstate 26 Columbia.Mayor John Bourne North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related deaths, credited people heeding thewarnings.It was bad, it could have been lot worse, he said.You've just got say nice things people.Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news storm-wearyCharlestonians: late Saturday tropics were quiet no otherstorms brewing.There's nothing worry out there, he said.This historic city has survived theravages earthquake, battle and storm its storied300-year-history, it faced perhaps its greatest test all inHurricane Hugo.The storm, packing winds 135 mph, raged CharlestonThursday night.This is dangerous, killer hurricane, likes which fewpeople who have lived all their lives Charleston haveexperienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.Hugo was first major hurricane strike Charleston sinceHurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles south 1959.The seaside community has suffered many disasters, bothnatural and man-made.The worst recent decades was 1938 when tornado torethrough city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causingan estimated $2 million property damage.Charleston, city pastel-colored antebellum structures liningquaint streets and alleyways, is where Civil War began 1861.The city has survived shot and shell two wars and anynumber smaller hurricanes, politely referred Charlestoniansof refinement September gales.But worst natural disaster beset city occurred thehot night Aug. 31, 1886, when ground rumbled what somefolks thought was prelude Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake was felt far away Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 Richter scale ground motion, theearthquake claimed estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildingsand tossed most city's 14,000 chimneys streets.In recent years, city has attracted millions visitorsannually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby finesand beaches.Charleston has received international acclaim home SpoletoFestival U.S.A., founded composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike refer Spoleto world's most comprehensive artsfestival.Supercomputers, satellites and expertise ofseveral hurricane forecasters predicted destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty time fleethe South Carolina coast.But hurricane tracking remains uncertain science.Forecasters National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path Charleston, S.C.All world's knowledge meteorological conditions andforecasting changes those conditions is embodied thosemodels, said Thomas Pyke, head National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.Pinpointing exact point Hugo's landfall was difficult, butforecasters said Friday that landfall was predicted time forevacuation.Overall, I think tracking models gave us very good ideawhere Hugo would be so officials South Carolina could act atimely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem Hugo was predicting theintensity storm, which was upgraded Category 4 hurricanejust hours it slammed Charleston.It is very difficult predict changes intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer models that, McAdie said.We really need improve our forecasting ability strength.The hurricane specialists were surprised last-minuteincrease wind speed, which was reported them Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes 35years, said that couple decades ago, only forecasting toolswere reports aircraft or ships.We had no radar or satellites then, so needless say ourforecasts were less accurate, Clark said.In late 1960s, weather service began using satellites toobtain global weather picture. Information satellite isused improve accuracy large-scale models thattelevision viewers see every night.Using information satellite, supercomputers theNational Meteorological Center Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where tracking model constantly changes toaccount current weather conditions and position thehurricane.To determine track storm, forecasters analyzesupercomputer predictions, satellite data, history similarstorms and current path hurricane.Then they make educated guess landfall.Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel MassachussettsInstitute Technology criticizes current forecasting system.Congress and American people are suffering thecollective delusion that our data problems have been solved bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give pretty picture, he said, not enoughinformation wind and temperatures that affect ahurricane's path.Most information actually used predict hurricanescomes flying airplanes hurricane, and they do verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say accuracy satellite pictures is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have remember that those models used are only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately job theforecaster predict storm's path.Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday thousands coastal residents insoutheastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.This is disaster staring us right eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. said his City Hall command post Charleston,where hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and causedutility transformers explode.All we can do now is pray and hope all precautions we havetaken have been sufficient, Riley said Hugo's eye bore onthe city. I just hope and pray we can get this anyloss life.By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported Charleston. The roofcracked City Hall, 188-year-old brick building that haswithstood several hurricanes, and torrents water poured thepaneled council chamber. Phone and electric service commandpost was knocked out.Hurricane-force winds first hit coast 9:15 p.m. EDT, andabout three hours later eye storm passed Isle ofPalms just east Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director theNational Hurricane Center Coral Gables, Fla.The eye was 10 miles and top winds were still 135mph.Hugo was expected turn gradually north, causing severeflooding it moved East Coast. The storm posed 19 percentchance hitting New York City and 16 percent chance hittingBoston Sunday night, hurricane center said.As Hugo neared coast, roads Hilton Head Myrtle Beach,200 miles north, were nearly empty, were boarded-up resorttowns themselves. Power lines and trees were downed some spotsand water flooded roads. Stop lights and neon lights were knockedout Myrtle Beach.One eyewitness said `It's light show,' said AmyGarrison, reporter WKZQ AM-FM Myrtle Beach.In Charleston, hurricane littered streets tin roofs,palmetto fronds and chunks bark. Businesses were closed andclasses public schools and universities canceled. Riley orderedresidents one-story homes evacuate.Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients wellenough go and moving hospitals inland make room foremergency patients, officials said.About 12,000 people had checked 83 shelters stateas Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,a spokesman Emergency Operations Center Columbia, 220miles northwest here.We tried close doors people are sneaking sidedoors, said Elaine Skelton, registered nurse working theConway High School shelter Myrtle Beach. We tried postguards doors, people were still coming in.American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling numberof evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, spokesman Savannah, Ga., whoappealed help.Right now Red Cross is sheltering tens thousands ofpeople all Eastern seaboard. This course is sametime that we're sheltering 25,000 people Puerto Rico and theother Caribbean islands.We're beginning feel squeeze. Our resources are verytight. Right now Hugo is shaping be one our biggest reliefoperations decade.At midnight, center Hugo was latitude 32.7 degreesnorth and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. Thehurricane's speed had picked 22 mph 20 mph earlier.Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds 135 mph, from125 mph earlier day and 105 mph day before. North andSouth Carolina can expect tornadoes linked Hugo next twodays, according hurricane center.The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds 10 12hours once eye comes ashore, officials said. A hurricane warningwas effect Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded category 4 hurricane onthe Saffir-Simpson scale strength, second mightiest category,which indicated it could cause extreme damage.It strengthened more we thought it would, Sheets said,adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding it moved theAppalachians.The timing landfall was critical because storm'stidal surge, dome water 10 15 feet high that would feed anormal 5-foot high tide that peaks 2 a.m.On top that will be waves, Sheets said earlier, and inmany places barrier islands buildings will be swept cleanoff.Amid uproar live coverage themajor networks and scores other media organizations, NationalHurricane Center forecasters went their business monitoringHurricane Hugo.The whole system looks chaotic, it works, said BobSheets, center's director.On one side large room dominated U-shaped bank ofmonitoring equipment were forecasters, making meticulouscalculations where deadly hurricane will strike andgetting emergency operations going those areas.On other side were media  pack reporters, cameraoperators and technicians, jockeying seconds Sheets' time andtidbits his expertise.In center was Sheets himself. Surrounded cameras, wiresand two dozen journalists pads and telephones, ubiquitousred-headed meteorologist has appeared television all week next toa large satellite monitor showing colorful images Hurricane Hugo.During prime news time, competing technicians and cameramen shoutand make rude hand gestures people get out their shots ofSheets.At his back, casually dressed forecasters who have been working12-hour days tracked storm computers and satellites.We obviously don't this and could probably do betterjob, everyone knows now because media, said hurricanespecialist Max Mayfield. In Caribbean, we were not so certainthe word got out. But we know Carolinas have been evacuated.When hurricane warning goes effect, It's $50 millionstatement, said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring cost ofemergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implementedwhen warning is posted.If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that storm was outthere, he said. Before hurricane warning system wasestablished, storm Hugo's power would have cost thousands oflives. But early today, days warnings and proper evacuationprocedures, there were no immediate reports deaths despitewidespread damage Charleston and other coastal areas SouthCarolina.I think that we make difference far human livesare concerned, Cline said.After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and other forecasters began towind hectic pace they had maintained lastseveral days. But, he warned, hurricane center still isfollowing three other weather systems that have moved theAtlantic United States and Africa, and another storm inthe Pacific.I hate say we're breathing sigh relief because peopleare getting clobbered death, meteorologist Mark Zimmer said asthe storm pounded Charleston, S.C. But we've done all we can.Damage Hurricane Hugo, which stormed Carolinas and Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings several insurers. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related Hugo reduce pretax earnings $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover first $35 million losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover bulk remaining damages. AIG insured property Puerto Rico, eastern Caribbean Islands and coastal regions Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based St. Paul, Minn, said pretax cost Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount takes consideration what St. Paul expects recover its reinsurance contracts, company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected disclose Hugo's likely impact its earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, insurance industry analyst Shearson Lehman Hutton New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced 50 cents and 65 cents share after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% 40% his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments Hugo will exceed $400 million South Carolina alone, far surpassing company's record payout single disaster. When damages North Carolina and Virginia are added, company said, payments will exceed $500 million. It said that is more three times previous record $165 million set Hurricane Alicia, which hit Houston-Galveston, Texas, area 1983.The greenhouse effect may breed bigger anddeadlier hurricanes future, storms 50 percent strongerthan Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, somemeteorologists say.Hugo blasted eastern Caribbean and Carolinas 135 mphwinds this week, killing least 41 people.Just Hugo struck U.S. coast, its pressure was measuredat 940 millibars. That made it 12 strongest hurricanesthis century hit United States, National HurricaneCenter's Miles Lawrence said today.Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore Caribbean lastyear, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage. It was mostpowerful hurricane ever recorded.Gilbert seems be upper limit hurricane withcurrent ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel meteorologydepartment Massachusetts Institute Technology.But if seas warm up, say 3 6 degrees Fahrenheit, thewind speeds might be 25 percent higher  which means destructiveforce would be more 50 percent higher, he said.Stephen Schneider, deputy director National Center forAtmospheric Research Denver, said his research suggests thewarming trend is already here.Schneider, expert greenhouse effect and author newbook Global Warming, said six 10 hottest years thelast 100 occurred 1980s.He projects that 1990s will be hotter.Hugo demonstrated effect warm Atlantic waters when itswinds jumped 105 mph 135 mph it passed GulfStream hitting East Coast, Schneider said.You'll get worse hurricanes if Caribbean is warmer, hesaid. And I think there are better-than-even odds that you willhave stronger hurricanes.Emanuel said if ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanesof future could grow Gilbert's strength  and future Gilbertswill be stronger.Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director nationalhurricane center, said forecasters may have use intensityscale 1-6 future, instead current 1-5, fivethe highest.The computer models Schneider uses show that worst-casescenario, next 100 years world's temperature could jumpby 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas  which bothcontribute greenhouse effect  continue pour theatmosphere unchecked.It is possible that though world whole heats up,the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler. But he said that isunlikley.That's not what models are showing, Schneider said. Andthat's another reason I'd slow global warming.","AP890922-0193,AP890925-0054,AP890922-0049,AP890922-0167,LA092789-0093,AP890922-0007,AP890922-0072,WSJ890928-0084,AP890923-0035",Record damage by 1989's Hurricane Hugo in Caribbean and Carolinas,"In September 1989, Category 4 Hurricane Hugo, with 135mph winds, damaged the eastern Caribbean then hit South Carolina, where coastal residents fled inland or into shelters. 17 Carolinians were killed.

It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo. Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.",Hurricane Hugo Could Have Been Deadlier. Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.",,,,

Let him respondto criticism, said Philibosian, now private law practice.Also criticized was decision investigators use aprivate child therapy group, Children's Institute International, toconduct original interviews children. Defenseattorneys maintained that questions institute's researcherswere leading and prejudicial.Jurors agreed.We never got children's stories their words, saidjuror John Breese.Children's Institute officials didn't immediately returntelephone calls seeking comment.Originally, there were seven defendants, including RaymondBuckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, thefounder school, mother Mrs. Buckey and grandmother ofRaymond Buckey.Hundreds allegations child molestation were filed thecase, which gained worldwide attention its tales ofunderground tunnels school and Satanic rituals.The focus case shifted dramatically years asReiner reduced number charges and dropped five defendantsafter reviewing case.

The charges against the sister, grandmother and the three employees were dropped for lack of evidence. In reaching their verdict, the jury said that the videotaped interviews of the child were a factor in finding the Buckeys innocent.

42,d075b,"The expensive practice using ballooncatheters force open heart arteries immediately heartattacks, now routinely done many large hospitals, is unnecessaryand should be abandoned, according major study released Tuesday.The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receiveclot-dissolving drugs, they don't need extra step thecommon balloon procedure, known angioplasty.Some experts said results are good news, because they meanthat most heart attack patients can be treated communityhospitals, where angioplasty is not available.The study also has important financial message. Its authorsestimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted heartattacks, it could raise nation's annual medical bills $704million.This trial has settled one most important questions inmodern-day cardiology, commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy theUniversity Washington, Seattle.The study is phase 2 Thrombolysis Miocardial InfarctionTrial, or TIMI-II, directed Dr. Eugene Braunwald Brigham andWomen's Hospital Boston.The first phase study showed that giving people aclot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA,immediately heart attacks dramatically improved their chancesof survival.The latest study, presented annual meeting AmericanHeart Association, was intended see whether people betterstill if doctors tried clear away any remaining blockages aftergiving TPA.At 50 hospitals United States, doctors randomlyassigned 1,636 patients get angioplasty two days theirheart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they mightbenefit. Sixty percent them actually underwent procedure,which temporarily inflates balloons dangerously narrowed heartarteries squeeze them open.A comparison group 1,626 also got TPA. But they were notconsidered angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain orabnormal exercise tests their recovery.After 42 days, 11 percent those angioplasty group haddied or suffered further heart attacks, 10 percent thosein comparison group.A year treatment, there was no difference survival.About 93 percent groups were still alive.There does not appear be any additional benefit fromangioplasty, Braunwald said.Dr. Thomas J. Ryan Boston University Medical Center commented,We have answer this trial very important question ofhealth care delivery.While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs heartattack patients, most them do not have sophisticated labswhere angioplasty is performed.If study had found that immediate angioplasty improvessurvival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs wouldneed be established and more doctors trained give theprocedure.The watch word is watchful waiting see if patients needangioplasty. This ultimately makes it possible patients betreated community hospitals and be transfered terciary carecenters if angioplasty is needed, said Dr. Howard Morgan,immediate president heart association.Heart attacks occur when clot blocks artery that feeds theheart muscle. The purpose TPA and similar drugs is dissolvethese clots muscle dies. To be effective, drugs mustbe given four hours start heart attacksymptoms.Experts say that only 20 percent heart attack victimsare considered be candidates drugs. Many people delaygoing hospital permanent damage occurs. In others, thetreatment may be considered too dangerous because recent surgeryor history strokes.Balloon angioplasty is also widely used treat people withclogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks. Thelatest study not question usefulness this kind ofangioplasty.Deaths heart and blood vesseldisease dropped 24 percent decade, it remains byfar nation's biggest killer, taking life every 32 seconds, theAmerican Heart Association said Sunday.The good news is that we continue see improvement thedeath rate biggest killer our population, said Dr.Bernadine Healy Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is presidentof heart association.Those trends are dramatic and don't seem be reversing, shesaid. The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1million Americans year, and we've got long way go.The association released statistics its annual forum forscience writers.Experts attribute decline death rates combination ofhealthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food,and improved medical treatment.The public ought appreciate progress that has been madein heart disease 20 years, said Dr. Myron L.Weisfeldt Johns Hopkins University. It's almost unbelievable.There is almost no form heart disease that we can't approachwithout meaningful treatment.However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect heartassociation, also cautioned that much work remains, inimproving care and encouraging people take better care theirhealth.I believe we can prevent least 50 percent ischemicheart disease United States year 2000 if we stopsmoking, get cholesterol treated if it's 220, and identify andtreat hypertension, he said.Ischemic heart disease is clogging blood vessels that feedthe heart. It underlies most heart attacks, single most lethalheart ailment.Association figures indicated that 1986  most recent yearfor which there are statistics  estimated 978,500 Americans diedfrom heart attacks, strokes and other diseases heart andblood vessels. Cancer, No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.Between 1976 and 1986, death rate all forms ofcardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It declined 28 percent forheart attacks and 40 percent strokes.The association's figures show that more one fourAmericans suffers some form cardiovascular disease, and almosthalf those eventually die it.About 60 percent heart attack deaths occur thevictim reaches hospital. Studies show that half allheart attack victims wait more two hours getting anemergency room.Weisfeldt said major health goal is getting people go thehospital three or four hours first sign heartattacks. During this period, there is still time give them drugsto dissolve blood clots that are causing their heart attacks.This treatment can lives and reduce disability heartattacks.Other major goals, he said, include finding ways improve theeffectiveness angioplasty, technique that uses balloons openclogged heart arteries, and finding surgical and medical techniquesto identify and protect people risk cardiac arrest.The heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease willcost $88.2 billion this year medical expenses and lost wages.Among other statistics released association:The most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure,which affects 60 million Americans.About 200,000 deaths cardiovascular disease eachyear occur people age 65.There were 1,418 heart transplants 1987, almost nine times asmany 1983.About 2.5 million Americans have angina, chest painresulting clogged heart arteries. About 300,000 new cases occurannually.As many 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks thisyear.A drug that eases heart's workload cancut risk new cardiac attacks and death 20 percent inpeople recovering heart attacks, according major studyreleased Thursday.The study, conducted Denmark, found that drug Verapamil,known calcium channel blocker, was effective 1{ yearsafter heart attack. Calcium blockers are several classes ofmedicines commonly prescribed relieve high blood pressure.This is first trial that indicates that calcium blockermay be beneficial acute myocardial infarction, or heartattack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine University Florida.Several other studies calcium blockers, including one largeU.S. study published last year, failed find any benefit fromusing medicines heart attacks.According Danish study, Verapamil is effectiveas another variety blood pressure medicines known betablockers protecting people heart attacks.While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers heartattacks, researchers said these drugs still should have rolein treatment.We feel it is important have alternatives. Many patients donot tolerate beta blockers, said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard ofCentral County Hospital Hillerod, Denmark, co-author thestudy.Beta blockers are generally not recommended people withasthma and emphysema. This means drugs cannot be given tocigarette smokers, who are frequent victims heart attacks.In study, conducted 20 community hospitals, doctorscompared 897 patients who got Verapamil heart attacks with878 people who took placebos.After 18 months followup, there were 146 deaths or recurringheart attacks Verapamil patients, compared 180 inpeople who got dummy medication.We wanted see if effect would be observed withVerapamil, said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen Copenhagen MunicipalHospital.If it had effect, it should be seen first 12 18months, because there is big increase mortality myocardialinfarction this period, he said. Then it levels off. That'swhat we demonstrated. It worked.The researchers believe that reducing amount workneeded heart sustain circulation, calcium blockerslowered chances ischemia, episodes which heart's ownmuscle is deprived oxygen.They said they were unsure why earlier studies failed showany benefit calcium blockers heart attacks. However,they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also takingbeta blockers. And this might have obscured any benefits fromcalcium blockers.The results were presented meeting American Collegeof Cardiology. Among other research described meeting:Dr. James H. Chesebro Mayo Clinic said five-year studyfound that aspirin does not stop continued buildup existingblockages arteries feeding heart, although it maymodestly protect development new deposits. However,like other studies, this one found that aspirin signficantly cutthe risk heart attacks.Dr. Eugene Braunwald Harvard Medical School said nextphase large study clot-dissolving drugs will see whateffect they have unstable angina. This is condition whichpeople suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered workor stress. Until now, drugs have been used only treat heartattacks.An intestinal operation lower cholesterolof heart attack patients reduced their risk another heartattack or death heart disease, researchers said today.The surgery, called partial ileal bypass, has one significantdrawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists years.In operation, doctors change route smallintestine so one-third it is bypassed. This reduces theamount cholesterol that is absorbed bloodstream.The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted people who hadalready suffered heart attacks. The approach lengthened livesof people who had very mild heart attacks not those moresevere heart damage.During average 10 years follow up, death rate amongsurgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24percent. In comparison group intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percent.Dr. Henry Buchwald University Minnesota, who directedthe study, said surgery should be considered withcholesterol-lowering drugs possible standard treatment.It has role management patients highcholesterol who have had heart attack, Buchwald said. It iseminently logical extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, patients high cholesterol who have not hada heart attack.Besides diarrhea, those who undergo surgery are somewhatmore prone have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinalobstructions.The study was conducted Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published today's NewEngland Journal Medicine.Despite wide acceptance cholesterol lowering, doubts remainabout whether it actually helps people live longer if they alreadyhave healthy hearts. Although latest study was conductedexclusively people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald saidhe believes research should settle that question.It offers strongest justification marked lipid(cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered, Buchwaldsaid. It is very powerful study and should, certainpeople who will never be satisfied, end cholesterolcontroversy.In study, 421 people who recovered heart attacksunderwent surgery, while comparison group 417 people weretreated diet alone. At start study, their averagecholesterol levels were 251. The surgery lowered people'scholesterol 23 percent.The overall risk dying heart disease or sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent thesurgical patients healthiest hearts. The surgical patientsalso required less half many coronary bypass operationsbecause clogged heart arteries.New treatments that stop heart attack itstracks may help victims get out hospital more quicklythan ever before, perhaps three days their attacks, astudy published today concludes.Doctors University Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effects sending few carefully selected heart patients homeearly. They found that these people had no unusual complications,got back work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.It was extraordinarily safe strategy, said Dr. Eric J.Topol, study's director. There were no problems anyserious events.Topol said early discharges were made possible two recentmedical advances  tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, andangioplasty.When given quickly heart attack, TPA can dissolve clotsin heart's arteries and minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar results opening clogged arteries withtiny balloons.The report represents latest steady three-decade trendof sending heart attack patients home hospital evershorter stays.However, study New England Journal Medicine saidmore research is needed findings are widely adopted.In 1950s, doctors recommended that patients stay inbed one two months heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffered uncomplicated heart attack in1955, he spent seven weeks recovering hospital.However, doctors learned that long inactivity more harm thangood. Patients got out shape, developed blood clots and becamedemoralized.In 1960s, stay was shortened three weeks and the1970s two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalized seven 10 days.In their paper, doctors determined that 80 507 heartattack patients studied were healthy enough be considered forearly discharge. None them had irregular heart beats, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill tests showed no signs heart attackdamage.Forty patients were sent home three days, while reststayed seven 10 days. After six months followup, none haddied, and number medical problems groups was similar.However, people early discharge group were able returnto work two weeks sooner others, and their medicalbills were significantly lower  $12,546 $17,868.The researchers estimated that if 15 percent all heart attackpatients were discharged three days, annual saving wouldbe least $280 million.In accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, deputyeditor journal, cautioned that study was not largeenough spot complications that might result reducinghospital stays.This single study, he wrote, is not sufficient justifysweeping changes current management practices all patientswho may first appear have uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors should be cautious prescribing aspirin preventer heart attacks more research supports its value, Food and Drug Administration said. Taking aspirin prevent heart attacks may increase some people's chances dying other things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, agency said commentary today's Journal American Medical Association. The FDA persuaded aspirin makers March refrain promoting aspirin preventer first heart attacks, least now. A study published January indicated aspirin every other day reduced risk nonfatal, first heart attacks 47% 11,000 male doctors five years, compared 11,000 who took non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tends promote bleeding reducing ability blood platelets help form clots. Heart attacks occur when clots form arteries nourishing heart and choke its blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risks people who already have clotting problems, or those who have high blood pressure, which puts them increased risk hemorrhagic strokes, FDA commentary said. Strokes are result brain damage caused bleeding brain or blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes are those caused bleeding. The FDA commentary pointed 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded 11,000 subjects taking aspirin recent study, compared two such strokes 11,000 subjects taking substitute. Overall death rates two groups were same, though aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate was much lower. There were 104 nonfatal heart attacks aspirin users and 189 comparison group. ""Physicians, will, time, be forced make their professional judgments aspirin use basis incomplete information,"" said FDA commentary, co-written agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree them completely,"" said Dr. Julie Buring, Harvard University researcher who participated aspirin study. She added telephone interview yesterday that extension study is way, and researchers expect report FDA late fall. The commentary noted British study, also released January, 5,000 male physicians that found that aspirin failed protect heart attacks, and that it was associated 2 1/2-fold increase disabling strokes.A drug used treat patients complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks infour out five heart patients, according study published intoday's edition New England Journal Medicine.Surprisingly, however, study found that drug, diltiazem,increases chance subsequent heart attack patients whosehearts pump abnormally, experts said.Even so, results may trigger increase use thedrug, which is now primarily used treat angina, doctors said.The drug was tested 38 hospitals United States andCanada patients who had recently suffered heart attack, saidDr. Arthur Moss, clinical professor medicine Universityof Rochester and principal investigator study.The results suggest drug may be quite effective indecreasing likelihood second heart attack majorityof patients, Moss said. But study also surprisingly suggeststhat patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be givendiltiazem because drug increases chance subsequentheart attack.We now know when prescribe this drug and when not to,Moss said. That's what this study was all about.Diltiazem is calcium entry blocker, newest class drugsto be introduced fight heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blockers are other types commonly prescribed doctors.The study involved 2,466 heart attack patients, who were giveneither 240 milligrams diltiazem day or placebo. Patientswere recruited 1983 1986 and followed 12 52 months.Overall, drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11percent, which was not statistically significant, Moss said.But patients who had normal or near-normal heart pumpfunction  1,909 patients or 80 percent total group diltiazem decreased chance another heart attack 25percent, Moss said.In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, drug not onlydidn't help, it increased chance heart attack 25percent.Dr. John Schroeder, cardiologist and professor StanfordUniversity, said he was surprised that drug increased thechance heart attack any group and that overall results werenot higher.But bottom line is that this is first study showthat diltiazem can be effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean that more patients will be routinely put this drug ona long-term basis.Dr. George Beller, cardiologist and professor theUniversity Virginia, said he was also somewhat surprised aboutthe increase heart attacks group suffering pulmonarycongestion.This is one first reports that seems identifythat, he said.Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introducedin decade, Beller said, and research how effectivethey are various applications is its early stages.Nitrates have been used more 50 years, and betablockers were developed 1960s.Aspirin sales jumped 41 percent few weeksearlier this year, not because rash headaches.A study more 22,000 male doctors had shown that taking asingle aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk half.The study was one series recent reports showing thefirst time that doctors are able not only treat heart attacks also prevent them.In most recent report, doctors found that one aspirin tabletand single dose clot-dissolving drug given 24 hourscan dramatically cut risk second fatal heart attack.Without treatment, patients had 13 percent chance dyingfrom second heart attack five weeks, researchersfound. With treatment, figure dropped 8 percent.The real discovery is that treatment patients is going toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, says Richard Peto ofOxford University, one study's authors.Heart disease is nation's leading cause death, far.The National Center Health Statistics reports that 762,820Americans died heart disease 1987.To put it another way: Of 2,127,000 American who died thatyear, more one three died heart disease. (This does notinclude those who died blood-vessel diseases, such strokes.)The drugs most responsible recent success preventingheart attacks are new clot-dissolvers and that old standby,aspirin.The usual cause heart attacks is blockage coronaryarteries, which supply heart muscle oxygen-rich blood. Theblockage arises buildup fats, cholesterol and clottedblood.Clot-dissolvers break clots, thus restoring blood flow.Aspirin interferes aspects clotting process, helping toprevent clot formation first place.The limited sales clot-dissolving drugs UnitedStates show that many doctors are still not using them, despitetheir proven success. But that is beginning change.Some doctors predict that not-too-distant future thesedrugs will be judged so safe that they will be administeredroutinely paramedics ambulances suspected heart attackvictims reach hospital.We have know how respond quickly, and we have havethe courage use these drugs absence definitivediagnosis, says Dr. Burton Sobel Washington University St.Louis, pioneer testing clot-dissolvers.The most important thing we can do is teach patients inadvance value early treatment, he says.While most public attention has focused this new ability toprevent heart attacks, researchers have also made importantprogress speeding recovery patients who survive heartattacks.Researchers University Michigan recently determinedthat some heart attack victims can be released hospital assoon three days their heart attacks. Most heart attacksvictims are kept hospital least seven 10 days.The patients given early discharge were able return worktwo weeks sooner study group. After six months,not one death was recorded early-discharge group. Theresearchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent heart attacksvictims could be safely discharged three days.In July, Stanford University doctors found that workers who wentback their jobs seven weeks their heart attacks didat least well workers who went back more typicalconvalescence 10 or 11 weeks.All these advances come time when public health expertsare increasingly emphasizing role good health and goodnutrition lowering heart disease risk.Early next year, American Heart Association seal approvalwill begin appearing foods that are low fat and cholesteroland therefore can help reduce heart disease risk.U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop July issued his firstreport nutrition, calling Americans lower theirconsumption fats and eat more vegetables, fruits, fish,poultry and whole grains.The report has been likened first Surgeon Generals reporton smoking, issued 1964, which focused public attention onsmoking's hazards. Koop's recommendations largely echo those theAmerican Heart Association, they should help carry messageto many more people.Progress research heart disease is making clear that theheart attack is no longer mysterious killer that strikes withoutwarning and cannot be defended against.Much can be done prevent heart attacks, great improvementsare being made treatments, and recovery is faster everbefore.The use clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save25,000 lives year United States, doctors say.These results, says Dr. Peter Sleight Oxford University,will change medical practice worldwide.A natural substance called transforming growthfactor beta appears be able limit damage cardiac cellsfollowing heart attack, according study published thejournal Science.In study Jefferson Medical College Philadelphia, agroup laboratory rats induced have heart attacks suffered 50percent less cell damage injections transforming growthfactor beta rats that not receive TGF beta.TGF beta is growth factor that opposes some bad guysfollowing heart attack, said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, professor atJefferson.Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks 24 ratsby partially blocking key arteries their hearts.In 12 rats, researchers injected placebo. In theother 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.For those who received TGF beta, said Lefer, damagefrom attack was much less severe. There was 50 percentless injury TGF beta it.The extent heart cell damage was determined measuring theamount creatine kinase heart tissue attack.Hearts damaged when blood supply is interrupted, heartattack, tend lose creatine kinase, said Lefer. Thus, bymeasuring loss this substance, researchers coulddetermine amount heart damage.Lefer said TGF beta seems block action othersubstances, such tumor necrosis factor, that can cause bloodvessels narrow heart attack. Narrowed blood vesselscarry less oxygen-rich blood cells and this causes additionalinjury heart attack.TGF beta is normally present heart cells, studypublished Science said that it is missing rat heart cellsdamaged simulated heart attack.Though TGF beta is produced naturally body, Lefer saidhis research team used substance produced artificially byGenentech, California biotechnology firm.Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies withTGF beta and that any experimental treatment human heart attackvictims substance is least year away.Jefferson Medical College, where study was done, is part ofThomas Jefferson University Philadelphia.Science, which published study, is journal theAmerican Association Advancement Science.The experiment also hinted that blood and urine test,which measures activity blood protein called renin,might suggest new ""risk factor"" heart attacks. Abouthalf 1.5 million Americans who suffer heart attackeach year don't have known risk factors heartdisease, such high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking,obesity and high blood pressure. It is unknown whatdistinguishes these seemingly healthy people those whodon't suffer heart attacks.The blood and urine test is already being done manycommercial laboratories medical conditions other thanheart attack risk, said John H. Laragh CardiovascularCenter Cornell University and New York Hospital. ""In ourhands, it cost $40 and other labs it may cost thepatient $40 $80,"" he said. Dr. Laragh pioneered theresearch underlying use test, which was developed byhis wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey. The test, which isn'tpatented, is available kit form laboratories.The blood portion test determines whether thekidneys are releasing renin blood stream and howactive chemical is. The release renin is firststep rapid chemical chain reaction that raises bloodpressure. The urine portion test tells how much saltis bloodstream. A high concentration salt theblood also raises pressure.The test is based fact that if saltconcentration blood rises, tending boost bloodpressure, activity renin normally drops offsetthe effect salt.The new experiment was designed test theory put forthby Dr. Laragh and his colleagues that activity therenin blood foretells possible heart attack. Thetheory has provoked sometimes furious controversy almost20 years.The Cornell cardiologist has argued that many peoplewith high blood pressure activity renin theblood is much higher is warranted amount saltin blood. Such ""high renin"" people are high risk ofa heart attack. On other hand, other patients withhigh blood pressure, activity renin is much lowerthan is warranted degree salt blood. These""low renin"" people are low risk heart attack, Dr.Laragh has maintained.In experiment, blood and urine samples were obtainedat New York City offices and factories 1,717 worke","AP881115-0113,AP890115-0014,AP900322-0112,AP901003-0006,AP880428-0041,WSJ880603-0129,AP880818-0088,AP880829-0222,AP900705-0149,WSJ910418-0105",,,,,New medical advances reduce the number of heart attacks nationwide.,"The chances of having a heart attack, the number one killer in the United States, have decreased significantly in the last decade. Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

The first eruptions shot gas, steam and ash 12,000 feet above the mountain. Today's eruptions spewed matter over 12 miles high, and a possible lava flow was seen for the first time. Clark, evacuated nearly a week ago, is covered in ash, as is Subic Bay naval base, which received the 16,000 Clark evacuees. U.S. officials, while not commenting on whether nuclear weapons are at the abandoned base, denied the possibility of radioactive contamination if molten rock hits the weapons depots. At least four deaths and 24 people injured have been recorded since Pinatubo began erupting after six centuries of dormancy. About 84,000 have been evacuated. Heavy rains today have raised fears of catastrophic mudflows.Pinatubo is in the ""Ring of Fire"" that circles the Pacific. Mount Unzen in Japan, also in the ring, recently erupted, killing 38.President Aquino toured refugee centers and authorized the release of $1.42 million for relief efforts.

The highest, USGS says,is central California town Parkfield, where there is 90percent probability magnitude 6 earthquake year 2018.Ever 1906 earthquake devastated SanFrancisco, many scientists have believed next big one wouldstrike Los Angeles end mighty San Andreas Fault.But studies recent years have reminded Bay Area that italso faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became areality Tuesday when quake measuring 6.9 Richter scalerocked Bay area.A 1985 paper Geophysical Research Letters predicted a6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time portion SanAndreas Fault that stretches 50 miles Palo Alto southwardthrough Santa Cruz Mountains and San Juan Bautista.The quake was centered San Andreas segment described inthe article, Tom Heaton, scientist charge U.S.Geological Survey office Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yetwhether it broke all or part 50-mile segment.The epicenter quake was 8 miles northeast SantaCruz and 75 miles south San Francisco.The 1985 study, Columbia University geology professorChristopher Scholz, was several that produced conflictingestimates likelihood and size quake that finallyhappened Tuesday.These studies gave various interpretations how much stressinside Earth was released great San Francisco earthquakeof 1906, which had magnitude 8.3 and killed least2,500 people.The bigger quake, more stress it relieves, and thus thelonger it takes same size quake happen again.Scholz pointed evidence that 1906 quake didn't relieve asmuch stress Santa Cruz Mountains other scientistsbelieved. That suggested bigger quake might happen SanFrancisco Bay area sooner some believed.Others disagreed. Faced conflicting estimates, theGeological Survey issued July 1988 report that it saidrepresented consensus debate.The report said 50-mile segment had 20 percent likelihoodof producing magnitude-7 quake 30 years. It said thesouthernmost 20 miles that segment had 30 percent chance ofgenerating magnitude-6.5 quake 30 years.Tuesday's jolt was centered those southernmost 20 milesof fault segment.Clearly, scientists had identified this segment aparticularly hazardous one, Heaton said. There was some debateabout length rupture and size earthquake.The last great southern California quake, 1857, killed veryfew people region that was then sparsely populated.Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not Bay Area, would fallvictim next seismic catastrophe; 1988 USGS report castdoubt this assumption.Federal emergency officials have estimated that next bigone  quake 1906 San Francisco quake  could kill3,000 14,000 people southern California, and 3,000 11,000people Bay Area.As bad Tuesday's quake was, it was not 1906 earthquake,Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.The question is not whether big earthquake is coming. Thequestion is when, Peck said.","AP891017-0199,AP891019-0037,LA102089-0177,AP891017-0195,LA101889-0066,LA101889-0108,LA102389-0075,LA102089-0172,AP891017-0204,AP891018-0084","6.9 earthquake rocked Northern California October 17, 1989, at predicted epicenter","A 6.9 earthquake rocked Northern California on October 17, 1989, at a predicted epicenter.

But impacts are going be feltover most Texas area.The hurricane center said Gilbert was most intense storm onrecord terms barometric pressure, which was measured 26.31inches, breaking 26.35 inches recorded 1935 hurricanethat devastated Florida Keys.In Yucatan state capital Merida, storm's 160 mphwinds destroyed nearly all thatched houses one district,uprooted trees, road signs and cut water supplies, saidGonzalez Correa, news editor Novedades.A spokeswoman National Civil Defense System MexicoCity said least 20,000 people had flocked Merida coastalareas.Civil defense officials said 6,000 tourists left beachsidemotels and 30,000 local people also sought temporary shelter. U.S.consular officials said they not know how many tourists were inCancun, which receives 50,000 visitors month.The storm, spawned Saturday southeast Puerto Rico, appearedto have hit Jamaica hardest. That island nation's primeminister, Edward Seaga, said Wednesday that it destroyed about100,000 Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage $8billion.Earlier Wednesday, Gilbert was classified Category 5 storm,the strongest and deadliest type hurricane. Such storms havemaximum sustained winds greater 155 mph and can causecatastrophic damage.By Wednesday night, National Hurricane Center downgraded itto Category 4 and Category 3 this morning.Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit United States  the1935 storm that killed 408 people Florida and Hurricane Camille,which devastated Mississippi coast 1969 and killed 256people.With winds Hurricane Gilbert clocked 175miles hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert mostintense hurricane ever recorded Western Hemisphere.Mark Zimmer, meterologist National Hurricane Center,reported Air Force reconnaissance plane measured barometricpressure Gilbert's center 26.13 inches 5:52 p.m. EDT onTuesday. Gilbert was barreling Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.That's lowest pressure ever measured WesternHemisphere, Zimmer said. The previous record low pressure of26.35 inches was set 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struckthe Florida Keys winds 150 mph, killing 408 people, hesaid.With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and200 miles south hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one ofthe largest. But because circumference hurricane changesso its course, no records are kept their overallsize, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed 74 mph threshold tohurricane strength striking Mexico last month, was probablyabout half that size, Moore said.Gilbert is one only three Category 5 storms hemispheresince weather officials began keeping detailed records. The otherswere 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, whichbulldozed Mississippi Coast 172 mph winds and 28-footwave 1969, leaving $1.4 billion damage and 256 dead.A 1900 hurricane is responsible worst natural disasterin U.S. history, however. That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8and killed more 6,000 people.Category 5 storms have winds greater 155 mph, barometricpressure less 27.17 inches and storm surge higher 18feet.The storm surge  great dome water that follows eye ofthe hurricane coastlines, bulldozing everything its path accounts nine out 10 hurricane fatalities.Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, hurricane centerwas forecasting surge only 8-12 feet Gilbert, Zimmer said.The damage these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs andwindows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.Moisture and heat are what drives hurricane, Zimmersaid. The engine itself is this tall chimney warm, moist airin center. If atmospheric conditions general allow thiswarm chimney build very high levels, 10-12 miles high, thenyou can have severe hurricane.Category 4 storms cause extreme damage winds 131 to155 mph, surge 13-18 feet and pressure 27.17 27.90. Theweakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage winds of74 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure 28.94 or more.Rains Hurricane Gilbert sent ariver raging its banks Monterrey, sweeping least 10policemen their deaths and overturning buses loaded withevacuees Matamoros, police said today.The flooding occurred Monterrey, industrial city 3million people, located 110 miles Texas border and 140miles inland Matamoros.At least 10 police officers were swept away while rescuemission midnight, judicial police officer said.

He said they were lot more comfortablewith black chauffeur `Driving Miss Daisy' theangry characters his film.I still feel we made best film year, he said.Asked if racism might have been involved academynominations, Lee replied, Racism's involved everything.Despite cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse students welcomed himas one their own.He's African-American, one first ones make it (asa producer and director), and he's addressing issues andconcerns affecting our community, Syracuse senior Deron Harrissaid. That's why we're so proud him.What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, CaryGrant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have common? Theyhave never won Academy Awards their individual achievements.Such flagrant omissions are cited critics evidenceof unfairness Hollywood's highest prize. Oscar's 60-yearhistory is filled examples film world's highestachievers being overlooked Academy Motion Picture Artsand Sciences.The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movieBroadcast News was nominated though he wasn't, and Spielbergwho was left out cold his Empire Sun.Although Broadcast News won seven major nominations,including best picture and three acting categories, Brooks wasstrangely overlooked Academy's directing branch.Since no movie has ever won best picture Oscar itsdirector least being nominated, chances once-favoredBroadcast News be big winner awards ceremony onApril 11 have been significantly reduced.Brooks better 1984 when his Terms Endearment tookthe lion's share Oscars, including best picture and director.Spielberg's Empire Sun won six nominations this year,none them major and none director. Two years ago, TheColor Purple received 11 nominations not him director.The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.I'm floored this, Spielberg said receiving his DGAaward. This is last thing I expected happen. ... If someof you are making statement  thank God  I thank you that.Why Spielberg slight? Some observers cite fact that only257 directors nominate Academy Awards, and many areveterans who might not look kindly young man whose films arethe biggest moneymakers history (Jaws, E.T., Raidersof Lost Ark).The Academy appeared make amends last year presentingSpielberg Irving Thalberg award consistently highquality production. There was no mention fact thatSpielberg is primarily director, not producer.The Thalberg award has come handy acknowledge giants whowere overlooked individual awards. The recipients have includedCecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergmanand Mervyn Leroy.The honorary award has also proved useful salve Academy'sconscience. Charlie Chaplin received one first AcademyAwards his creation The Circus and again 44thawards incalculable effect he has had making motionpictures art form this century.Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch,Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, MauriceChevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G.Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are whohave received honorary awards.Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected win anAcademy Award. I'd have blacken my teeth first, he quipped,alluding Academy's fondness actors who portray bums anddowntrodden characters.Alfred Hitchcock also had lighthearted comment why hefailed win Oscar: I suppose it was matter ofcarelessness.The overlooking classic films and industry's mosttalented filmmakers has provided historians cause dispute.For example, Citizen Kane, which customarily places No. 1 onpolls greatest American films, was nominated 1941 forbest picture (there were 10 nominees those days), OrsonWelles' performance, direction and co-scripting HermanMankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, art direction, sound,music and editing.The only Oscar Citizen Kane was script. HowGreen Was My Valley was named best picture.Billy Wilder's classic comedy, Some Like It Hot, failed tobe nominated best picture, Chaplin's Modern Times,Hawks' Red River and Woody Allen's Manhattan.Oh, well. Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line SomeLike It Hot: Nobody's perfect.The Oscar statuette, one mostrecognizable images entertainment world, has no copyrightprotection, federal judge has ruled.The small Academy Award statue is part public domain,U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said ruling releasedThursday.The decision was setback Academy Motion PictureArts and Sciences, which had sued Chicago-based manufacturer ofan employee-incentive trophy similar Oscar.Academy President Karl Malden said ruling comes shockto me. The academy said it would appeal.The academy claimed that Star Award, trophy look-alikemade Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, dilutedthe academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.The Star Award depicted naked, muscular male much theOscar, just two inches shorter and holding star instead asword. It had gold finish similar Oscar, and stood acircular gold cap mounted cylindrical base.Although Waters acknowledged that Creative House trophy isvery similar Oscar, he rejected all academy'slegal claims, saying that statuette became part publicdomain prior Jan. 1, 1978, effective date CopyrightAct 1976.The film industry's top award was distributed firstceremony 1929 1941 c mark indicatinga copyright.The judge ruled, too, that Oscar not only was honoraryaward also was used promote film industry, and thereforedid not have limited purpose, required copyrightact.The academy noted that ruling applied only statuetteand that academy's trademark and service marks Oscarand Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.We are surprised that court would base its decision onevents which occurred half century ago, overlooking themeticulous fashion which Academy has protected integrityof its institutional symbol decades, Malden said astatement.Free enterprise has collided AcademyAwards, and everybody's trying pick pieces.With Oscar statuettes selling auction more $10,000and Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones,the National Academy Motion Picture Arts and Sciences isscrambling make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished byHollywood hucksterism.If you know infringement and fail object it, yourisk having your trademark become public domain, said Bruce Davis,the Academy's executive administrator, explaining lawsuitsthe organization has filed protect its beloved hunk ofelectroplated pewter.But Academy's crusade crass commercialism,this year's awards ceremony will feature new merchandisingwrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering most famous stars theOscar telecast will be equipped door-mounted coolers jammedwith Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.When limo doors swing open front Shrine Auditoriumand celebrities tumble out, Coke logo will be display infront audience that includes millions world.It seemed good marketing opportunity, said Coca-Colaspokesman Ira Gleser. The Academy approached our local bottler inLos Angeles and said we're going have lot thirsty people.But Academy embraces this new intrusion ofmerchandising, it has lashed out else it considers ablemishing Oscar name.When MGM-UA, distributor Rain Man, published newspaperadvertisements touting film's Oscar nominations thenominations were announced, Academy issued harshstatement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble. After adsappeared, Rain Man collected nine nominations.We regard this serious matter, and we have communicatedour concern, said Richard Kahn, president Academy.For nearly 50 years, Academy has maintained strict securityaround nominations and award winners. It also hasenvisoned statuette itself something icon.So auctioning Oscar has greatly distressed Academy.The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors monthlyentertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold seven Oscars thepast year, including best picture trophy 1951's AnAmerican Paris ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for1954's On Waterfront ($13,000) and black and whiteinterior decoration Oscar 1941's How Green Was My Valley($17,715).None were sold original recipients; heirs or friends whohad later received trophies put them block.When Malcolm Willits, book store's owner, announced that hewould hold February auction 1957 best-picture trophy forAround World 80 Days, Academy said enough, initiatinga court action that, now, has blocked any future trophy sales.The Academy insists that contract signed Oscar winnersmandates that they will not sell trophies first offeringthem Academy nominal fee.But now that word is out that these awards are worth$10,000 $50,000, people are reluctant sell them back theAcademy $10, Willits said.The Academy has created something great value here. This isthe most famous award world  most instantly recognizableaward. The Nobel Prize might be greater honor, people knowmore what Academy Award looks like.And they're very limited, too. There's not too many themaround. ... Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have movie poster inyour living room unless you were college student. Now, you can gointo Beverly Hills homes and there's movie poster, and darnthing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.When Academy won court order temporarily blocking futureauctions, Willits decided sell his store. It seemed be thefinal straw. I don't lawsuits, he said. I'm getting olderand I'd write movie scripts.Yet Academy has lost its most recent attempt itstrophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought againstthe Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 aCalifornia federal court.The Academy had claimed Lone Star Statuette, designed andbuilt Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was practicallyidentical Oscar. The court found otherwise.The motion picture industry's most covetedaward, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 statuetteshave been produced so far.Weighing 8{ pounds and standing 13{ inches tall, Oscar wascreated Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios art director Cedric Gibbons,who went win 11 trophies.Oscar, manufactured R.S. Owens Co., Chicago, is made ofBritannia metal, copper plate, nickel plate and gold plate. From1942 1944, trophy was made plaster, winners werelater presented real thing.According Academy Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,the only engraving mistake was 1938 when best actor trophygiven Spencer Tracy Boy's Town read: Best Actor: DickTracy.The Academy holds all rights statue and reservesthe right buy back Oscar someone takes it pawnshop, said Academy spokesman Bob Werden.The most-nominated film was All About Eve 1950. It got 14nominations. Ben-Hur 1959 was most-awarded film 11,and Walt Disney was most-awarded person 32.Oscar selection has come scrutiny filmstudios go new lengths pull votes out Academy MotionPicture Arts and Sciences.And flood Oscar vote enticements  free coffeemugs complimentary buffet dinners  Academy members areacknowledging that some Oscar voting is done committee, inviolation rules. Secretaries, spouses and friends, severalAcademy members say, are marking ballots what is supposed bethe entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition.It's local election judges, said Academy memberHarry Clein, who said he's witnessed team voting. A lot peopledon't know who candidates are. So they take look who'saround them and see what consensus is.As far elections go, it's not bad. But I've never beenthrough election Argentina.Dan Lyle, who oversees Oscar balloting accountingfirm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee thatAcademy members have actually filled out their ballots.All we know is that properly numbered ballot has beenreturned, he said. Members are honor system fill outthe ballot themselves.More 4,600 members were given ballots this year 61stAnnual Academy Awards, which will be telecast March 29 theShrine Auditorium Los Angeles. Academy members vote their areaof specialty. The Academy's actors branch, example, is onlygroup select nominees four acting categories.Since voting is done secretly  members do not sign theirballots  ballot's authenticity is ensured solely numericcontrol number, Lyle said. Ballots are invalidated only if there ismore one vote given category, and only votes thatspecific category are not tallied, he said.Nominations acting, directing, art direction and allspecialized categories are handled select branches and committeescomposed Academy members.All voting members Academy can participate bestpicture nominations and may vote final awards allcategories. Winners best documentary feature, best animatedshort film and best live-action short film are chosen only thosemembers who have seen all nominees.Academy constituent Julian Blaustein said that most hiscolleagues take voting very seriously. I don't vote (in acategory) if I'm not familiar pictures that category.... And I've never told someone vote film, when I'vedone some them.Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken,speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman. Although you'reasked vote nominations five pictures, I think lot ofpeople figure out that they have better chance if they just votefor their picture and leave other four blank, he said.Given tremendous impact Oscar nomination and Oscarvictory have film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising thata certain degree artifice might surround Oscars.The Last Emperor took $18.9 million, close half thefilm's gross, it won last year's best picture trophy. Morethan 70 percent revenues generated 1986's best picture,Platoon, came film was nominated. On average, bestpicture award is worth $20 million these days.A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted studio,therefore, can be good investment.

Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories. The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers. In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.  Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting. On average a best picture award is worth about $20 million, but there is no guarantee that Academy members actually complete their own ballots.Millions watch the awards presentation. The last awards show took a long three plus hours. The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character.

After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food.

Yet growing signs ferment East Germany have given Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government reason consider possibilities. Eduard Lintner, parliamentary speaker German affairs joint Christian Democrat and Christrian Socialist caucus Bundestag, said his committee has placed reunification its October agenda. He said sessions, which will include government officials and experts, hopefully can devise reunification models discuss West Germany's Western allies, particularly U.S. ""It has become clear world that Communist system East Germany is trouble,"" Mr. Lintner said. ""The time has come us show our allies, also reform-minded people East, that German reunification is no longer just theory subject requiring serious appraisal how it could come about."" ""There are still number imponderables,"" Mr. Linter conceded. ""For instance, we want federal government approach our allies and get their thoughts reunification topic."" The U.S. ambassador Bonn, Vernon A. Walters, earlier this month reaffirmed Washington's policy supporting German reunification based free, democratic elections. But Mr. Walters caused stir predicting that reunion could occur relatively future. Emerging opposition uncompromising Communist rule East Germany has raised questions how long East Berlin's leaders can resist democratic reforms sweeping neighboring East Bloc countries. Reforms Poland, Hungary and Soviet Union have magnified East Germany's Stalinist controls. Fledgling protest groups, and influential Protestant church, have begun pressing reforms East Germany which, if allowed include free elections, could eventually lead reunited Germany, according some Western experts. Dorothee Wilms, Bonn's cabinet minister inter-German affairs, said interview newspaper Welt am Sonntag that recent polls show that 85% and 90% all West Germans favor reunifed Germany. ""The desire reunification, feeling togetherness, sense nationhood -- all this has strongly increased recent years,"" Ms. Wilms told newspaper. ""The recent escape movement DDR makes especially clear that people German states want live free amongst themselves,"" she said, cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight. The first step, she added, ""is reform process DDR."" Most West German governments 1949 have paid only lip service reunification goal set preamble West Germany's constitution. Political realities have prevented topic becoming serious issue. Analysts say that four decades different systems would make reunification difficult. Further, many West German workers worry that mass influx East Germans could threaten their jobs. Thousands East Germans have emigrated West Germany Austro-Hungarian border Budapest ignored East Berlin's protests and opened its border. Close 80,000 East German refugees have arrived West Germany so far this year, either legally or escaping, and total more 100,000 are expected December.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.

54,d062j,"Insurers face prospect paying out billions dollars damages caused this week's California earthquake. Getting grip extent damages is proving far more difficult task what insurers faced Hurricane Hugo ripped Caribbean and Carolinas last month. The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far more easily observed damage hurricane, says George Reider, vice president Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claims division. But investors are betting that financial and psychological impact earthquake, coming so soon hurricane, will help stem more two years intense price-cutting wars business insurers. Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains. Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects help them assess structural damage. Most insurers already have mobilized their ""catastrophe"" teams begin processing claims their policyholders northern California. Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes fly claims adjusters Sacramento and then planned them drive Bay area. About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon, laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks. Some adjusters, already other parts California, drove disaster area recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used makeshift claims-processing centers. Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably radio -- that policyholders can call get assistance how submit claims. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., largest home and auto insurer California, believes losses earthquake could be somewhat less $475 million damages it expects pay out claims resulting Hurricane Hugo. State Farm, based Bloomington, Ind., is also largest writer personal-property earthquake insurance California. Earthquake insurance is sold separate policy or specific endorsement ""rider"" homeowner's policy California, because area's vulnerability earthquakes. State Farm said 25% its policyholders California have also purchased earthquake insurance. Allstate Insurance Co., unit Sears, Roebuck & Co., said 23% its personal property policyholders -- 28% San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage. The Association California Insurance Companies estimated damage residential property could total $500 million, only $100 million $150 million is insured, it said. Officials American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates efforts claims adjusters area natural disaster, will be flying San Francisco today. They expect have preliminary estimate damages day or two. Roads and bridges Bay area appear have suffered some most costly damage. Highways, such section Interstate 880 that collapsed Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage. Industry officials say Bay Bridge -- some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage, either, so cost repairing it probably would have be paid out state general operating funds. However, bridge, which charges $1 toll each way, does have ""loss income"" insurance replace lost revenue if operation bridge is interrupted more seven days. That coverage is provided syndicate insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based Philadelphia. Earthquake-related claims aren't expected cause significant financial problems insurance industry whole. Instead, liabilities two natural disasters recent weeks, analysts said total capital industry is likely be higher year end it was midyear. Indeed, earthquake could contribute turnaround insurance cycle couple ways. For example, insurers may seek limit their future exposure catastrophes increasing amount reinsurance they buy. Such increased demand reinsurance, losses reinsurers will bear these two disasters, are likely spur increases reinsurance prices that will later be translated overall price rise. Reinsurance is protection taken out insurance firms themselves.

His firm, some others, issued new buy recommendations insurer stocks yesterday.

Still, few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated. ""I think there is damned good chance someone is going hit skids this,"" said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult. He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance limit their exposure catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used Hurricane Hugo. British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing big claims San Francisco earthquake disaster. Although it's unclear how much exposure London market will face, U.K. underwriters traditionally have large reinsurance exposure U.S. catastrophe coverage. Jack Byrne, chairman Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates soar. The catastrophe losses sustained insurers this year will probably be worst inflation-adjusted basis 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked Great San Francisco Fire.

Analysts and industry spokesmen say only about 25-30% of homes in the San Francisco area have earthquake insurance.Insurers may have to pay billions of dollars for the earthquake.  The damage goes far beyond that of Hurricane Hugo last month.  Insurers are rushing into the area to process claims but no company is expected to suffer serious financial damage. Investors hope the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake will stem price-cutting wars between insurers the past two years. It is predicted that the quake damages may in fact lead to rate hikes. Insurers and state legislators are battling over rates and how they are set. Insurers as a whole are likely to increase the amount of reinsurance they buy, which will translate into an overall price rise.",,,,

In country where businesspractices are not overly genteel, this is tough combination achieve. Avast media circus, meanwhile, is quick expose any flaws.Sam Walton, founder Wal-Mart chain discount supermarkets who diedof cancer April, negotiated these pitfalls much better most. When,in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, thepaparazzi descended obscure corner Arkansas, mainly occupied bychicken farmers, where Walton made his home. What they found was happilymarried, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted atthe local Holiday Inn, and drove battered pick-up truck, twohub-caps. Folksy was understatement.Since then, some aspects Wal-Mart's business - its anti-union policies,the impact its Dollars 40bn annual sales hundreds Mom-and-Pop shops -have been subject critical scrutiny. So, extent, have lesswholesome adventures four Walton children. But no one has ever beenable make Sam himself look bad. The worst that has been said is that hewas rather dull.Walton is not dash anyone's illusions. Readers will either find hisautobiography lashed 'good ol common-sense and lot harmless, ifcharming, anecdotes. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makesno excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring most you,' he writes onestage, 'but one my best items ever was mattress pad called Bedmate .. . .'A few snippets are more revealing character. There cannot be manybillionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - andhave guts include photograph which demonstrates point.Meanwhile, competitive energy which Sam Walton applied his businessis inescapable. In one many contributions friends and family, DonSoderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells finding Sam oneSaturday morning his hand and knees local Kmart store, analysinghis rival's stock. And his wife, casual aside, notes that when thecouple was holiday Italy their luggage vanished while her husband wasoff similar scouting mission.But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhapscaptures entrepreneurial Walton spirit best. Explaining annualcontest which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' topromote, he recalls time Sam (who won) selected minnow bucketsfor carrying bait. Glass was more happily teamed apple juice. 'So Iwould go stores, and get them take that minnow bucket . . .put ice it, ice juice and give away samples out his minnowbucket. I particularly it stores I knew (Sam) was going visit. Itdrove him crazy, and he got that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'But reader can't help feeling that cosy yarns tell only half thetruth. Sam Walton was salesman core, and seems have packagedhimself all skill that he once applied selling gooey southernsweet called Moon Pies.For most part, this makes engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.Occasionally, it just grates. 'I had bought bank Bentonville, aboutabout Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, example, 'just little old bankwith only Dollars 3.5m deposits. But it helped me learn lot aboutfinancing things.' Oh, come Sam, is that whole story?The real truth, one suspects, comes right end book - whenWalton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have writtenthis book'. Given pleadings publishers - Doubleday paid Dollars4m manuscript - and rather natural desire have final say, hecan hardly be blamed agreeing write it. But these are unlikely becircumstances which make most critical self-analysis. At end ofthe day, Sam Walton's heritage is shopping malls, not bookstores.The store manager Wal-Mart thiscommunity outskirts Dallas tells story that gives aninsight man considered responsible retailingphenomenon.Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when secretarytelephoned Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters inBentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was land nearbyairport and secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bringhim De Soto store.Paying unexpected calls stores is one way Walton has kept inclose touch everyday goings-on. His example is followed byother Wal-Mart executives and most make point spending lot oftime field.Says Ed Nagy, district manager 9 stores Dallasmetropolitan area, It's not `Uh-oh, someone's coming,'because they're always out.By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operationsthroughout company.Everyone, Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating OfficerDavid Glass hourly store worker, can readily quote thegospel according Sam, he is called.To paraphrase Sam's primary rules retailing, Rule No.1 isthe customer is always right. Rule No.2 says just case thecustomer's wrong, revert rule No.1.If principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they arebecause that's way Sam is, people who know him say.He shuns limelight that his company's success has shed himand has decided refuse almost all press requests interviews.He's happy chat folks his stores, though.He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart associates thathospitality customers is crucial. He preaches it person or viahigh-tech satellite hookup his stores.Wal-Mart employees became known associates companyeffort prove it cared employees, partly thwart unionorganizing effort late 1960s.One most sensitive subjects Walton is fortune he'samassed.A close associate says Sam would probably give anything notto be named Fortune magazine's list country's wealthiestpeople. The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stakein Wal-Mart stock is worth $6.8 billion.Sam Walton is more interested his backhand he is hisbank account, says Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.Samuel Moore Walton turns 71 March 29. He was born inKingfisher, Okla., and grew son farm-mortgage banker.He graduated University Missouri economicsdegree 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. management trainee inDes Moines, Iowa. After serving three years Army, he went toArkansas and opened Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventuallybecoming company's biggest franchisee.The seeds Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and hisbrother James L., or Bud, opened first Wal-Mart Discount City in1962. The rest will probably earn entry history U.S.retail trade.Bud is senior vice president and board member Wal-Mart.Three four grown children Sam and his wife Helen had areinvolved company various capacities.Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis much asever, and is said not suffer effects bout withleukemia, now remission. He spends less time office sincehanding most responsiblities David Glass. Sam is stillchairman board.Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourishwithout Sam. The answer is emphatic yes because, he says, Wehave great people. The Walton family will always be involved, headds.Commenting future, Glass says: We'll be judged whatwe produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done won'tmatter.Wal-Mart founder Sam Waltonpitched help check-out clerks his store this FloridaPanhandle city when electronic glitch shut cashregisters.The 71-year-old Walton, considered be one world'srichest people, grabbed note pad Tuesday evening and startedhand-writing merchandise prices customers so their bills couldbe tallied calculators quickly.People began recognizing him and coming and greeting him,said store manager Paul Sively.

Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pagesMany people might be said be personification American Dream;few are better qualified that title Sam Walton.Walton is character it would be difficult invent, all-American boywho became one world's most successful businessmen. The church-goingson farmer born 1918 Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded storechain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly hisdeath 1992, became world's biggest retailer.His company, Wal-Mart, made sales Dollars 55bn last year, and afterWalton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four childrenheld them second-largest fortune world - Dollars 23.5bn.What is most startling Wal-Mart is speed its growth. AlthoughWalton built small chain Ben Franklin variety store franchises from1945, it was not 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discountstore.At time its incorporation 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets withsales Dollars 44m - not enough earn place trade journal DiscountMerchandiser's list 71 biggest US discount retailers. Ten yearslater, 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only 33rd-biggestretailer US. Its turnover was only 9 cent that SearsRoebuck, biggest, and 11 cent K mart, second-biggest. Withinanother 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.Apart Walton's autobiography completed shortly his death,however, published material company is curiously scarce. This bookattempts fill gap, provide 'scholarly account' rise ofWal-Mart, setting it wider context US retailing, and explaininghow it was achieved.One strength authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability copy and adaptfrom other retailers.Sam Walton not invent discount retailing. Rather, he realised threatdiscounting posed his variety store business and studied depthmany US's leading discounters early 1960s, including Ann andHope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.Walton learned them all, was unique taking his discount storesinto small towns few thousand people, where shoppers used travellinglong distances were delighted have cut-price store nearby sellingeverything they needed.Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness technology. As early the1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought asmall aircraft pilot stores himself - something he continued todo end his life.Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant invest technology, and had bepersuaded colleagues introduce computers, and scanning check-outs -long most retailers had recognised their importance - and investDollars 20m internal satellite communications system. This technologyhelped Wal-Mart build one most efficient distribution systems anyretailer. But perhaps most fundamental reason its success, booksuggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive managementstructure.Regional vice-presidents based group headquarters Bentonville,Arkansas, rather costly regional offices, are despatched everyMonday aircraft their regions, spend week visiting stores, workingwith staff and managers, and return day-long merchandising meetingevery Friday.They discuss results, problems and suggestions week 7.30ammeeting Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers torelate results. District managers hold conference call theirstore managers, and day is out, contents meeting havebeen communicated all store department heads.The system means employees can make suggestions vice-presidents one weekand, if idea is accepted Saturday meeting, see its implementationbegin week.Even world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however. One wasWalton's decision stand chairman and chief executive's rolein 1974 favour Ronald Mayer, only return roles 1976after finding he was incapable letting go reins. Another wasWal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big forgigantist America.Then there was Walton's rash promise do 'hula dance' Wall Street ifWal-Mart achieved 8 cent pre-tax profit margin 1984. It did, andhe did.The book also covers well debate whether Wal-Mart's impact theeconomies small US towns was positive or negative.If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quitecaptures sheer excitement working world's fastest-growingretailer. Moreover, it makes little attempt predict whether Wal-Mart cancontinue its growth, and conquer rest world way itconquered US.But this is well-researched and accessible account one man's success inbuilding his American dream.He's ranked richest man thenation leading business magazine, folks Bentonville,a town 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.He's just part community, said Curt Loyd, executivedirector Bentonville Chamber Commerce. He's neatperson. He calls Bentonville home, and that is special us.Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Martstores trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is againshunning publicity his third consecutive ranking theworld's top billionaires. According Forbes magazine's July 24edition, Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, upfrom its 1988 estimate $6.5 billion.He is unavailable, said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle thesilver-haired founder nation's third-largest retail chain,based Bentonville, 150 miles northwest Little Rock.Shinkle said he received 10 calls reporters Mondaymorning, when Forbes list appeared newspapers. Shinkle saidnews coverage Walton sets press frenzy forcomments him. But 71-year-old businessman declined tocomment.He feels any attention Sam Walton is individual andhe prefers attention Sam Walton (the founder of) company,Shinkle said.He very seldom schedules interviews his feelings. It justputs him position he doesn't want be.But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personalmodesty. Just 1987 stock market crash, which Walton'sfamily-owned chunk Wal-Mart stock lost millions value, hequipped response questions news conference anothertopic that it was only paper. Walton then changed subject.Walton was first listed Forbes nation's richest man inOctober 1985. Three years ago, Forbes also began listing world'swealthiest people. Walton made that listing richest Americanevery year since. This year he ranks third, two Japanesebusinessmen.Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many more than1,400 stores operated company he started singlefive-and-dime Rogers more two decades ago. He is out theoffice four days week, spokesman said.He spends most his time talking associates andcustomers, Shinkle said, and he always comes back manyideas them.Wal-Mart calls its sales help associates instead employees.When Walton first made Forbes list richest Americans,recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came infrom all billionaire Ozarks.They wanted know stock and company, saidSimpson, who works Stephens Inc.

It has branch inOrlando.The company's loss adjusters are area trying estimate losses.Their guess is that losses be faced all insurers may total more thanDollars 8bn.Not all damaged property area is insured and there have beenestimates that storm caused more Dollars 20bn damage.However, other insurers have estimated that losses could be low asDollars 1bn total.Mr Robertson said: 'No one knows this time what exact loss is'.WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc large parts southernFlorida and Louisiana this week, grade two dollar crisis (on one-to-fourscale, four being most severe) was blowing itself out end atumultuous few days US and world financial markets.On Wall Street, most damage currency storm was inflicted aweek ago Friday and Monday, when bond yields jumped sharplyand Dow Jones industrial average plunged more 75 points.The flimsy walls erected hastily Federal Reserve and other bigcentral banks protect vulnerable dollar tidal wave sellingon foreign exchange markets failed hold; and sellers pouredthrough breached barricades, currency dropped DM1.40. This wasits lowest-ever point D-mark.The conditions necessary dollar crisis had been building incurrency markets some time. Interest rate differentials US andGermany widened summer Fed eased, and Bundesbanktightened, their respective monetary policies.The failure US economy climb out recession any vigour wasalso making overseas investors increasingly unhappy holding thedollar.So, too, was political hole President Bush had dug himself are-election battle that only year ago was supposed be shoo-in theincumbent.Moreover, fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was themarkets trying prop dollar served only convince foreignexchange dealers that currency was heading one direction  - down.While there were plenty reasons dealers sell dollar, thelogic such strongly negative reaction bond and stock markets wasless obviously compelling.There are two standard explanations why weak dollar prompts bond prices tofall. The first is that it raises import prices and, result, adds toinflationary pressures.The second is that it makes it hard Fed engineer another cut ininterest rates stimulate flagging recovery, and raises thepossibility that rates may actually have go protect currency.The first explanation is not particularly convincing - imports account fornot much more 10 cent US gross domestic product, so higherimport prices do not greatly effect overall price level, which is nowaround 3 cent and heading lower.The second explanation carries more weight. Although there is not muchchance, given present economic and political climate, that Fed willraise rates help dollar, there is little doubt that currency'sweakness makes it extremely difficult Fed ease monetary policyagain.The fear that Fed may be done interest rate cuts presenteconomic cycle was also selling equity markets. But investorsin stocks were equally, if not more, troubled rise bond yields.Just week ago, yield benchmark 30-year bond, which hasremained stubbornly high all year poor state economy,looked if it might drop 7.3 cent.The dollar put paid those hopes and, middle this week, it wasapproaching 7.45 cent, putting upward pressure all-importantmortgage rate home-buyers.The dollar was not only story financial markets this week, and thedevastating effect Hurricane Andrew produced typically hard-eyed,although nonetheless logical, reaction Wall Street.The stocks those insurance companies greatest exposure insouthern Florida, area hit worst hurricane, all took tumble.But relatively modest losses Geico, Travelers and Progressivesuggested that market believed insurers were reserved or reinsuredadequately enough cover hurricane-related claims.The flip side hurricane's coin was strong showing stocksof home construction companies expected benefit demand forrebuilding damaged or destroyed homes.

Quayle exhorted, crowderupted cheers.The 41-year-old nominee delivered speech calmself-assurance, sticking close his text and avoiding hispenchant extemporaneous remarks  perhaps another result theunanticipated controversy.Bush, who followed his running mate podium, said he wasproud have Dan Quayle my side. The two will stress theunity their ticket they campaign together this weekendthrough Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.But optimistic words was unsettling undercurrentthat threatened Quayle's candidacy just it was launched.Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi  who worked Quayle'sgrandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, managing editor TheIndianapolis News  said he contacted National Guard behalfof Quayle when young man applied 1969 and recommended himvery highly, News reported.Quayle, hardliner defense matters, has said he sought guardduty so he could attend law school. A Bush aide said matter wasdiscussed Indiana senator process that led tohis selection Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that heused influence gain admittance Guard.Bush aides said no thought had been given dropping Quaylefrom ticket, some Republicans suggested. Quayle was tenseand refused answer reporters' questions topic abrief walk-through convention hall.It was daunting change senator, whose youthful vigor,rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have beencompared those John F. Kennedy.Quayle alluded National Guard issue his speech,saying he was proud six years he served. He also addressedhis relative anonymity: Many this week have asked, `Who is DanQuayle?' The people Indiana know me and now nation will.Those who addressed convention his behalf also pulled outtheir ammunition. Sen. Bob Dole Kansas, who placed Quayle's namein nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought deflectconcerns that he lacked experience job.He's already spent 12 years congressman and senator. ...That is 12 more years national experience Michael Dukakis,and he is running president, Dole said.Sen. Alan Simpson Wyoming, one those who seconded thenomination, said Quayle would bring vim, vigor and vitality tothe party and would bring sparks and voltage this campaign.Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start nationalticket remains be seen. Others, notably Democratic vicepresidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro 1984, found they couldnot.But Quayle, ever upbeat, was determined Thursday night not bedaunted prospect. Miracles do happen, he told his party.Dan Quayle has not been nominated forvice president and already Republicans are comparing him ThomasJefferson and John F. Kennedy.Sen. John Warner Virginia, who served Quayle Senatesubcommittee, told audience that whenever he heard Indianasenator speak, I'd say, `there stands next ThomasJefferson.'And, added Warner, he does have same fire his belly asour great forefather Thomas Jefferson Virginia.Former president Gerald Ford made comparison Kennedy, aDemocrat.In 1960, American people voted John F. Kennedy forpresident and he was relatively same age Dan Quayle, saidFord. John Kennedy had been House and Senate 14 yearsbefore he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years.What Quayle thinks those references isn't known. But hedoesn't it when people say he looks movie idol RobertRedford.Whether, indeed, he looks Redford seems be eye ofthe beholder. In parlance politics, it's issue. They areboth male. They are blond.The so-called resemblance became point contention the1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage. The actor, who onceplayed role presidential office seeker TheCandidate sent Quayle telegram telling him stop thelook-alike references his congressional campaign literature.Quayle said news media had made comparison, not he, andafter he was elected sent Redford autographed picture himself.And this week, he told reporters he considered so-calledRedford look stigma.

But he does it and loves it.The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoonafter George Bush announced he wants 41-year-old Indianasenator be Republican nominee vice president.Those who have known Quayles years said senator andhis wife have remained relatively unchanged their years inpublic life.Dan and Marilyn Quayle met law students Indianapolis,married while they were still school and remain close many oftheir friends that period.One greatest things him is job being asenator has not changed him bit, said Indianapolis attorneyWilliam R. Neale, treasurer Quayle's 1986 re-election campaign.He's same nice guy he was law school.Neale, who grew Marilyn Tucker Quayle Indianapolis,introduced Dan Quayle his future wife student gathering atthe Indiana University law school early 1970s.Dan Quayle, who grew Huntington, graduated DePauwUniversity, small liberal arts college Greencastle, Ind.,before going work Indiana attorney general's office in1970.Daniel F.

Benjamin wasambiguous he thought Secret Service agents might be able tohelp him tests school, Mrs. Quayle said.Corinne didn't prospect having her father spend moretime away home, Quayle said.She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks BobDole,' said Quayle.Here is transcript speech Sen.Bob Dole Kansas nominating Sen.

He helped get unitset up. (But) it would not have been 1971, Smith saidFriday telephone interview. We formally began operationsJuly 1.Quayle conceded Friday that resume entry was inaccurateand said his staff had written document.If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I didn't hold thatjob two years, Quayle told reporters his campaignplane.Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called therevelation error The Plain Dealer Cleveland cheapshot.Quayle was hired entry-level research assistant thestate Attorney General's office 1970 he returned sixmonths basic and advanced training Indiana NationalGuard.Quayle, 1969 graduate DePauw University, was attendingIndiana University Law School time.M. Stanton Evans, then editor Indianapolis News,helped arrange his job interview state. Evans worked forEugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher News.At no point any this Dan Quayle ask any favors oruse any influence, said Evans, now National JournalismCenter Washington, D.C.He wouldn't have been hired chief investigator. He washired entry-level job and was promoted whole bunch ofjobs his merits. It's nothing story, Evans said.Theodore Sendak, Attorney General time, recently hadsurgery and is unable comment, according his son, TimothySendak.Patricia Gifford, Marion Superior Court judge who was then anassistant attorney general, said Friday that prior theestablishment Consumer Protection Division, all complaintsand inquiries were handled me. The legal assistant assigned tome and utilized my chief investigator was Dan Quayle. Herstatement was released Quayle campaign.The Consumer Protection Division was created statelegislature resolve complaints defective products, falseclaims ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud.In 1980, Quayle referred himself Vietnam-era veteranin campaign literature when he was running three-termincumbent Birch Bayh Senate race.Quayle, who enlisted Indiana National Guard, dropped thereference objections some Vietnam combat veterans.In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he was onactive duty several periods his tenure Guard.The statement referred periods when Quayle was basic trainingand 15 days camp each summer.Dan Quayle is likely be man theoutside George Bush's White House vice presidentialcandidacy that began furor settled obscurity, expertssay.Encumbered his image political novice who needed bevyof professional handlers survive early campaign controversies,Quayle enters Bush administration which he has few intimates orallies.Relegated campaign small towns and safe GOP areas,Quayle vice president is likely be given traditionalceremonial role  going political gatherings and state funerals rather advisory role that Walter Mondale and Bush had,some scholars feel.Dan Quayle is going set vice presidency back adecade or more. One thing that political scientists have beentalking is just how much vice presidency has grown. ...With Quayle, it's just going retreat old days politicsand funerals, said Ryan Barilleaux, professor politicalscience Miami University Oxford, Ohio, who studies theAmerican presidency.Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate thecampaign. When asked, Bush employed stock lines that Quaylewould make outstanding vice president and had been temperedby steel he weathered early furor his militaryservice, academic record and personal life.The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access tothe same papers, information and intelligence that is available tothe president. But he would go no further describing whatassignments he would give Quayle.Quayle says Bush has talked him heading space council,and that he assumes he'll have role administration'santi-drug efforts. I will be very close adviser thepresident, Quayle said.But that's not way everyone sees it.Both Bush and Mondale came their vice presidential campaignswith substantial reputations and were able place key staffers inimportant positions respective presidential campaigns,Barilleaux notes.Dan Quayle has contributed nothing way staff theBush campaign. He doesn't have his big reputation CapitolHill. ... Dan Quayle has no friends Bush White House exceptGeorge Bush, Barilleaux says.They're going give him lot window dressing, spacecouncil, drug task force, he's going be man outside... not man who's going be consulted crisis, apro forma basis.But Eddie Mahe Jr., GOP consultant who worked Bushcampaign, says Bush is likely give Quayle more active role inthe administration he had campaign.Vindication demands that. Both them will want prove howright decision was, Mahe says.Democrats portrayed Quayle campaign lightweight,a man little or no legislative accomplishments, untested andunqualified be heartbeat away presidency. Even somemembers Quayle's party were dismayed Bush's choice.Quayle didn't help his case making number celebratedgaffes campaign, perhaps worst being his garbledexplanation Holocaust and his declaration, I didn't live inthis century.Norman Ornstein, American Enterprise Institute, saysQuayle, while not world's leading intellectual, is not acomplete dummy. He was simply thrust situation which hewas unprepared, Ornstein says.I think he's immature. He's not stupid, Ornstein says.But Quayle comes White House very damagingstereotype that's developed him that's widely believed thepolitical community and that's believed large segment theelectorate, Ornstein says.That's going give him good deal overcome. It's going togive him enormous impetus prove himself. That's going bedifficult, given office.Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess Brookings Institution seeparallels Quayle's vice presidency and those Richard Nixon andSpiro Agnew. The choice Nixon was viewed move DwightEisenhower appease party's right wing, and Agnew was seen asa political nonentity.The natural response is use him (Quayle) sparingly, Nixondid Agnew 1968, Hess says. However, Quayle has fouryears prove himself, and I think you're going see stories intwo years how much he's learned, how much he's actedresponsibly, how far he's come campaign 1988.Quayle admits campaign was learning process. After thecontroversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence hisBush handlers, saying he would be his man. He became moreaccessible media continued adhere schedulehanded Washington and deliver party's scriptedmessage. Soon, he dropped front pages.And although he occasionally spoke out frustration havinglittle control his schedule and ceasing make nationalnews, he played role loyal No. 2 and trumpeted his newanonymity.We have arrived being traditional vice presidentialnominee because we are either back pages or either not thepages all.

Quayle was viewed as a lightweight and questions wereraised about his military service and errors in his official resume. Hismain attributes were party loyalty and identification as a devoted familyman.  Quayle contributed little to the campaign and, after being elected,all but disappeared from the political scene.

His friends,especially in his home town, called him a winner.","George Bush's choice of Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate,surprised most political observers.  Despite service in Congress andSenate, he was looked upon as lacking the experience and mettle for avigorous national campaign.  Several Republican senators rallied support.Senator John Warner of Virginia compared Quayle to Thomas Jefferson.Senator Bob Dole in nominating Quayle at the Republican Convention, calledhim a dedicated public servant and devoted family man and cited his supportfor the Reagan program.Devotion to family and friends was a theme voiced by those who had knownQuayle for many years. Relatives and friends believed that if Quayle wereelected, he and his family would remain a strong unit.Questions arose regarding Quayle's fitness for the job, and there were somesuggestions that he should withdraw.  He had called himself a ""Vietnam-eraveteran"" which angered some actual combat veterans.  Quayle's service was in the National Guard, a position he apparently gained through familyinfluence.  Quayle's resume contained a reference to a position held inIndiana, two years before it was created.Quayle survived these criticisms but did not play a strong role in thecampaign or as vice president.
