0,d116i,"Five astronauts board Discovery today for a second try at send the hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time. Astronomers be start to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish, say Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activities. Air Force forecasters say there be a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launch the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT. more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen be pump into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight. The astronauts, wear bright orange flight suits, climb into the crew cabin just as dawn be break over the Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have, say William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program. It's go to change our perspective altogether. I can't say what we're go to learn, but I'll be astound if we don't learn many new things. Discovery be aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the high a shuttle have ever gone, so the telescope can be place in its proper orbit far above Earth's distort atmosphere. It be the 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, which journey into space next month with the Astro observatory, sit on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads have be occupied; the first be in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion. Hubble have be wait to take its place in space since 1983, delay by technical problems and the Challenger accident. The late postponement occur April 10, when Discovery's launch be scrub four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle. The mood at the Kennedy Space Center be considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of astronomers gather with their families. The day after launch, mission specialist Steven a. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops. Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days until after its lens cap be opened, expose the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Hubble be not expect to start provide scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA say it will release its first image an open star cluster in the constellation Carina a week after launch. In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million have be spend on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument. The european Space Agency contribute $250 million for 15 percent of the view time. NASA estimate it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space. During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times good resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light have be travel toward Earth for 14 billion years. Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe be create 15 billion years ago as believe and uncover some of the mystery surround galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also be expect to shed light on how and when the universe might end. The telescope be name for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discover during the 1920s that the universe be expanding. His work give rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe be create by a tremendous explosion. In addition to Hubble, Discovery carry a human skull fill with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive. It be the skull's third trip into space. The shuttle be to end its five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronauts return Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrate payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery be schedule to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. We feel very confident that things be go to go well this time, say Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're go to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep try until we do. That's kind of the name of the game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach say Sunday that the countdown be proceed smoothly and the shuttle appear to be in perfect condition. The countdown get under way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit force the first launch attempt to be scrub four minutes before liftoff April 10. The unit be replace with a new one, which test show to be fine. Hopefully, we'll get the shuttle off the pad this time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance of favorable weather be expect at launch time, with low clouds be the main concern, say the Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front from the north be expect to pass through the area by Monday night. The outlook be considerably better for Wednesday and Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronauts arrive from Johnson Space Center in Houston early Sunday afternoon, the shuttle Columbia be be transport to a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery. It be only the second time both shuttle launch pads at Kennedy Space Center have be occupy simultaneously. The first time be in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lift off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand say he do not believe the National Aeronautics and Space Administration be move too fast with his shuttle. NASA expect to launch Columbia with an astronomical observatory call Astro no early than May 16, one week later than plan because of Discovery's two-week delay. In some cases, it could be a problem have shuttles on both launch pads, Brand said. In this particular case, everything's fit together. NASA have until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground. After that, all launch attempts must be halt for eight days so hubble's batteries can be recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble from the time it be disconnect from Discovery's electrical system until its two energy-collecting solar panels take over in space. Discovery's payload bay be seal late Saturday night, drastically reduce the risk of contamination to the telescope's finely polish 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the high a shuttle have ever gone, so the telescope can be place in its proper orbit far above Earth's distort atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey through space, astronomers expect to look back to nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most perplexing mysteries. Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble and thus provide additional targets for the telescope. The $100 million observatory also will focus during Columbia's nine-day mission on Comet Austin, believe to be on its first trip through the solar system. Both Hubble and Astro be schedule for launch in 1986, but be delay by the Challenger accident. The hubble Space Telescope be awaken from its self-induced sleep today but it be still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments be on hold, unable to begin any observations. We be out of the `safe-mode' right now, say Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers control the telescope. He say the telescope be run on a normal control-all mode, where its own computers and sensors guide where it be pointing. Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, pack their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, make some last-minute observations of Earth and talk with ground-based reporters about their flight. Pilot Charles Bolden say he be especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which be expect eventually to look back 14 billion light years nearly to the birth of the universe. It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who have never hear of the hubble Space Telescope, say Bolden. It make little kids' eyes light up. It make little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science. The telescope's big eye have remain open, but Hubble have be in a safe mode with all motion stop because of early problems in link the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite. The antennas be the primary links for relay scientific data to the ground. Terry say that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope read telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be play to Earth and analyze when the antennas be work properly. We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, he said. Engineers be able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system be not useful for scientific data, which must be transmit at a high rate of speed. We're put the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode, he said. shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., complete a series of commands that take the telescope out of its safe mode and then begin to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health. It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope be operate the way it be suppose to at this point in the startup process, say hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're back up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems, Olivier say Friday. This be not the time to do anything dumb. The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deploy it earlier this week be stick to their schedule. Landing be schedule for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers be keep a close watch on the weather. Winds be predict to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph. Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown. The shuttle carry enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awaken the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by play the song, Cosmos. Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today, say Commander Loren Shriver. The song be select in honor of hubble Space Telescope, which be now open for business, say Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronauts be to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home. They also plan to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center. Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden be to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets be ready for return to earth. The crew deploy Hubble on Wednesday but they have stay close to the telescope in case there be trouble open the aperture door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan be prepare to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth. But that prove unnecessary when the door be open Friday morning, expose the telescope's finely polish 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time. Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stop work when the door opened, but engineers later get them back on line. The gyroscopes be knock out by the motion and that, too, keep the telescope in the safe mode, say Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, say Hubble's systems be set at conservative limits for the first operations and that cause many malfunctions. There also be two communications outages total several hours. Hubble be design with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbit communications system be lose for extend periods, Terry said. NASA have plan to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, show an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. But Terry say that would be delay because of the antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month or two. The telescope, name for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe. The universe be believe to have be create about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion. Hubble provide the basis for the big-bang theory of creation. He discover during the 1920s that the universe be expand and that the farther the galaxy be from Earth, the faster it be move away. After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the hubble Space Telescope be free from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glint in the sunlight, drift into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds. Mission specialist Steven Hawley release Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in get one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled. The first of NASA's great observatories be now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really look great as we fly away from it, and we sure hope it do good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver say later. The $1.5 billion telescope be release at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle enter its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned. The shuttle then back away. Thank you very much for the ride, say Mike Harrington, director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan have be in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel. That prove to be unnecessary. Close but no cigar, but good for the Hubble that it go the way it did, Sullivan said. She and McCandless have train for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission. The first solar array unreel from its mast at midday Wednesday as the shuttle pass 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, above South America's eastern coast. It start provide power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise have only eight hours of charge. Deployment of the starboard panel, however, be more troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latches be first released, then move about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stop again. A third attempt roll the panel out all the way. Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley begin the long process of release Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasp it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoist the 12{-ton telescope high above the shuttle. Hubble be take off shuttle electrical power just before it be lift out of the cargo bay and be operate on its own nickel-hydrogen batteries. At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble be now on its own internal power, Carr said. The game have begun. The race be on. The clock be ticking. Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starve for electricity ease after the first solar panel be stretch out. Television cameras aboard Discovery show the first array as it be pull from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflect off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope. Discovery be 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle have ever flown. The orbit be dictate by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distort atmosphere. Discovery's five astronauts be awe by the view. I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure look far away today, Shriver say of Hawley. Astronomers have wait seven years for hubble to take its place in space. The telescope originally be schedule for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion push it back. The mission be delay another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery force the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's schedule liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blast into space, transport hubble out of this world and in search of others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door be to be open Friday, expose the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Discovery be follow Hubble in case the door do not open properly. If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepare once again to walk in space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, say the telescope would be test Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door be opened. We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the hubble by put the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said. The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments. If all go well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expect to release its first image from the telescope of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina on Tuesday. Data will follow in a month or two. Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, study stars and galaxies so distant their light have be travel to Earth for 14 billion years. They expect to determine precisely how and when the universe be formed, currently estimate at 15 billion years ago. The telescope be name for the late american astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discover during the 1920s that the universe be expanding. He also be responsible for help to form the Big Bang theory of creation. Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally make contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after try for more than six hours to lock on. Applause erupt in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that mar Hubble's first full day in space be solved. We have confirmation that we have achieve communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, say NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers have say all along they believe the antennas be work all right and that the problem be in incorrectly point either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that act as a switchboard. In the successful attempt, they nearly double the width of the antennas' beam to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees. The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slow rate and can be use in emergencies, be work well. Space shuttle Discovery be 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems. The outage be not a problem for which space walkers would have be summoned. The five astronauts be otherwise busy make pictures of storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and do experiments. Steve Terry, director of a team calibrate various aspects of the telescope, say the first outage be cause by human error and be not a serious problem. It begin between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and last 45 minutes to an hour, he said. The second failure occur at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempt to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS. This time it be a pointing problem, say Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman. It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience deal with it be the cause. The telescope, embark on a 15-year search for new worlds, be release from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost send two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awaken the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite. good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that song, say Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There be a lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble have a good night while you be asleep. We appreciate the good words from everybody, reply Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently back Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one complete this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble. The telescope really look great as we fly away from it, and we sure hope it do good work, Shriver say Wednesday. Well, it sure be now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo be real proud of you. Scientists have hail the Hubble NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft as the great advance in astronomy since Galileo raise a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago. Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble be operate properly, such as respond to directional commands. The next milestone be Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door be to be opened, expose the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. then on Tuesday, NASA expect to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. Data will follow in a month or two. If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik say the telescope would be test today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door be opened. We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the hubble by put the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley use the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay. One of the telescope's solar arrays unreel from its mast as expect and start provide power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise have only eight hours of charge. But there be trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge when the latches be released, and then move about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stop again. The panel roll all the way out on the third attempt. By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan be in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from take tools in hand and go on an outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik say the cause of the problem be unknown. The 8{-hour procedure be perform 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle have ever flown. The orbit be dictate by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distort atmosphere. Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, study stars and galaxies so distant their light have take 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to determine how and when the universe be formed, currently estimate at 15 billion years ago. The telescope originally be schedule for launch in 1983 but be delay by technical problems and the Challenger accident. Discovery, which blast into orbit Tuesday, be schedule to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven years late, the hubble Space Telescope be where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have be form at the beginning of time. Less than five hours after it ride into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope send its first test radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupt in Mission Control in Houston. As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect, say astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space. Discovery, trail an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carry the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth high by 70 miles than any previous shuttle. There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time. Our window on the universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exult as the Discovery rise off its seaside launch pad. It's a beautiful day to have hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's be for so many years, say NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's in its element and I'm delighted. The telescope be suppose to be launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delay its deployment. It suffer a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown be stop at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle. While it remain on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness. In its first day in space, that checkout and test continue remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. On hand to watch the Discovery launching be a contingent of scientists who have hail the Hubble as the great advance in astronomy since Galileo raise a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago. truly refer to the early-day astronomer when he be ask about the long delays in get the telescope to its work station. Somebody the other day said, `who remembers the day that Galileo pick up his telescope to look at the stars?' say Truly, a former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matter that we do it right. The telescope be 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it fly free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side. It be name after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorize that the universe be expand and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it be traveling. That give support to the theory that a massive explosion the Big Bang create the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago. The Hubble be expect to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old be the universe? How big be it? The telescope have two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the other 12 inches. Two of the instruments be cameras, two be spectrometers and one be a photometer. In addition, the fine pointing system act as a sixth instrument by provide precise measurement of distances. On Wednesday, Hawley be to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and after a long checkout drop it overboard to orbit on its own. In the cargo bay, the telescope receive electrical power from the shuttle. But the juice be cut when the instrument be lift out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels be extend to receive light from the sun. Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be stand by, partially dress in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually. Discovery's launch be not without its problems. With 31 seconds leave in the countdown, the computer that run the final moments before liftoff refuse to close a fuel valve and stop the launch process. The problem be overcome and the shuttle lift off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late. The shuttle be schedule to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California. On the way uphill, as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the shuttle's windshield be splatter with several flecks of things. He say the windshield be streak by the debris and that it also be smear when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit. The astronauts also have problems with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thrusters be inoperative. Neither problem be consider serious. The shuttle that put the hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carry an instrument use in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once be the world's most powerful telescope. It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolize Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan say Friday as she circle the Earth in space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope be carry into orbit by Sullivan. After she bring the eyepiece back to Earth, it will be place on display at the observatory. It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy, say Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the Mount Wilson Institute. The pasadena-based group run the observatory, locate in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. The discoveries make by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson give us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe, McAfee said. We believe the hubble Space Telescope will do the same thing. The Hooker Telescope be the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope be place in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego. use the Hooker Telescope, Hubble be the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute say in a statement. This crucial discovery provide the first definite proof that other galaxies exist far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy, the institute said. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant use the Hooker telescope to take thousands of photograph of faint galaxies, show that most of them be move away from each other very quickly. This provide observational evidence for the concept, suggest by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe be expanding, the institute said. Hubble's work help convince scientists the universe be create in a giant explosion, call the big bang, an estimate 15 billion years ago. The Hooker Telescope be mothball in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move. The institute hop to obtain funds to reopen it.

The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.

1,d113h,"INDIA suffer a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroy two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of Calcutta, kill at least 45 people and injure scores of others. Police say a bomb explode in the crowded trade and residential district of Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, cause two blocks of flats to collapse and trap up to 70 people in the rubble. The identity of the bombers be unknown but the explosion come just five days after over 250 people be kill and at least 1,200 injure in a series of bomb attacks aim at the heart of the indian business capital of Bombay. A militant Sikh group fight for independence for the indian state of Punjab have claim responsibility for the Bombay blasts, but police be unconvinced, say they be carry out by a foreign group in connivance with 'local criminals'. In what many interpret as a reference to Pakistan, with whom India have fight three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, tell parliament in New Delhi that he suspect 'an international conspiracy.' most of the estimated 125 people live in the Calcutta flats be in their beds when the blast occurred, set fire to both buildings, accord to officials in the city's central control room. At least 45 people be dead on arrival at hospital, they said. last Friday a series of car bombs explode in Bombay in what the government describe as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart. Among the targets be the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport. The attacks in Calcutta and Bombay be a severe setback to attempt to heal the wounds create by recent intercommunal violence, which have cause deep shock throughout India. more than 2,000 people die in riots, include over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6. Some fear the wave of bomb attacks be design to stir a renewal of communal strife and undermine efforts by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. last night national and local state leaders appeal for calm in an attempt to prevent a renew outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urge the nation to ignore rumours after the 'inhuman and criminal blast'. A ROW have erupt between the Bombay stock exchange, India's large stock market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books. The Sebi have accuse stockbrokers of flout the exchange's rules, include regulations on margin trading design to limit the risk of members default through excessive speculative investments. It have also accuse the exchange authorities of fail to enforce rules and of poor administration. The stock exchange deny the allegations, say they be 'baseless, make out of context and blow out of proportion.' The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market where, as measure by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares have fall 48 per cent from their peak early last year, include a 320 points fall since the government's budget be announce two weeks ago. yesterday the index close at 2330. Foreign investors, who be be woo by India as a source of much-needed capital, will also be concern at the late allegations of poor management at the exchange. In one of its most damaging passages, the inspectors' report allege that D S Prabhoodas, a leading firm head by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's govern body, avoid margin payments total Rs185.4m (pounds 4.08m). Mr Kothari say yesterday that most of the transactions cover by the report be off-exchange deals directly between financial institutions for which margin payments be not required. Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive director, say BSE rules permit such bilateral off-exchange transactions. Sebi also accuse the exchange of mismanage the administration of its building. This week's argument be only the late in a series of disputes which begin almost as soon as Sebi start operations a year ago. It be establish by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, as a crucial element in financial reform. Brokers claim the Sebi be heavy-handed and fail to understand their needs. They say rules must be apply flexibly and many firms be extremely small and unable to carry the cost of extra regulations. But the finance minister be back Sebi to the hilt and single it out for praise in his recent budget speech. Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and others to dodge taxes and also contribute to last year's securities market scandal in which banks, include the UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lose a combine gross total of Rs40bn. The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, be rock by two powerful bombs last Friday, leave 60 dead and 200 injured. The market reopen on Monday in an attempt to return to normal. It have have to compromise - trading have be restrict to an hour a day, and dealing have move back to the traditional ring, where it stop a year ago. Dealers seem to like this, the BSE index rise by 5.6 per cent on Monday and Tuesday. But another bomb blast in Calcutta trigger nervous sell yesterday, and the index come back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,409.23. All this have take place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so, have have to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment. Dr Manmohan Singh, the indian finance minister, disappoint traders in the budget at the end of last month. He postpone corporate tax reforms by a year, deny hopes of a tax cut recommend by an expert group. He do reduce excise and import duties on a broad front, but leave out the cement and steel sectors, where share prices have be boost by pre-budget speculation. To top it all, Dr Singh refuse to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in tax short-term capital gains. He lower the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remain at 44.5 per cent. take the tax concessions for granted, traders have drive up share prices in February to make a kill later. Instead, the budget turn out to be a nightmare. While industry and business welcome the statement which, for once, do not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock market theorist and academic, say a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits ex-growth this year. The relative lack of financial concessions mean that disappointed traders sell with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seem bottomless as equity prices plummet to a 13-month low. Overseas investors fuel the downtrend as they sell some half a million shares of Reliance Industries, arbitrage between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (gdrs). The opportunity arise after a change in indian regulations which allow international investors to convert GDRs into the underlying stock. At the current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetch Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210. The BSE 30-share index plunge by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10, from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27. Share prices rebound last week, take the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance, have continue this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday. Whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the ability of bulls to maintain their momentum. They be hop that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after 'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by international investors. The indian stock markets have be pass through a series of crises since December, when activists of the Bhartiya Janta party pull down the Babri mosque at Ayodhya, spark off communal riots. Mr Mark Bulloch of Jardine Fleming take the domestic political situation in his stride. 'nothing dramatic have happen as far as foreign investors be concerned,' he says. 'They be appraise the political situation.' In the meantime, there be no compulsion for local investors to sell. In this, they be more fortunate than they be in previous years, when they be under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gains tax exemption before the financial year end in March. The exemption have be replace by a flat 20 per cent tax this year which, accord to dealers, puts bulls and bears on an even footing. THE INDIAN government fly federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bomb explode in the city, kill about 200 people and injure more than a thousand. The devices, mostly car bombs, appear to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart. All explode within 90 minutes in the afternoon. Among the targets be the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport. The identity of the bombers be unknown, but the attacks be a severe setback to India's attempts to heal the wounds create by recent intercommunal violence, which have cause deep shock throughout India. more than 2,000 people die in riots, include over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6. The bomb appear design to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. One of the targets be close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party accuse of foment violence during the riots, in which most victims be Moslems. National and local state leaders appeal for calm in an attempt to prevent a renew outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urge the nation to ignore rumours after the 'inhuman and criminal bomb blasts'. Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister of Maharashtra state, say all roads into Bombay have be block and the army put on alert. He said: 'It be aim at disrupt the economy and it appear a conscious effort because only Bombay seem to be the target.' Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, tell parliament in New Delhi: 'We suspect an international conspiracy.' The indian High Commission in London say the attacks be 'part of the externally support terrorism which have target India for some time'. However, Indian officials stop short of directly accuse Pakistan, the country's arch-enemy. The bomb attacks be spread throughout the city and be clearly aim at the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which victims be mainly poor. At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people be on the second-storey trading floor when a bomb explode in the underground car park, hurl shards of glass across the floor and into the street. Some victims be crush in the stampede to escape. Outside, burned bodies lay among litter from shatter buildings. MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar be serve lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he be shower with fly glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rock the city and leave at least 255 people kill and over 1,200 injured. 'I'm lucky to be alive,' he say from his hospital bed. 'Who do this? Who can stop this happen again?' Across Bombay people be ask themselves the same questions this weekend. They sense there be an enormous difference from the riots which scar the city in December and again in January. Those be cause by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stir by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya. The weapons use be mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles. Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money. The only comparable previous incident be the assassination in 1991 of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists. But that be a single bomb aim at one man - the explosions in Bombay be design to terrorise the nation's commercial capital. Bombay accounts for 35 per cent of India's exports. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, describe the blasts as an attack on India's economy. The immediate assumption both at the high level and in the streets of Bombay be that those responsible must have be foreigners or have foreign help. But these suggestions be see in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind be the real suspect - Moslem extremists who might have take revenge for the riots which hit India after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which leave 2,000 dead, include 700 in Bombay. If Moslems be find to have stag the attacks, the indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation be support from a Moslem country, notably Pakistan. The implications would be vast. Breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road. Mr Rao choose his words carefully during his visit to Bombay: 'There be a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country. I do not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and outside the country.' There be no evidence link the attacks to Moslem extremists, let alone to Pakistan. even if Moslem groups be find to be responsible for the bombings, they could have be supply from other Moslem countries. India would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale. For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where the atmosphere yesterday be calm. Workmen be clear away rubble at the blast sites, include the blacken stock exchange building. Bombayites seem determine to put the outrage behind them. At the Gymkhana Club and dozens of other sports grounds, hundreds of men and boys be play cricket as they do every sunday. Others be walk along the seafront by the arch of the Gateway of India. The stock exchange authorities plan to re-start trading as soon as they can -probably today - use an old trading floor the exchange vacate only last year. Businessmen estimate the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injuries and the damage cause to blast buildings. They do not expect the same widespread disruption to production as occurred during the riots. Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly call paramilitary and regular troops to help patrol sensitive districts. But much more should go to the people of Bombay, who, so far at least, have refuse to be goad into violent protest by the bombers.

2,d120i,"THE revelation that John Major be capable of candid, blunt and salty language when talk off-the- record to friendly journalists have surprise some people. It have even be suggest that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major use a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good. With luck, it be reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction. What piffle. Major be a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a conservative majority of 23,015 at last year's general election be convert into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Fifteen months too late, the voters of Christchurch round on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury. In reality, all politicians, not just Major, be far more candid and salty when chat in private than when speak in public. In public, they have to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness. But in private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really be a spectacle. To show you what I mean, I speak yesterday to John Major and John Smith. Smith, a Scot, be leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know that. In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lose its deposit, I want to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching. To guarantee them privacy, I use a signal-scrambler. No one could have eavesdropped. Their responses be true to form. But I have leave out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide state that 'the gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities be discourage . . . four-letter expletives will usually be confine to infrequent use in the review (Arts) pages.' I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation be a puzzle. First, I tackle Major. I said: 'Did you read, john, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week? They be describe Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements. They do not pull their punches. I bet you go chalk-white. 'So why not walk the plank, John? You be the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly or not, you be draw the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone the cock-ups.' 'are you sure?' the prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . how do it come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load of . . . let me put it to you - the economy, of course . . . I mean, wimpy guy like me. But I'm not give in like that, like . . .' On and on it went. then I ring John Smith. I tell him I have be impress with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which he sharpen up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever get elected), include a referendum on proportional representation. I said: 'You be start to raise your game, John. Many people will have agree with your assertion that democracy in Britain be decaying, and that the Tories must be roast for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation of power and the elimination of opposition'. But some of your critics still accuse you, John, of laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say to that?' 'Away, ye thowless jad,' shout the Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig be Rab M'Graen, a clever, sturdy fellow, but then he be sae fley'd by his showther gae a keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle. likewise with political and constitutional reform, Michael, for by the L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, as lang's I dow]' After that, I think of telephone Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his views on Christchurch. But I couldn't raise the energy. last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we be be old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claim that the Majors' favourite film be be There. I entirely concur with their choice. In case you do not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, be the plot: a man no one know anything about, a gardener call Chauncey, rise without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency. Chauncey, play by Peter Sellers, utter only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convince the Republican party's power brokers that he be a sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seem to hear what they want to believe. He have a deadly innocence. No wonder the Majors like this film. John Major must, at some level, have appreciate the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's. If he do not see the similarity, that be still more revealing. do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener. In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclose an unknown fact: his father be once a farmer. Farmers Weekly, you see, have ask Major how he have 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'. (well, it be obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father be a farmer. He live on a small farm somewhere in Shropshire.' Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past, immediately ring 10 Downing Street, which claim that Major's father farm near Bromsgrove in 1910. As Wheen point out, Major be an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove be not in Shropshire. This, of course, do not mean that Major make everything up. Family folklore be a peculiar thing. yet when I hear about this, my mind immediately go back to an incident a few months ago, when Major visit Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel industry, as part of his american tour. I recall that he make a great hit by recount that his father have be a steelworker in the city. A farmer for Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the american audience . . . a pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all things to all people. If John Major be a different sort of politician, this would be a point barely worth making. But it do seem all of a piece with Major's approach to wider political issues. On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by claim to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe. On the other he be free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it be necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics. There be those who will argue that this merely mean that Major be a typical democratic politician, that one who want to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest, not just one. But that have not be true of Major's most recent conservative predecessors. Margaret Thatcher be notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too be Edward Heath, even though he always pretend to be a 'consensus politician'. No, Major's technique be very much his own invention, very much a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his unsettled family background. His father, Tom Major-Ball, be an itinerant figure, move from place to place, try his hand at any number of occupations, include the circus. No wonder the young John Major learn the skill of fit in with prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating. The only problem be the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. Except in the movies. Dominic Lawson be editor of The Spectator ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprise everyone but himself by win the general election. His honeymoon, after a very personal victory, be short-lived and now he begin the second year of his hard-won term as a deeply unpopular leader who have everything still to prove. The past 12 months have be hijack by internal party differences over Europe, by the debacle surround UK withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep recession which have disappoint and alienate many traditional Tory supporters in business. Mr Major's anniversary inevitably lead yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretend that the last year have be easy,' he also claim that much have be achieved. The government's efforts to secure a framework for long-term prosperity be begin to pay off. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, be join by 10 frontbench colleagues in launch a counter-attack, involve a detailed and documented indictment of Mr Major's failures. He attack the Tories for build 'a bonfire of pre-election commitments'. Tory allegiances in the business world have also be put under immense pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as recession ends. yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, remain cautious but volunteered: 'If I be a bet man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery.' Mr Major can take little comfort from the conclusion, widespread among industrialists, that his great achievement in the past year have be Britain's withdrawal from the ERM - something which he resist and over which, in the end, he have no control. most industrialists, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major as an individual, with many draw a flatter parallel between his personal qualities and those of his predecessor. He still attract gratitude for the election victory, which be see - despite subsequent problems for the economy - as the best result for business. But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he be see as a weak leader, with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction. There be a general perception that, important though Britain's future place in Europe is, the prime minister have be excessively preoccupy with community affairs and associate internal party ructions, to the detriment of the domestic economy. many industrialists be pleased that Mr Major be now attempt to reshape economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base.

Major receive 185 votes, two short of a majority. Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine receive 131 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd have 56.

Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both join the race, but before the vote her aides spread the word that she be back Major. The son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare recipient, Major personify the values of self-reliance and hard work that Mrs. Thatcher have preach to the nation. His election climax a month of british politics-turned-upside down, and the western world's longest-serving head of government be drive from office by a revolt in party ranks. head a government that be trail the opposition Labor Party in the polls and suffer a losing streak in local Parliamentary elections, Mrs. Thatcher lose control of events after her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resign on Nov. 1. Howe, the fourth Cabinet member to resign because of disputes over policy toward the European Community, shock the House of Commons on Nov. 13 by call Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital interests. The next day, Heseltine announce he would challenge her. Six days later, with Mrs. Thatcher at a 34-nation summit in Paris officially end the Cold War, Heseltine poll enough votes to deny her re-election as leader. Two days later, she decide to resign after party leaders tell her she could not win. Heseltine, 57, say Major's election lay the basis for the unity of our party. Hurd say the party need to unite, and John Major be the right leader for this task. opposition leaders deride Major's election as Thatcherism with a different face. The Conservatives' main rivals, the socialist Labor Party, demand a general election. John Major be a Thatcherette - that be how he seek election and that be how he get elected, say Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. It mean that the policies that bring the poll tax, recession, heavy mortgages and rise unemployment will go on. During his five-day campaign, Major have aaid he would review the poll tax, an unpopular local tax bring in by Mrs. Thatcher, but he give no other hints of differ with her. While adopt a gentler tone on the contentious issue of Britain's involvement in Europe, he shares her opposition to a single european currency and shares her belief in tight restraint on government spending. However, he insist over the weekend, I be not run as `son of Thatcher.' I be run as myself, with my own priorities and my own programs. Major's victory end a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party. Tomorrow always dawns, he said, smile after concede defeat. Major be elect to Parliament in 1979, be appoint foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year. He move up quickly in the leadership race. By the weekend, opinion polls show that Major be nearly as highly regard by the public as be Heseltine, who have be prominent for a decade. Major attract support from figures on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friends insist Major's own views be more liberal than many supposed. He describe himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social issues.

In May local elections across Britain, however, the Conservatives loss 444 seats, and word circulated that Major was not up to the job.Major became leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister after his mentor, Margaret Thatcher resigned under pressure in 1990. Though he won the 1992 general election, the lingering recession and controversies involving European community issues splintered the Tories. He came to be viewed as a weak, vacillating leader, lacking political conviction.","In early May elections across Britain, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing 444 seats. One editorial claims some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major, and there is speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher when she resigned under pressure in November 1990. After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift. Major's comment while visiting America a month later that Iraqi troops might have to be ""forcibly removed"" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard-line on the Persian Gulf.Within a year of winning the general election, his popularity had plunged. In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015 the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Though Major's personal style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak leader, lacking vision and political conviction.

3,d117i,"japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro win the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel The Remains of the Day, judges announce Thursday. The prize be worth $32,000. Judges praise the novel, a love story about a butler's english vacation, as a cunningly structure and beautifully pace performance. other finalists this year be canadian Margaret Atwood for Cat's Eye, Irish author John Banville for Book of Evidence, Scotland's James Kelman for A Disaffection and English writers Sybille Bedford for Jigsaw and Rose Tremain for Restoration. After receive the prize, Ishiguro pay tribute to Salman Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who go into hiding in February when he be threaten with death by Moslems who say his novel The Satanic Verses blaspheme their faith. now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it be inconvenient for many people to support his writing, I just felt it be fit that we should not turn our backs on him, Ishiguro said. Rushdie live in England. Ishiguro, 39, arrive in England at age 6 and now live in south London. He write in English. In announce the winner, the judges said: `the Remains of the Day' renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and explore the large, vex themes of class, tradition and duty. It be narrowly preferred but universally admired. Ishiguro be a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his novel An artist of the Floating World. The Booker Prize be sponsor by Booker, an international food and agriculture business. After hours of heat delib-eration - under a system describe as 'mad' by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night go to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, publish by Secker and Warburg. The novel, a story of scottish low-life narrate largely in glaswegian dialect, be unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damn all six books shortlist for the prize as boring, elitist and - bad of all - unsaleable. Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledge that Mr Kelman's book in particular might be deem inaccessible. 'We have an extremely difficult final meeting and be very divided,' he say after three hours of debate. Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, say she be make extremely cross by the decision. 'it's just a drunken Scotsman rail against bureaucracy,' she said. 'my eyes be stretch in disbelief. The voting system be completely mad. Kelman be the least favourite of the three front runners. If it have be a short story it would have be fine.' Mr Kelman's book is, accord to some observers, the most difficult work to have win the prize. In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceive by some as a scottish isolationist, anticipate the criticism, by declaring: 'my culture and my language have the right to exist.' One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who win the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman be good, but not as good as he think he is.' The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoke controversy. But this year's row have be of a particularly fine vintage. Prof Bayley go on record with a rouse condemnation of contemporary fiction. Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, be attack for fail to reveal that a young novelist be consider for the award, Ms Claire Messud, be in fact Mrs James Wood. Most damaging of all be the verdict of the booksellers, who dismiss the shortlist as narcoleptic. The other contenders be The Folding Star by Alan Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill Paton Walsh. In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominate have be sell 50 per cent less than last year's shortlist. last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sell 350,000 copies. 'Kelman's novel be unlikely to come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said. Mr Kelman be also shortlist for the prize in 1989 for his novel A Disaffection. It be a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania, and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk print it. Out be the eminences gris of victorian letters - novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advise Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make the grade. This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announce by six judges, include biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. They have avoid dull and worthy classics and choose six books which stir the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide. The winner will be reveal on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature. Like today's Booker Prize, it be a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which be back the spoof award, be a significant publisher of classic victorian novels. But the retrospective Booker be also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction. It raise questions about how the relationship between literature and society have change in the past 100 years. First, the similarities. A good yarn be a good yarn. Of the 1894 books, Trilby be the tale of a tone-deaf model who sing like an angel when mesmerise by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croak like a crow when he die during one of her concerts. The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an Englishman impersonate the King of Ruritania and rescue him from demons. On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef be about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend. All the books on both lists be grip stories. The lists share key themes. Both, for instance, have books about colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which be set in the First World War in German East Africa. Both provoke in similar ways. The controversial books of 1894 be Trilby, with its louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl be seduced, impregnated and offer the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver. It be now see as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it have problems find a publisher and the powerful circulate libraries refuse to take it. A century on, the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remain vexed. last week, a Times critic complain about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the Booker list, because it offend judaeo-christian ethics. But even if Hollinghurst win the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which become the bestselling novel of the 19th century. For the great difference between then and now be that in 1894 a Booker Prize be not need to sell fiction. Today, we accept the gap between literary writing, such as Hollinghurst's, and popular bestsellers by writers like Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland. This be the gap the Booker try to bridge by give high-level publicity to works which would not normally reach a mass audience. The trick work - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sell 360,000 hardback copies. Before the short-list be announce it sell 10,600. The Victorians, in contrast, be lovers of contemporary fiction. Novels account for 20 per cent of publish books, and no distinction be make between high and low art. In the mid 19th century, Dickens make Pounds 12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today. Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK be half that of today and the literate population small still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sell 400,000 copies. All the 1894 Booker writers be popular names; they be also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later. Why be fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894? Social, cultural and psychological reasons play a part. Socially, the 1890s read public be a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle class authors write for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate be to belong to an elite. The idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction be irrelevant. Culturally, these writers and readers be certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel be their political and intellectual forum. Today we no longer share the victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age. Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by Joyce and Woolf weaken 20th-century belief in the novel and encourage the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow. The dominance of film and television have make novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents. George du Maurier originally offer the outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he think would write a good novel. Today du Maurier would have sell it to Hollywood or the BBC. The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if we know them, be answer in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th century we have tv soaps. Just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop be run as a serial there be widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would die, and readers write in beg for her to be saved. Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterise today's soaps be clear features of the novel in 1894. Both In the year of Jubilee and Esther Waters, for example, centre on the burn 1890s debate about marriage, feminism and the 'New Woman', yet both be also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed. The 1894 books be compel because they prefigure our own times and yet be set back from them. Trilby be a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide pave the way for Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression. It be unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today. Whereas the 1894 titles have contemporary settings, many of the 1994 books be historical (such as Paradise) or be drive by nostalgia (such as Beside the Ocean of Time). Which book will win on October 15? Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he die in 1894 in Samoa, the setting of The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote, because it be the best-known today and have fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young man's self-discovery. My vote go to trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - in its anti-semitic portrait of Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it be a story of demonic possession and haunt the imagination like a fairy tale long after better-written works have fade from memory. Like Rebecca, the popular novel by du Maurier's granddaughter, it be a natural equivalent of what the current Booker Prize seek to create: a combination of the classic and the bestseller. The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announce yesterday, immediately prompt the question 'Who?' from many in the publishing industry. accord to one insider, some on the list 'are b-team writers at best'. The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which be tip as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which be almost universally well-reviewed. As for the other three - knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (hamish Hamilton) by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John Murray) by 72-year-old orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make the grade'. The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hype literary prize and one of the most lucrative, be all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfil the criteria - english language and non-american - for consideration for the award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seem an astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace. But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surround the award be as rife as ever. One unsurprising omission from the final selection be When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which be on the 'long list' before it be point out that the author be the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge. Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, express surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud. But it be the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredit the award accord to some critics. 'This list,' say one man of letters, 'must have deal a final death blow to the Booker.' The winner, select from an original 130, will be announce on October 11. The Booker Prize be Britain's literary event of the year, guarantee to boost sales of the chosen novel after the award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in London's ancient Guildhall. The prize to the author be a check for 20,000 pounds (nearly $38,000), sponsor by Booker, an international food and agriculture business. british publishers be very secretive about their sales but we know that when Thomas Keneally win it in 1982 for `schindler's Ark,' his publishers, who have print 15,000 copies, sell 75,000 over the next 23 weeks, say Christine Shaw of Book Trust. The trust be a charity promote reading and books and administer the prize. The prize have become internationally known, and the worldwide demand for the win book, in English and translations, be spectacular, say Shaw. The prize be first award in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing. british publishers can submit three new novels by british and Commonwealth writers. There be 110 submissions last year. A management committee of authors, booksellers, librarians and the sponsors choose a jury of five: a writer or two, an academic, a politician interested in literature and a literary editor or critic. Each juror read every book submitted, lists about six favorites and meets the other jurors to select and announce six finalists. As public debate rages over who's in, who's out and who might win, with bookmakers across the country call the odds, the jurors meet again and finally select the winner on the afternoon of announcement day. This year's finalists: Beryl Bainbridge An Awfully Big Adventure, A.S. Byatt Possession, Penelope Fitzgerald The Gate of Angels, John McGahern Amongst Women, Brian Moore Lies of Silence and Mordecai Richler Solomon Gursky Was Here. Six novels have be nominate for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say the favorite be The Remains of the Day by japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro. The award, to be announce Oct. 26, carry a $31,600 prize fund by the Booker McConnell food company. Oddsmaker William Hill give 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about a butler's travel through Britain's West Country and say it be a firm favorite to win. Ishiguro, previously nominate for the award, be beat as the Booker favorite in 1986, which make his chances that much strong this time in our view, say William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe. The other books nominate are: Cat's Eye, a story of painter Elaine Risley and her return to her childhood home in Toronto by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, also a previous nominee. The Book of Evidence, a prison story of kidnap and murder convict Freddie Montgomery by John Banville, literary editor of The Irish Times newspaper. Jigsaw, by Sybille Bedford, an autobiographical novel about an adolescent's travels through Germany, Italy and France. A Disaffection, Scottish novelist James Kelman's story about a school teacher, Patrick Doyle, whose professional frustrations be fuel by a drinking problem and unrequited love for a colleague. Restoration, British author Rose Tremain's story of Robert Merivel, a favorite of King Charles II who marry the monarch's young mistress. We expect more interest in this year's Booker Prize than ever before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over Salman Rushdie's `Satanic Verses,' Sharpe said. Rushdie be nominate for the prize last year but it be win by australian author Peter Carey for his love story Oscar and Lucinda. Rushdie, a british citizen, have be in hide since Feb. 14 when the late iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini order he be kill for allegedly blaspheme Islam in Satanic Verses. This year's six nominees be choose Thursday from 102 books consider by a panel head by David Lodge, a british literary critic and novelist who be nominate for the prize last year for his book, Nice Work. On the day of the Big Event, Ladbroke, the large british betting agency, post the final odds. Brian Moore be the favorite at 7-4, follow by Peter Ackroyd (5-2), Iris Murdoch (3-1) and Chinua Achebe (9-2). The two dark horses, Nina Bawden and Penelope Lively, be each tip at 7-1.you may have notice a distinctly literary tilt to that lineup, an affinity with the bookshelf, not the bookie. All of those people publish new works of fiction here in Britain during the past 12 months. And for the last few weeks, literary punters throughout the british Isles have be place bets on which of those writers would win the Booker Prize, the best-known, best-liked and, almost incidentally, most prestigious fiction award in the land.in recent weeks the Booker contenders have receive almost as much press coverage as the Charles and Di rift. And nearly every article, from book reviews to author interviews, have feature the late odds. The betting be do largely by literary insiders, say Graham Sharpe, who set the Booker odds at William Hill, Britain's other big betting agency. ""They read the books, hear the gossip and want to pull off a little coup for themselves,"" he says.last year's winner, ""The Old Devils"" by Kingsley Amis, be a 5-2 favorite, but this year, anyone who choose the victor make some dough.""when she accept her prize for ""moon Tiger,"" Penelope Lively look surprised and pleased. ""I'm not a betting woman, and I have slight reservations about books become a spectator sport,"" she say in soft Oxbridge tones. ""But those who be in the know tell me that 7-1 be an irresistible flutter."" Her 65-year-old mother be among those who make a killing.america have the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) Booker Prize. With the possible exception of France's respect Prix Goncourt, there's nothing quite like it anywhere else.Britons wryly compare the Booker to the Academy Awards, and though there's just one prize and no envelope, similarities exist. There's a team of judges and a pool of candidates. This year each british publisher could submit three new titles, for a grand total of 93. As one judge note wearily, ""By August, I be in more than a slight panic, sometimes read all day and evening; read while stand at the bus stop, read while cooking, reading, almost, while talk on the telephone.""next come the ""short-list,"" the judges' top six, which be announce with great fanfare in late september. This year the works include Brian Moore's political thriller ""The Color of Blood"" (E.P. Dutton, 182 pages, $16.95); Peter Ackroyd's ""Chatterton"" (Grove Press, 240 pages, $17.95); Nina Bawden's ""Circles of Deceit"" (St. Martin's Press, 208 pages, $14.95); Iris Murdoch's 23rd novel ""The Book and the Brotherhood"" (Viking, 608 pages, $19.95); nigerian writer Chinua Achebe's ""Anthills of the Savannah"" (Doubleday, 240 pages, $16.95); and ""moon Tiger"" (Grove Press, 216 pages, $15.95).the awards presentation come on the last Thursday in October, and like any major awards presentation, it come complete with limousines, banquet (salmon mousse, champagne sorbet and English roast beef) and television cameras. The suspense be genuine; the judges choose the winner just three hours before the announcement.to be sure, the ratings for the prime-time broadcast didn't upstage those of ""eastenders,"" Britain's popular soap opera. yet interest be sufficient for Andre Deutsch, ""Moon Tiger's"" British publisher, to order up an additional 20,000 copies almost the minute Mrs. Lively -- and the nation -- hear the news.by british standards, sales figures for recent Booker winners be stunning, from ""The Old Devils"" (80,000 hard-cover copies) to Anita Brookner's ""Hotel du Lac"" (40,000 copies). even Keri Hulme's ""The Bone People,"" a look at Maori culture that most readers find impenetrable, reach a respectable 21,000 in 1985.short-listed authors be just a few paces behind, share the best-seller list with Dick Francis and Scott Turow. Heinemann initially print 3,000 copies of ""Anthills of the Savannah,"" the usual run for contemporary literary fiction. So far, 10,000 copies have sold. ""being short-listed probably change the destiny of that book,"" declare a member of the Heinemann sales staff. Indeed, there's currently talk of initiate a similar prize with a similar purse for the year's best biography.another notable spinoff be the Booker harpies, readers intent on digest all six titles, then vigorously dispute the choices, which never please everyone. This year the Sunday Times offer readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of $112, perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot.it wasn't always this way, of course. Headlines be modest back in 1969 when P.H. Newby win the first ever Booker Prize for ""something to Answer For."" (The wonderfully appropriate name come from Booker-McConnell PLC, the international food and agriculture conglomerate that put up the prize money each year.)the idea be to devise a british equivalent to the Prix Goncourt, and like that august french award, the Booker attract attention the minute it kick up controversy. The early fuss be keep within the literary world, with critics snip over choices and the prize's vary ground rules. The real world take notice in 1974, when Elizabeth Jane Howard, one of the three judges, write a letter to the Times claim that in her opinion Kingsley Amis's ""ending Up,"" one of the short-listed books, be his best ever. As it happens, she be marry to Mr. Amis at the time. He didn't win.but many credit the Booker's current appeal to the 1982 competition and Thomas Keneally's ""Schindler's Ark,"" or ""Schindler's List"" as it be know in the U.S. Written as a novel, the book tell the true story of a remarkable german who save the lives of hundreds of Jews in concentration camps. But even after it win the Booker, people argue that it wasn't a novel. ""the more people question it, the more it sold,"" say Ion Trewin, editorial director at Hodder & Stoughton. ""That be the first year the prize catch the media and public imagination. suddenly the Booker gain inches on front pages.""oh yes, ""moon Tigers"" be a die woman's recollection of her life as a World War II war correspondent and her affair with a young tank officer.--- Ms. Trucco be a free-lance writer base in London. Australian novelist Peter Carey be award the coveted Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday night for his love story, Oscar and Lucinda. A panel of five judges unanimously announce the award of the $26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at London's ancient Guildhall. The judges make their selection from 102 books publish in Britain in the past 12 months and which they read in their homes. Carey, who live in Sydney with his wife and son, say in a brief speech that like the other five finalists he have be ask to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won. If I'd know I be go to win I think I would have take a bit more trouble with my handwriting, he say as he star down at his notes. He be unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his novel, Illywhacker, be among the final six. Carey call the award a great honor and he thank the prize sponsors for provoke so much passionate discussion about literature perhaps there will be more tomorrow. everyone who love good books benefits from this, surely, he added. The win novel be a fitting choice for Australia's bicentennial year. It tell of a romance between an English gambler and an australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to Australia in the mid-19th century. The story weave in australian history from its founding in 1788 by british immigrants. Panel chairman Michael Foot, a writer and former leader of the opposition Labor Party, say the judges agree that entries this year have be exceptionally strong and that choose the last six novels be extremely difficult. We hope there will be no criticisms but if there are, then people should start read the books for themselves, Foot said. Carey be the only non-briton in the final six.

A joint statement after the meeting say despite their ideological and political differences, (the parties) be one in defend the unity and integrity of the country, the news agency reported. Jagmohan say the truck be drive around Srinagar distribute food to troop on street corners when it be blow up by Moslem militants. He give no further details of the attack. The attacks come amid government claims that security forces arrest at least 12 leaders of the Moslem group Hezbul Mujahedeen. Jagmohan say the militants, from Srinagar and the border towns of Baramulla and Kupwara, have be arrest since Sunday. Hezbul Mujahedeen be one of 30 militant groups fight for secession. It be believe the second most powerful independence group after the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. We be go to hit hard at anti-national elements, there be no way they can get away with what they be doing, Jagmohan said. It may take a month, six months, maybe a year, but ultimately these anti-national elments be go to be neutralized. Jagmohan, a Hindu, be appoint the state governor of Jammu-Kashmir on Jan. 18 in an attempt by the government to control the unrest. Kashmir have be a problem for more than four decades follow the 1947 partition of british colonial India into predominantly Moslem Pakistan and the mostly Hindu India. Jammu-Kashmir, then a princely state, chose to merge with India. Pakistan protested, claim the territory because of its predominantly Moslem population. The two countries have twice go to war over the territory. The Kashmir portion of Jammu-Kashmir be mostly Moslem, while the southern Jammu segment be predominantly Hindu. Overall, about 65 percent of the state's 6 million people be Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people and Hindus account for 82 percent. Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of houseboat hotels and Mogul gardens from whose name the English make cashmere, have become a war zone of separatism and religious enmity. Military jeep carry senior government officials and civil servants around Srinagar in these dangerous days, as soldiers and paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem separatists in the Kashmir Valley. Intelligence officer M.K. Kaul command one of the jeeps. At the beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turn to the four soldiers in the jeep's rear seats and ordered: Check your weapons. Be ready to fire.

At least 72 people have be kill since the crackdown begin Jan. 20 in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and buildings. most of the dead have be Moslem militants shoot by indian troops. We be neither fight a war nor try to suppress any popular movement, say Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority. We be fight a handful of terrorists who be determine to create a law and order problem, say Jagmohan, a Hindu with a reputation for toughness. other officials in Kashmir say privately the situation be critical, perhaps the most serious threat India have face in 42 years of independence from Britain. It look like everyone here have turn into a fundamentalist with firm belief that the day be not far off when they will become independent, a state police officer said. Kashmir be a separate kingdom, rule by a Hindu maharajah, when Britain relinquish colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1947, and the subcontinent be partition on religious lines into India and Pakistan. The Hindu king opt to join India, not Pakistan, and the dispute over Kashmir have exacerbate relations since. Pakistan take the western part of Kashmir and India the eastern. Each accuse the other of forcible occupation. They have fight wars over Kashmir and the border question remain unresolved. U.N. observers be station on the truce line and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire. Officials will not say how many reinforcements have be send to the Kashmir Valley since Jan. 20, but reports from various sources indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have be deployed. It be the valley's heavily Moslem population that tilt the sectarian scale in Jammu-Kashmir state. Of the state's nearly 6 million people, 64 percent be Moslems and 32 percent Hindus. Most Hindus live in the southern Jammu area. Srinagar have 150 mosques. This be the best breeding ground for Moslem fundamentalism, say a federal official who help coordinate the new security measures. nearly every mosque have a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to prayer and, more recently, to exhort listeners to defend their faith and Kashmir. The residents be constantly bombard with Islamic sermons and be remind that fight a `jihad' (islamic holy war) be the most sacred duty of every Moslem, the federal official said, on condition of anonymity. Electricity be cut off in the city Friday, which be both the Moslem sabbath and India's national Republic Day on India's Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeakers continue operating because militants connect them to car batteries. Intelligence reports suggest the government have an advantage because the separatists be not united. The most powerful group be the jammu-kashmir Liberation Front, but there be several others, include the Allah Tigers, Hezb-e-Mujahed Hezb-e-Islami. India claim the fundamentalists get money and weapons from Pakistan. The Pakistanis deny it. Jagmohan, the governor, insist the main issue in Kashmir be economic development, not separatism. The people do not want violence or the so-called independent Kashmir, he said. The need of the hour be development. Let more tourists come. let new schools be built. Let new hospitals come up. As he spoke, military officers wait in the next room to discuss a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist brochures call Paradise. Right now, Paradise look lost, at least temporarily.

He also say indian soldiers fire on an ambulance and a bus. There be no report from India on the allege firing. Despite the tension, officials from both sides say the incidents do not appear to be serious. There be no cause for any undue concern since we trust that these localized incidents will be contain and the situation defused, United News of India quote Singh as say in the Parliament. Singh say directors of military operations from both countries be in touch. He do not elaborate. The Pakistani official said: This be not a serious situation. It's just in one sector. It could be just a local incident. We don't know what it will lead to. We'll just have to wait and see. India and Pakistan have go to war twice over Kashmir, in 1965 and 1971. Both sides claim Kashmir, which have be divide into indian and Pakistani sectors. Tensions over Kashmir flare again this summer.

On Feb. 5, at least one person be kill and 12 wound when Pakistani mobs try to cross the cease-fire line near Jammu, 95 miles to the south. The two demonstrations at the cease-fire line be to express support for Moslem militants who be fight for independence for the moslem-dominated state from the predominantly Hindu India.

At least 85 people have be kill since the crackdown began. most of the victims have be curfew-breaking protesters shoot by security forces in Srinagar. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, have be the center of the secessionist movement that have turn violent in recent years.

India say Pakistan trains and arms the militants in Kashmir, at the far northern tip of India. Pakistan deny it. India and Pakistan have fight two wars over the region since 1947, when both nations win independence from Britain. Pakistani and indian troops exchange fire for several hours today after a Pakistani soldier become the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border, officers and a western observer said. The soldier be shoot in the leg Sunday at a ceasefire line, several miles from the village of Chaukothi, officials say on condition of anonymity. They say there be no reports of casualties from today's firefight at the line, which divide Kashmir between Pakistan and India. The nations have twice go to war over the Himalayan state, in 1948 and again in 1965. The former princely state be divide between the two nations after british colonial rule end in 1947. Relations between the neighbors have become increasingly strained since Jan. 20 when indian troops launch a military crackdown on Moslem separatists in turbulent Jammu-Kashmir. The militants want India's only majority Moslem state to either become independent or join Pakistan. Jammu-Kashmir be an aberration in India, where 82 percent of the country's 880 million people be Hindus. The leaders of both countries have try to soothe tempers in the dispute and have say another war over the region be unlikely. However, Pakistani forces have now seal off the border area at Chaukothi, forbid civilians from enter the area. The border crossing be the scene of a bloody confrontation on Feb. 11 between indian troops and Pakistani students, who be march in solidarity with activists in Indian-held Kashmir. Indian troops kill three students and wound several during that confrontation, a Pakistan defence ministry spokesman said. The two armies also exchange gunfire for about 30 minutes before calm be restored. A Paksitan army captain, who say he witness the firefight, say unlike the occasional shootings in the past, indian soldiers appear to be aim at Pakistani troops. The western observer say Sunday's shooting of the Pakistan soldier appear to back up that assertion. In another sign of increased tensions, Pakistani and indian officers be no longer accompany United Nations' military observers as they pass through the borders. It be not a normal situation, the officer said. The border be extremely tense. Pakistan officials say they be take steps to quell what one official call war fever on the Pakistan side. We be try to tie the people down, say Amir Alan Khan, a retired lieutenant colonel who head Kashmir's civil defence. He say hundreds of retired soldiers have approach him to ask for orders to fight the indian army. The bodies of four Moslems be find in a Kashmir town Monday, five days after they be kidnap by Moslem militants agitate for secession from India. The bodies, which have bullet wounds, be find in the town of Sopore about 35 miles northwest of the Kashmir capital of Srinagar, say police officials speak on condition of anonymity. anonymous callers to local newspapers and news agency offices say the four be kill by the Hezbul Mujahedeen because they be police informers. The Hezbul Mujahedeen be one of more than a dozen Moslem organizations fight for independence of the Kashmir valley from India. Police officials also report the death of one soldier in a militant ambush of an army convoy in the district of Baramulla, northwest of Srinagar. At least three soldiers be injured, they said. The deaths raise to 630 the number of people kill since security forces begin a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20. The Kashmir valley, most of which fall in the indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, be predominantly Moslem. Jammu-Kashmir be the only indian state with a Moslem majority. Moslem militants earlier have demand union with Pakistan, the Islamic nation on India's western border. But, of late, they have be demand independence and the status of a neutral nation. A leader of the Moslem separatist movement in Kashmir try to hurl a grenade into a police bunker Friday but be kill in a volley of police gunfire. Tens of thousands of Moslems gather later for the funeral. Comrades fire into the air and vow to carry on the fight for independence from India. Ashfaq Majid Wani, 28, be a leader of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, a leading separatist group. He be the front's area commander in Srinagar. Police say he try to throw the grenade at a police bunker in downtown Srinagar while rid by on a motor scooter. The grenade go off after officers open fire with automatic weapons. Three other people die in the melee, the police said. Hours later, thousands of residents gather near Wani's house in an attempt to hold a funeral procession in defiance of a government curfew. But soldiers and police prevent the procession and take Wani's body to a burial ground in a government ambulance escort by a police jeep. Women wail and beat their chest as Wani's body be take out of the ambulance and place near the grave. Men shouted: Ashfaq's blood will usher independence! A group militants fire pistols and automatic rifles in the air. Witnesses estimate the crowd at 40,000. The firing continue intermittently for more than one hour until the body wa inter at 5 p.m. We will carry forward Asfaq's mission, which be to gain independence, say one militant leader hold a soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifle. He refuse to give his name.

5,d112h,"DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin be intimately involve in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have be obtain by the Financial Times. Meanwhile, a director of a secretive swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, have break his silence and have admit that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which be at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, be make on the instructions of Robert Maxwell. This be the first time that Mr Rechsteiner have give details of the relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the Maxwell family. The FT have also obtain a letter and have see a corroborating fax which show that Mr Kevin Maxwell be intimately involve in the purchase of 9m shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex, another swiss Trust. The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex be the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price. The SFO be also investigate whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breach the Companies Act by fail to disclose the purchases of the shares by the swiss trusts. If either have a financial interest in the swiss trusts, the purchases should have be disclose under company law, because they be both directors of MCC. The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company control by the Maxwell family, provide Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, act as broker to the deals. Goldman's lawyers be convince that it act properly. Mr Rechsteiner yesterday break the silence he have maintain since Robert Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family. He say MCC share purchases have be 'going on for some time' through Yakosa. He deny that the shares be buy for Yakosa's 'own account'. He say the shares be buy for other 'foundations' and then 'held for a certain time.' He also stress that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rest with Robert Maxwell once they have be receive by Yakosa: 'Yakosa be own by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said. Mr Rechsteiner refuse to say who control the Maxwell Foundation, which be base in Liechtenstein, but say it be neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell. The FT have however obtain documents show that Mr Kevin Maxwell be closely involve in the process of pay for 25m MCC shares on behalf of two swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex. On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell send a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, tell him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be buy by the swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provide by BIT, a Maxwell private company. The fax, sign by Mr Maxwell, say that the funds would be remit to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury'. Two other faxes send by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same day show that the former be equally involve in the other end of the transaction, the sale of the 25m shares. The swiss trusts buy the shares, use Goldman as broker, from two Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme) and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme). Each pension fund sell 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or pound 27.47m in total. At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell send the two other faxes to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds. As a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he tell Mr Wood to pay each pension fund what it be owe to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr Maxwell describe as 'nominee' for the two pension funds. In other words, he tell Mr Wood that the shares be be buy for the swiss trusts with funds provide by BIT and that these funds should then be send by Goldman back to BIT. In the event, on May 31, Goldman receive the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer in its account at Barclays. Goldman then levy its commission and expenses on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wire the remainder back to BIT's NatWest account. Scots bank bows out, Page 8 Claims to Israeli shares, Page 8 Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the curtain rise on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicle the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell. Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompt Sir Nicholas to apply to the High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production. The musical tell the tycoon's life story through updated versions of familiar tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan. now in rehearsal, the show be due to open at London's Criterion theatre on February 11. The attorney-general's move to close down a west end production before its first night be regard as without precedent. However, it be no more unprecedented, most lawyers say, than the prospect of the Maxwell brothers have to commute to their trial at the Old Bailey past a theatre advertise the story of their father as 'the musical review that will make you laugh, sing - and be angry'. The musical, which have cost Pounds 1.1m to put on, have be produce by Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private companies. Mr Steadman indicate yesterday he intend the show to go on and that the attorney-general's application for an injunction would be contested. However, he say he be leave matters in the hands of his lawyers. Press coverage of the late publisher since his death have already cause deep concern to the Maxwell brothers' lawyers . Mr Alun Jones QC, Kevin Maxwell's barrister, lead calls for report restrictions to be place on a recent high Court ruling that Robert Maxwell have be fraudulent in his dealings with shares in Berlitz, the publishing company. turn down his request, the judge ask him: 'Is it go to be your client's defence that Mr Robert Maxwell be not guilty of misappropriation?' At that point, lawyers in court themselves fell about laughing. MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, be name as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year, accord to the chairman's statement release with MGN accounts yesterday. Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, two sons of the late Robert Maxwell, be name as the other two people most involve in these transactions. Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refuse to provide MGN with information, the statement says. Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, list a series of transactions - some of which he stress may have be perfectly legitimate - that take place in the past few months. He say legal action may be take against a number of organisations, include Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, over more than Pounds 40m in transfers from MGN if the bank be aware that they be 'effected for improper purposes'. Notes to the accounts show that MGN make extraordinary provisions of Pounds 421.5m in the year to December 29 1991, include Pounds 208.6m in pension deficiencies and Pounds 122.4m in transactions with maxwell-controlled companies. Sir Robert say that during the year there be at least 28 'unusual' payments for more than Pounds 1m from the group's bank accounts, make a total of more than Pounds 180m. 'some may well ultimately be establish to have arise under legitimate transactions.' Nine of the payments be authorise solely by Robert Maxwell. The others be authorise mainly by Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Michael Stoney, he says. One transfer to Goldman Sachs be countersign by Mr Ernest Burrington, former manage director, at the request of Mr Kevin Maxwell on the report instruction of Robert Maxwell. Two authorisations be countersign by Mr Lawrence Guest, former MGN finance director. Sir Robert say the MGN directors do not believe that either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest know there be anything improper about these payments. With these exceptions, 'the independent directors . . . be not involve in, and do not authorise or approve any of these payments,' he says. Sir Robert say the group finance department accept assurances from the treasury department - which be head by Mr Stoney - about 'the nature of certain transactions' include payments to financial institutions which be record as deposits. 'The treasury department arrange for it to appear that sums of interest have be credit to the group in respect of those 'deposits',' he says. In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accept by the MGN board: Internal controls and operating procedures which fail to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval; Bank mandates authorise by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permit the movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who be also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have review systems and mandates, but be not convened; The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activities. The report details a Pounds 50m loan make by Bankers Trust in London last October which appear to have be use to pay off a loan from Bankers Trust in New York to Robert Maxwell Group, parent of the Maxwell private interests, Separately, the statement highlights three transfers of more than Pounds 40m from MGN to Goldman Sachs - pound 11m of this be transfer on Robert Maxwell's signature to pay for previous dealings in Maxwell Communication Corporation stock. The balance be for foreign exchange trade exposures incur by Bishopsgate Investment Trust and Robert Maxwell Group, it says. He say MGN be inquire to see whether it can establish if Goldman Sachs be 'aware or should have be aware' that the transfers 'had be effect for improper purposes'. If so, he say 'it will be possible to seek orders against them . . . for the sums paid.' He say MGN be consider legal action against professional advisers in relation to property leases, and hop to recover money through claims on insurance policies write on Robert Maxwell's life. ABOUT 20 banks become con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses run by Robert Maxwell several months before he die and his business empire collapsed. Their concern arise when Maxwell Communication Corporation make late payments to them, a Financial Times investigation have discovered. Yet although some banks become alarmed at the implications for the financial health of his empire, they do not discuss their concerns with each other or with authorities such as the Bank of England. Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's former finance director, have describe his shock to the FT at discover last August that MCC have fail to settle foreign currency transactions with about 20 banks on time. start about July 4 1991, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Maxwell and his son, Kevin, have begin to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign currencies. In these 'spot' transactions, MCC would buy a currency in one financial centre promising to make payment in another centre. On a number of occasions, MCC receive the currency, but do not make the payment - thereby give itself an unauthorised loan. Mr Brookes say about 20 banks, include Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, be involve in the flurry of foreign exchange deals. At least Dollars 100m (pounds 55m) in unapproved credit be think to have be raise this way. A former Maxwell employee say some appear to have be channel into private Maxwell businesses. One banker say attempts to raise money by make late payments in the foreign market be a relatively well-known ruse with the nickname call 'teaming and lading'. It also emerge yesterday that National Westminster Bank, the big lender to the Maxwell private companies, felt badly let down by Maxwell because he fail to deliver funds on time at the end of July. At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on July 10, NatWest refuse Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m. NatWest be upset three weeks later when it provide funds - less than Pounds 100m - to the Maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repay the same day, and then find that repayment be not made. NatWest be force to convert this 'intra-day' transaction into a short-term loan, which be eventually repaid. The bank tell both Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell that it be concern that repayment have not be made, but it do not discuss the problem with other banks or with the Bank of England. Instead, it press on with its policy of reduce the size of its loans to the Maxwell businesses. NatWest's loans to the Maxwell empire now total Pounds 182m, half the level of two years ago. later last year, Robert Maxwell make many repayments to banks by loot pension fund assets and also carry out unusual fundraising exercises with US investment banks, from which tens of millions of dollars be borrow at a high price.

THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell like to think of himself as a 'strong ' chess player and there be always a chess set in his suite in his London headquarters. 'There be no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually be a strong player or that he play in any tournaments,' say Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday take over the business and assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge. There may be doubts about Robert Maxwell's strength as a player but less about his enthusiasm for the game. In 1990, through The European newspaper, he sponsor a section of the World Chess championships in New York. And when Pergamon be sell to Elsevier last year Maxwell keep the chess and bridge publishing businesses. Mr Pein say it have take most of the year since Mr Maxwell's death to prise the businesses, which include Chess Monthly and Bridge Monthly from the administrators to the Maxwell empire. 'Price Waterhouse take months and months to come up with any information about the company,' say Mr Pein. even when the new company have reach agreement to buy the business from Price Waterhouse, administrator to the public Maxwell companies they then run into trouble with Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell businesses. Mr Pein say the new company want to use and pay for the premises of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge - prefabricate buildings in the village of Wheatley, Oxfordshire - until they find permanent premises. However, he say that Arthur Andersen want two years back rent. Despite the year of difficulties, Chess and Bridge be now set up in new premises in Euston Road, London. The company say it have the large collection of chess and bridge books and products in the UK. Two writs have be file allege that Goldman Sachs, the us-based investment bank, assist in divert Pounds 55m from two pension schemes control by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid. The writs be file late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme. The trustees seek more than dollars 100m for the sale of shares plus interest, commission charges and punitive damages from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of international equities trading. The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which be transact through Goldman and for which the schemes be never paid. The writs allege Goldman be aware the trusts be control by Robert Maxwell. The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arrange for the pension fund share transaction to be pay for - Goldman be due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction sell MCC stock to an unnamed american lawyer 'with close connections to Robert Maxwell'. The writs claim that Goldman be 'competing directly with its customer, the pension fund trustee, for payment'. On April 26 1991, they say, Mr Kevin Maxwell tell Mr Sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the swiss trusts. On May 23 he tell Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman know or should have know be control by the Maxwell family. The writs allege that after the deal be strike Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension fund administrator, tell Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be pay to the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell order the proceeds to be pay to bit. The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg 'made no reasonable effort to determine who have actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sell and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m shares should go'. Goldman say it have 'received no money or other benefit from these transactions other than its brokerage commissions of Pounds 110,000 which be substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties pay to the Inland Revenue of Pounds 215,000'. Mirror's flagship publication be the tabloid Daily Mirror, with sales of three million copies daily. last month, in another money-raising move, Mr. Maxwell's Maxwell Communication Corp. sell its Pergamon Press PLC unit for #440 million. In other changes, Mr. Maxwell's son Ian, who have be appoint deputy chairman of Mirror Group, will resign from his post at Maxwell Communication, where he be joint deputy manage director. Maxwell Communication say last month that its management would be take over by Kevin Maxwell, Ian's brother. Robert Maxwell buy Mirror Group in 1984 from Reed International PLC for #113 million. Through staff cuts and heavy spending on print facilities, Mr. Maxwell build Mirror into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper groups. In 1990, Mirror have profit of #37.2 million, or 28.2 penny a share, on revenue of #445 million. Proceeds from the share flotation will be use to strengthen and refinance the group's balance sheet. About #210 million will be use to pay back bank loans and the rest to pay in full a loan from Robert Maxwell Holdings Ltd. Salomon Bros. International be underwrite the international part of the offering, cover approximately one-third of the shares on sale, to be privately place with institutional investors in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Maxwell, who put together a publishing empire following his immigration to Britain in 1940, was found dead off the coast of the Canary Islands after apparently having fallen overboard from his yacht. There are allegations that Maxwell, along with two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, and a senior executive in several Maxwell corporations, Michael Stoney, were involved in the illegal transfer of funds to help his publishing empire fend off debt. The scheme used Swiss trusts and a number of institutions, including the U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs.","Robert Maxwell has been described as the Citizen Kane of his time. The mysterious death of this larger than life individual on November 5 has left the economic affairs of Maxwell Communications Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers is a state of confusion. Maxwell was born in Czechoslovakia and immigrated to Britain in 1940 to escape the Holocaust. He put together and personally ran world-wide publishing empire that included Macmillan Publishing House in New York, Britain's Daily mirror, the Daily Record and the European and British Printing Company, and communications Corp., Britain's largest printing company. Improprieties have been alleged in the handling of funds which involve not only Robert Maxwell, but two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, as well as Michael Stoney, an executive in several Maxwell companies. At issue is the alleged improper transfer of funds in an attempt to handle his publishing empire's crushing debts. Among the interests named in the transfer of funds to two Swiss trusts, is the U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs. Maxwell also is accused of using MCC in an effort to raise funds by making late payments on the foreign market. In doing so, MCC in effect gave itself an unauthorized loan.",British entrepreneur Robert Maxwell and sons guilty of financial fraud.,British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell died in 1991 in the waters off Canary Island while on vacation.

His sons Kevin and Ian took over the business but were soon implicated along with their father in an illegal scheme to deal with crushing debts. Allegedly, unauthorized loans were acquired by using a Maxwell company to buy currency in one financial center while promising, but often failing, to make payments to another center. Some repayments were made by looting pension funds.","British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, publisher of Britain's Daily Mirror, bought the New York Daily News in 1990.

Investigators say Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in an attempt to deal with crushing debts. Some $630 million was taken from his Mirror Group pension fund without authority. His sons Kevin and Ian, who took over the business, were investigated and found guilty for their knowledge of illegal schemes using two Swiss trusts, a private UK trust company and a US investment bank to support the Maxwell Communications Company (MCC).

The Foreign Ministry thus approve the intervention by the Argentine corvette when it discover the korean ship Chin Yuan Hsing violate Argentine jurisdictional waters on 21 May. The Argentine Navy report today that the corvette Spiro stay near the Korean ship ""given the adverse weather conditions, and fulfil its responsibilities of sea search and rescue."" The Korean ship, which have be fish illegally in Argentine waters, be sink by its own crew after fail to answer to the Argentine ship's warnings. The crew be transfer to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which be sail nearby and approach to rescue the crew of the sinking ship. The Navy report that around 15 nautical miles off the coast of Malvinas and ""in accordance with bilateral agreements with Great Britain, the Spiro transfer assistance responsibility to british authorities."" The Foreign Ministry say ""an understanding with the UK for operations in cases of uninterrupted persecution of illegally fish ships be implemented.""

An Argentine supply ship that run aground off Antarctica sink Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there be concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment. The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso follow warnings from the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship be to spill. No injuries be report in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the crew have be evacuate from the vessel, which be 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Salvage efforts have be hamper by 50 mph winds. The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the government news agency Telam said, cite a navy communique. Telam do not say whether the ship break up or if diesel oil spill when it go down. The depth of the water in which the ship sank be not immediately known. The ship have be carry supplies include jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science Foundation say in a statement release in Washington. The ship run aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's tip. It sustain a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel begin leaking, wash ashore near Palmer station. The fuel kill some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that be a vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and have affect penguins, sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation statement said. There be no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings. Agency spokesman Jack Renerie say Tuesday before the ship sink that the leak, which be threaten penguins and other wildlife, have stopped. Scientists be concern that some research search projects may already have be affect by the leak, a foundation statement said. It say two Argentine salvage vessels be expect to arrive Thursday or Friday. Before the sinking, Argentine officials have discount a spill. Telam quote Argentine navy sources as saying: The fuel it carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, be in steel drums so a spill be practically impossible. The 316 people aboard the ship when it run aground, include 82 passengers and 234 crew members, be rescue by power boats and take to Palmer Station. The passengers and most of the crew be take by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islands, from which they be airlift to the south american mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the station, say Renerie. Because the station be equip for only 40 people, food have be ration to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement said. Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party, resign today over a scandal surround the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago. Gratz, 59, be the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called Lucona scandal, the subject of a widely publicize investigation by a parliamentary committee. Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resign Jan.19. Blecha and Gratz have deny wrongdoing or aid Udo Proksch, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the indian Ocean. Six sailors died. The Lucona's cargo be officially describe by Proksch as for a uranium processing plant and insure for $16 million. The insurance company have never paid, claim the cargo be only scrap metal and allege the vessel be intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money. Proksch, want by austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud, have be variously describe to be live in Syria, the Philippines and Latin America. In several interviews, Gratz describe himself as a close friend of Proksch, but when Proksch flee to escape prosecution, Gratz criticize him. Gratz tell Parliament today he would give up his seat in February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious posts in Austria. My decision be a personal one and it be politically motivated, Gratz tell the house. If it become impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody be only interested in his context in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council (parliament) in such a way as be his duty. In past newspaper stories, Gratz be accuse of provide fabricate evidence from abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment be for a uranium processing plant. Gratz, who deny the allegations, be also accuse of help Proksch in several other ways. Like Blecha, Gratz be to appear before the parliamentary investigation committee. A freighter carry a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members be rescue from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said. The ship sink at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28 nautical miles north of the island of Ameland. It be not immediately clear what have cause the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, accord to the coast guard spokesman, who be not identified. There be no casualties, he said. The coast guard official, who speak in a dutch radio interview, identify the ship involve as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra and say it have be carry a cargo of beer. He do not give the ship's origin or destination. The nine crew members board two life rafts after the sinking in high winds. They be take ashore by a west german helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the sinking, the official said. A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rush to the scene. Earlier reports have say that the ship be a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships ply the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland. Freight shipping in the area be also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany. A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggest that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy be scuttle by its own crew rather than sink by the british in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard say Thursday. During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard describe how he his ocean-crawling robot locate the Bismarck sit upright and proud two weeks ago. then the american oceanographer, whose father be of british background and whose mother be of german heritage, address himself to the german people in German. I be an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter, he said, translate himself back into English. We find no human remains. We touch nothing and take nothing. ... The future of the Bismarck be in the hands of the german people. He say he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship, which sink after a battle May 27, 1941. Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, say structural evidence satisfy him that the Germans scuttle the battleship rather than try to surrender or allow her to be send down by british fire. only scuttle ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece, Ballard said. It appear the crew open it up along its entire length. It be clearly flooded, stem to stern. maybe the Germans didn't want it take as a war prize, he added. It be know that two years earlier, Hitler order the german pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttle after it be corner in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attack by british ships. Hitler apparently want to keep the british from learn the secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons. In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns be quickly knock out and the attack british ships be out of range of her secondary guns, Ballard said, so its be helpless and take hundreds of hits its sink clearly inevitable. render unsteerable by torpedoes drop by tiny fabric-covered british biplanes, it be unable to escape. Asked if the german commander couldn't have surrender by cease fire, Ballard say in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas it would have be unlikely that the British would have recognize that the Germans be give up. Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans do not want the ship's technologically advanced equipment to fall into british hands. The Bismarck be find by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France. He say it be in remarkably good shape, elegant, well preserved. Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill have leave convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ring three-word command: Sink the Bismarck! Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived. british ships pick up 110 survivors but leave with hundreds of german sailors still in the icy waters after spot what might have be a german u-boat. German vessels later rescue only five more survivors. The story have be recount in books, songs and a movie. The sinking occur only eight days after the Bismarck leave Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have pose a critical threat to convoy of merchant shipping and undercut british morale at a time when England stand virtually alone against combined german sea and air power. The british send the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within five days of go to sea the Bismarck have sink the Hood in a three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the vessel's crew of 1,419. The Hood be a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stun the british public and the war government and make sink the Bismarck a mission of crucial importance. Ballard say under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remain the property of the german people. The sunken battleship be discover and photograph by the same remote-controlled robot that Ballard use four years ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the british passenger liner that sink in 1912 after strike an iceberg. A yacht build for Adolf Hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the voyage of the Damned be mistakenly drop on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane, officials say Tuesday. They're go to have to move it, say Coast Guard spokeswoman Veronica Cady. The 85-foot Ostwind yacht be suppose to become an artificial reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast. It be sink June 4, 50 years after the U.S. Coast Guard turn away the SS St. Louis as its more than 900 jewish passengers be seek refuge from the Holocaust. The sinking site be suppose to be near where the Coast Guard intercept the St. Louis, whose passengers also be turn away by Cuba and force to return to Europe. Most of the passengers later die in Nazi concentration camps. For unexplained reasons, the Ostwind be push off a barge about a mile north of the site, and be rest in 25 feet of water on a living reef. It be truly an incredible, incredible historic event, and suddenly boom! somebody make a mistake, say Mayor Abe Resnick, a Holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event. Federal and Dade County officials who allow Resnick to sink the boat be upset about the result. They didn't even come close, complain Susan Markely, an administrator with Dade's environmental department. Coast Guard Lt. Al Crespo say the yacht be balance on a delicate living reef, threaten damage to coral and sponges. It's also close to an anchor spot for freighters and other vessels head to the port of Miami and have be mark with a flashing buoy, he said. It's close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor, it could hit it, Crespo said. The Army Corps of Engineers say the Ostwind must be move or cut to pieces by June 22. If it's not, the government will remove it and bill Resnick. Resnick blame the mistake on A.M. Daly Jr., captain of the tug that tow the yacht to where it be sunk. Daly, however, say Chris Cadley, captain of a passenger boat that accompany him, have agree to lead him to the site. Cadley deny that, say he only agree to meet Daly off the coast. Resnick say someone will have to pay. I think's that's go to end up be decide by attorneys, say Ben Mostkoff, the county's artificial reef director. The Ostwind be build at Hitler's direction, although he rarely use it. After World War II, the badly decay boat wound up in the hands of a Jacksonville marina owner. A Florida couple say their pleasure boat be sink by whales off Costa Rica and they survive 66 days at sea by eat raw fish and drinking purify water, the U.S. Coast Guard report Sunday. William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, be weak but recover at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after be rescue by a costa rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, say U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo. The survivors tell authorities they lose about 50 pounds each from the ordeal, say Vallecillo, who speak to the couple by telephone early Sunday. The U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Command be headquarter in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco. William Butler tell Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure boat Sibonay be attack and sink by several whales on June 15 about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica. They be large, accord to Mr. Butler, Vallecillo said. But he didn't know how many whales. The couple's last radio contact be June 13, when they talk to their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said. Vallecillo say he'd heard of boats run into marine mammals when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there be any recorded cases of whale aggression. This happen in the early morning hours with good visibility, he said. This be the first (case) I've documented. As the boat be sinking, the couple said, they grab fish rods and a salt-water purifier and and get into a rubber lifeboat, where they remain for the next two months, Vallecillo said. As the lifeboat drift slowly eastward over two months, the Butlers said, they catch between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survive multiple shark attacks by seal punctures with a raft repair kit. Butler tell U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times the couple spot merchant ships but be unable to flag them down. On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship make its fisheries patrol about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spot the raft and rescue the couple. They be sail from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, where they plan to vacation, Vallecillo said. Butler be an experienced sailor, he said. Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, be fly to Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunite with their parents, Vallecillo said. Greek divers have plunge 162 feet beneath the Aegean Sea and back into history, find a treasure-laden turkish warship sunk by greek revolutionaries in 1822. The remains of the wooden sailing ship be find near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, accord to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert. The Bourloti Seimaz or Explosives Invincible be set afire and sunk by greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for turkish killing and loot on Chios. Thousands of islanders die in the Turkish raids, which shock other nations and swung western european countries behind the greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greece win independence in 1830. The french painter Eugene Delacroix produce a famous picture, The Massacre of Chios, base on the raids. It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book we use to read in school about the War of Independence, Nicolaides say in an interview Friday with The Associated Press. Nicolaides, who hear about the wreck while teach an underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, start query fishermen about where their nets snag on seabed obstacles. He pinpoint the wreck on May 3, he said. When I dived, I find ships' timbers stick out of the muddy seabed and dozens of objects Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls, a candlestick, even a chalice from a greek Orthodox church, he said. The ship be obviously cram with loot from Chios. I think there may be gold and silver items as well, he said. I also saw what I recognize as human bones, he added. He say the wreckage indicate the vessel be at least 100 feet in length. accord to historians, more than 1,000 people include 400 greek captives be aboard the ship when Kanaris stag his attack in the early hours of June 7, 1822. The greek admiral sail from the nearby island of Psara, tow a boat stuffed with explosives. Its pointed bow be ram into the mouth of a cannon on the Bourloti Seimaz and a fuse lit. The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, be kill in the blast that split the ship. Kanaris and his crew of Greeks escaped. This be a very significant, very emotive find, come from this particular period of history, say George Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine archaeology. Papathanassopoulos say the 162-foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely be attempt at depths over 113 feet, but he said, This be a ship that must be explored. Nicolaides say he hop it would be possible to tap american and turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international project. american experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A & M University, work in cooperation with turkish divers, have pioneer underwater excavation off the turkish Aegean coast. Greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and survey historic wrecks scatter around the Aegean and rarely carry out excavations. Ferries be among the safe vessels afloat. But, as the tragic sinking of the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high. As ferries increase in size, so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up. The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel have increase the risk that, once the sea penetrate the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its members, the ship-owning nations, have devote much thought over the past two decades to ship safety. But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety. particularly worry be the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrate the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987. Unlike the Herald, the Estonia appear to have have its doors closed, but ro-ros be undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration. Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues. First the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered. Additional stability could be provide by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulges which project from the ship's side just above the water line. Greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtain by instal moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks. These proposals be look at by the british government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise. It calculate that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the UK ferry fleet, with a further Pounds 22m in extra annual run costs. high costs would inevitably lead to high fares - unwelcome to ferry operators when, on the short cross-channel routes, they face competition from the Channel tunnel. But the difficulty of push through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster. Second, the IMO and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of exist regulations. The IMO have be try to move enforcement up its agenda, but it depend on the good will and professionalism of governments and shipowners. Third, the IMO should be give support by national governments in its campaign, launch yesterday, to improve crew training. Much of the regulation in recent years have concentrate on improve the ship and its equipment. Above all, if new regulation do turn out to be necessary, it must be introduce speedily. As things stand, it can take years before changes be ratify by enough governments to give them force. The European Union, which Sweden and Finland be get ready to join, could take a lead in speed up the process. Ship safety be not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector. Five (small) ferries be lose last year, accord to Lloyd's Register. But this figure pal into insignificance compare with the 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also go down. When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew go down in a distant ocean, very little attention be paid. If the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in european waters can make shipping safety a high priority for governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the Estonia. Two sailors be miss Monday evening after a 652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sink in rough seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod. Twenty-three crew members be rescued. The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria be find on a lifeboat and pick up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett say in New York. They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes, Midgett said. The two miss sailors be believe to be on a life raft, which be the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search planes, officials said. The Ravenscraig's crew spot a second life raft, but it turn out to be empty. The cause of the sinking be not immediately known, officials said. The Star of Alexandria have be en route from Athens, Greece, to New York with a load of cement when it begin take on water in 12-foot seas and wind up to 35 mph, Midgett said. The first mayday call go out at 9:05 a.m. A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a c-130 plane from Elizabeth City, N.C., converge on the ship. The lifeboat be spot around noon. The C-130 be able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carry the 23 crew members and they be able to establish communications, Midgett said. About four hours later, they be rescue by the Ravenscraig. The Star of Alexandria be not spotted, and be presume to be sink or sunk, Midgett said. Visibility in the rough sea be five to eight miles Monday afternoon. The Star of Alexandria be build in 1966, and be register in England. It be design to carry bulk freight, and be own by Caribene Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, accord to Bureau Veritas, a paris-based shipping registry.

He insist that Tower be the best man for the job and he speak out repeatedly for his choice, even after it be clear that the nomination be doomed. But he didn't get nasty about it, say there be no point in escalate the fight. That's over, he say 24 hours after the Tower defeat. That's history. And now we be go to go forward. The 53-47 vote against Tower be a setback to Bush in the sense that it always be a defeat when Congress deny a president something he wants. But this denial do not cost Bush a program, or a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters. Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate do the president a favor by send Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon. It be a break Bush could not make with a political ally who have be after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan be elect president. Tower have not be a Reagan man he have support Bush for the 1980 nomination. And the Reagan White House go to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought, declare that the new president would not be nominate any Senate Republican for any Cabinet post. After Tower's long wait, Bush display his own loyalty, all the way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safe course would have be to withdraw the nominee. Tower not only shun withdrawal; he offer conditions that have to be humiliating, if only the Senate would let him have the job. Tower promise to quit drinking, take the pledge on national television. And when that didn't work, he offer to become the first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans propose that he get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have change the system and could have haunt the presidency. No deal. so Tower become the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be rejected, the first who be a former senator. Bush say he have be fight for the right of a president to appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoid language that would have raise the political stakes. Tower do not restrain himself. Battling for the job, he say withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be damn the president's judgment. He say his nomination have be turn into a vehicle for a major presidential defeat. Tower's advocate on the Senate floor say grave constitutional issues be at stake, that the authority of the presidency be on the line, that the Senate will come to rue the rules it write in the Tower decision. But Bush say all along that the outcome, either way, would not hurt on other issues. Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed. He tell his Georgia constituents that the Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's leadership. In Washington, `triumphs' and `setbacks' be short-lived, Nunn said, and that's particularly true of the president. Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said. Senator Tower be rest comfortably and be list in fair condition, hospital spokesman Steve Habgood say Thursday night. The senator be expect to make a full recovery. Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, be admit to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergo a colonscopy examination last week that reveal the polyp, Habgood said. A preliminary biopsy of the polyp show it be benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announce Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas. Thursday's surgery take approximately three hours, Habgood said. When Tower undergo the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also be discover and removed. Tests of that growth show it to contain some malignant but well differentiated cells, Habgood said. Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who be unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said. After leave the Senate in 1985, Tower go into business as a defense consultant. He also serve as an arms negotiator for President Reagan and he head the White House's Iran-Contra investigative panel. President-elect Bush designate Tower as his defense secretary on Dec. 16. The nomination be subject to Senate approval. Defense Secretary-designate John Tower contradict an early sworn statement when he tell the Senate his work for a british firm involve no military matters, accord to reports publish Saturday. Meanwhile, new questions be raise about the thoroughness of the FBI's background investigation of the embattled nominee. One newspaper report that several bizarre accidents, include early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently be overlook in the probe. The Senate Armed Services Committee have put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it take a second look at Tower's personal habits, include his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors. Tower, who have decline to be interview while his nomination be pending, have deny in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concern his business ties. A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, decline on Saturday to comment on the late reports, say it's (the nomination) before the committee. Tower's designate spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, do not answer a reporter's call Saturday. In write testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower say he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities in connection with his work for the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace, Inc. That statement, accord to two publications, The Los Angeles Times and the Legal Times, do not square with information which Tower provide to divorce attorneys work for his second wife in June of 1987. In the divorce deposition, Tower say he go to work for british Aerospace eight weeks after resign as the nation's chief strategic arms negotiator and advise the company on how to sell train jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon, the Los Angeles Times reported. Tower tell the Senate committee he work chiefly on sell commercial aircraft to U.S. airlines and also advise the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuations. He say he earn $265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December. The Legal Times say Tower tell the divorce attorneys that he be retain by british Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the Pentagon, and that he list the various weapons involved. The deposition be never file in court because Tower do not contest the divorce, but a copy be obtain by the FBI, the Legal Times said. It say its reporters be allow by attorneys to read it with the understanding that it not be quote directly. The New York Post report Saturday that the FBI apparently have not bother to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involve Tower. The Post, cite syndicate columnist Cody Shearer, say the incidents include an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when Tower be trap in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he accidentally set by drop a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair. When firemen break into his room to remove him, he be reportedly in no condition to free himself, the Post said. The newspaper also say Tower wreck his car in two early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and, two years earlier, he drive into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way home from work. The youth be not seriously hurt. FBI spokesman Bill Carter refuse comment on specifics of the Tower investigation, but say We will follow any lead. On Friday, Tower authorize the release of a statement that recent hospital tests show no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice President Dan Quayle said, I have never see drink be a factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine. Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledge that there be no question that Tower sometimes drink too much in the early 1970s, but he said: He be not an alcoholic. He's not have a drinking problem for years. Another victim be Dr. Nicholas Davies, president-elect of the American College of Physicians, a 60,000-member industry group, say Dr. Louis Felder, who work with Davies at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. none of the 20 passengers or three crew members aboard Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2311 survived.; The crash follow by one day the plane-helicopter collision that kill Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and six other people.; Tower, 65, and his daughter Marian, 35, board the 30-passenger, turboprop Embraer 120 in Atlanta and be head to Sea Island, off the Georgia coast, for a party in Tower's honor.; Officials say they do not know the cause of the crash. The plane be descend in clear weather, authorities said, when it go down at 2:47 p.m. about three miles northeast of the runway at the Brunswick-Glynco Jetport.; Witnesses say the plane appear to have fall straight from the sky.; ""it just go straight down. There be no cropping of trees,"" say Lt. Jack Hopper of the Glynn County Police Department, quote witnesses.; ""it start in on its nose, and I know it be in trouble,"" say James Griner, who live a quarter-mile from the airport. ""I go to the plane, but I couldn't get to it because of the fire. . . . When I get to it, it look compacted.""; Atlantic Southeast's senior vice president, John Beiser, say officials have no indication from the pilot that the flight be in trouble.; Donald Day, the airline's manager of consumer affairs, describe the aircraft as ""extremely sophisticated and fuel-efficient, one of the backbones of our commuter fleet."" He say the plane be new and have be put in service in December.; The Brazilian-made Embraer 120 be manufacture by Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA. In 1984, an Embraer 110 Bandeirante, an early model of the 120, crash in Jacksonville, Fla., kill 13 people. The Federal Aviation Administration subsequently order an inspection of all Embraers for possible shear or worn rivets in the tail sections.; Tower's death prompt words of grief and praise among his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, even those who help derail his elevation to the Cabinet in 1989.; ""I'm deeply sadden by the loss of John Tower, a tough, able friend and patriot,"" say Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who break ranks with most Democrats to support President Bush's nomination of the 24-year Senate veteran to be defense secretary. ""He be intelligent and have independence of judgment.""; Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who lead the successful fight against Tower's confirmation, said: ""America have lose a patriot. . . . He fight for freedom and work diligently to make the world more secure.""; ""It's so sad,"" Bush said. ""it be a tragic loss."" Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issue a terse statement Tuesday support defense-secretary designate John Tower but refuse to comment on a publish report that he tell Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that tower use to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting. An unidentified congressional source tell The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drink habits in the 1970s come down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, like a ton of bricks and be a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination. The newspaper report that Combest later give a different story to the FBI, say that Tower and a group of friends not Tower alone have frequently consume a bottle of scotch. After meet with staff and advisers, Combest, who work for then-sen. Tower in the 1970s, issue a two-sentence statement support his fellow Texan. As a member of Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this country's arm forces. In my judgment, John Tower will be a superb secretary of defense, the statement said. Combest spokesman Rich Adams refuse to comment further, and say Combest be not available to speak to reporters. The Washington Post report that Combest describe for Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s. A congressional source be quote as say that Combest tell the senators that Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week. Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, tell the Post that Combest originally go to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower have end his previous excessive abuse of alcohol. Boyd also tell the Post that a group of people drink the entire bottle of scotch, not Tower alone. That be the account Combest give the FBI follow his talk with Nunn and Warner, the newspaper said. It say that in that account, Combest say that he have only see Tower drunk on two or three occasions. Tower have acknowledge that he drink excessively in the 1970s, but say he have reduce his intake to wine with dinner. On Sunday, he promise to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirm as defense secretary. Combest, 43, work for Tower for seven years, 1971-1978, as a legislative assistant handle agricultural legislation and policy. Tower serve in the Senate for 24 years, decide not to seek re-election in 1984. He be chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1981 through 1984. The committee, now control by Democrats, vote 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject Tower's nomination. You would obviously expect Mr. Tower to say no, and he obliges: volubly and passionately. If that be all there be to ""consequences,"" we could scan the dust jacket and invest our savings in local real estate. ""Consequences"" read a bit like a political Stephen King story as the small senator swell into a Beltway monster. Politics never have be for the squeamish, but the Tower controversy leave a much more disagreeable taste than do the senator's caperings (which mostly take place in the '70s anyway). Were the write less stiff and the narrative technique less choppy, ""consequences"" might have be a classic case study of late 20th-century politics out of control. Given Mr. Tower's qualifications for the job -- intelligence, patriotism and past chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee -- the nomination should have sail through with fly colors. instead it sink like the Bismarck. Clearly and apparently to his surprise, Mr. Tower have make many enemies since his arrival in Washington in 1961, often rub even supporters the wrong way. The senator from the Lone Star State could be lordly, in his english-cut suits. Once, meeting with the editors of my newspaper which have back him strongly, he think nothing of tilt back in his chair, cross his tiny, well-shod feet atop the conference table. When the Tower hearings opened, all manner of accusations come to public notice. The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claim to have see the senator consort with A Lady not His wife. It be report that Mr. Tower have chase a secretary around his desk and have fondle women at Bergstrom Air Force Base. The second wife, whom the senator have recently divorced, possess a repertory of tales she cheerfully volunteered. At his hotel, Mr. Tower be accord that doubtful tribute to instant-celebrity status, the media stakeout. The nominee issue fervent denials: He drink only wine, have long since swear off scotch; he'd never chase secretaries; his services for defense-industry clients have be proper and modest. none of the charges, at least on Mr. Tower's showing, prove to have the least substance. No use. Dirt be dirty than purity be pure, as one of John O'Hara's characters observes. Sen. Sam Nunn, Mr. Tower's successor as Armed Services Committee chairman, seem initially to smile on the nomination; then the rumor mill start churn and he change fronts. While endeavor to look statesmanlike, Sen. Nunn lean on moderate Democrats who would otherwise have support Tower. Sen. Nunn make the campaign personal, say Mr. Tower -- vote for me or vote for him. most Democrats, in the end, go with Sen. Nunn. What be all this about? Morality? Mr. Tower suggest instead that Sen. Nunn, a presidential hopeful, discover and seize an opportunity to show who be really no. 1 on national defense. Sen. Nunn have every reason to know that the moral and ethical charges level at Mr. Tower, and investigate exhaustively by the FBI, be flimsy. Yet he wave them about anyway. When the media retail lurid and unsubstantiated stories, Sen. Nunn purse his lips like a Georgia Sunday-school superintendent and suggest that a drunken Mr. Tower might accidentally press the nuclear button. ""Sam Nunn,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""used the FBI inquiries to discredit me and to strike at the president of the United States. The essential chain of good judgment and goodwill break down during my confirmation process."" Sen. Nunn have company on Mr. Tower's dishonor roll. There be Sen. Ernest Hollings (""a study in arrogance and pomposity""), Sen. James Exon (""one of the most excessive regular boozers in the Senate"") and NBC's Andrea Mitchell (""the most viciously partisan reporter I've ever seen""), along with the Washington press corps. Sen. John Warner, a Republican, be depict as fall all over himself to stay in good with Sen. Nunn. Mr. Tower feels, not without reason, that he be arraign on morals charges by cynical colleagues and media personages whom no one ever mistake for Southern Baptist deacons. ""i don't so much resent my rejection by the Senate,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""as the way it be done."" ""Tower, you be lynched,"" Mike Wallace, the CBS correspondent, tell him. Worse yet, the lynch mob remain at large. --- Mr. Murchison be a senior columnist for the Dallas Morning News. The democratic-controlled Senate today reject the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, deliver a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term. The Senate's 53-47 vote come after a bitter and divisive debate focus on Tower's drink habits, behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors. It be only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate have vote to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it have do so early in a new administration. Vice President Dan Quayle preside over the Senate during the roll call, underscore Bush's commitment to the nominee. The Senate galleries be pack and virtually all senators be in their seats as the roll be called. The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense be not confirmed, Quayle intone after the vote. Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provide the big surprise of the final hours of debate when she become the sole Republican to declare her opposition. She say her most serious concerns be over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serve as an arms control negotiator. She also express doubts that he would pay enough attention to ensure fairness for women in the military. Tower's Republican defenders begin to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appear to accept defeat, even before the roll be called. Just moments ago I take a call from John Tower, say Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. His head be high, his voice be strong, Warner said. He ask me to convey thanks in his words to the troops who rally to his support. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, move to repair damage cause by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate and President Bush. I know what's in my heart and in my mind, he tell reporters. I want to directly, clearly and unambiguously say that this doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the president. Dole agree to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledge the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking. There be no doubt about the outcome as the Senate go through the motions of debate the nomination through the final hours before the roll call. The last few undecided senators declare their positions. Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., say he would vote against Tower. Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., say he would support the nomination. Senators from both parties credit Tower's defeat to the decision to oppose him make by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee. When he make his decision all the other Democrats wheel in behind him, say Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. With the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, If necessary, we'll come up with a (new) candidate very rapidly. Names most frequently mention in White House speculation as a replacement for Tower if his nomination fail be Sen. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. Scowcroft reply No when ask this morning if he be in line for the Pentagon job. It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and the national security adviser, any number of congressmen and senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on the tip of their tongue, Fitzwater said. But the time have not come, he added. The time will come as soon as the vote be completed. We will wait until then. The most recent Associated Press survey show 52 Democrats and one Republican commit to vote against Tower or lean strongly in that direction. It show 41 Republicans and three Democrats declare for Tower or lean his way. Nevertheless, the White House say it want to see the nomination go all the way to a vote. Tower, meanwhile, report for work at the Pentagon where he and his three daughters have coffee together. He then continue a review of various administration proposals. I hope and believe we can work together on important matters, Mitchell said. The tension of this issue will have no long-lasting effect on the relationship. I want to say from the bottom of my heart that I hope this will be the case. The already slim chance Tower would be confirm be deal a crush blow on Wednesday as a parade of previously undecided democratic senators announce they would vote no. only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas say he would vote yes, join just two other Democrats who have make that decision. Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., all say they would vote against Tower. Johnston say his reading of the FBI report on Tower leave him with the clear impression that Tower's personality changes when he drink heavily, lead to a recklessness in the social sense entirely different from his behavior when sober.

8,d119i,"President Bush be expect to name a female career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country prepare for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro, accord to inform sources. The sources say Thursday it be virtually certain the appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to Mozambique. They say the administration believe a female ambassador could relate good than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who take office Wednesday. They also say the administration be eager to have more women in key posts. only rarely have U.S. ambassadorships in Latin America go to women. In choose Ms. Wells, the administration pass over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region, say the sources, who ask not to be identified. Ms. Wells, who be bear in Estonia, have no prior experience in Latin America. Her personnel record indicate she speak Spanish. Wells' name be submit to the White House by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the Managua post, and approval be consider 99.9 percent certain, one source said. The United States and Nicaragua have not have ambassadors in each other's capitals since July 1988. The sandinista government expel then-u.s. ambassador Richard Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats on the grounds they be interfere in Nicaragua's internal affairs. The Reagan administration retaliate by expel nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the nicaraguan embassy here. But a new era in u.s.-nicaraguan relations be expect to open with the inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, who defeat President Daniel Ortega in elections this February. Vice President Dan Quayle and a large congressional delegation be expect to represent Bush at her inaugural. The administration have ask Congress for $300 million in assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be use for resettle Contra rebels. But the request have be stall by Senate Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe have a great claim on U.S. resources than Nicaragua. Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986 encounter strong opposition from Senate conservatives who hold up the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward that country. The nomination finally be approve in September 1987. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up Wells' nomination, say he want to pressure the administration into deal with rightist guerrillas oppose to Mozambique's Marxist government. Mozambique have since moderate its policies and be now off the U.S. government's list of countries under Marxist rule. The Bush administration be expect to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says. The administration have plan to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but have a change of heart after conclude she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she have be a target of conservatives. The administration be eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro have take over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party. Mrs. Chamorro face the demanding challenges of revive Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare. The United States have have no ambassador to Nicaragua since July 1988. At the time, the Sandinista government expel Ambassador Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they be interfere in the country's internal affairs.

In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman be the top Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President Reagan. The U.S. official say Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several of his conservative allies would not assure the administration that they would not delay Wells' nomination.

Sarbanes say the appointments be lard the diplomatic corp with amateurs reward for purely political services. Political throwaways, Sarbanes call them. I think the time have come, very frankly, to get off the money merry-go-round and ask some very difficult questions, essentially about when extensive political contributions be go to be a sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination, Sarbanes tell the committee last month. It's not true in every instance, but in most of these cases you seem to have to be over the $100,000 mark in order to make the consideration list, Sarbanes said.

At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledge to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he have be in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast. But Pell say he be unpersuaded. Tact and careful speech be hallmarks of successful diplomats, Pell said. Mr. Secchia have demonstrate that he would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to Italy. Italian friends of mine telephone me from Rome, aghast at the prospect of have Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their country, the chairman said.

Lucille Ball possess the gift of laughter. But she also embody an even great treasure the gift of love, President Bush say in a statement. She appeal to the gentler impulses of the human spirit. She be not merely an actress or comedienne. She be Lucy and she be loved. Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life make her an american institution, former President and Nancy Reagan say in a statement. Just the mention of her name bring a smile. ... We love Lucy and will miss her deeply. It's a shock after work very closely with her and love her for over 35 years, say Miss Ball's frequent sidekick, Gale Gordon, who be in Edmonton, Alberta. While in the hospital, the comedian be deluge with thousands of cards, letters, flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as Australia and Europe. Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, star in I love lucy from 1951 to 1957 and have be see since in widely syndicate reruns. The late vivian Vance and William Frawley play their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz. Her split-second timing, wide-mouthed wails and exaggerated pratfalls make the I love Lucy show one of the most popular in television history. Bridge clubs and bowl teams change their meeting nights to watch Lucy and Ethel cook up still another ridiculous scheme that would push their long-suffering husbands to exasperation. Miss Ball's real, onscreen pregnancy mark a milestone in television, and an estimate 44 million viewers more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower tune in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky. The real birth occur just four hours before the previously-filmed show be broadcast. Miss Ball's singularity as a comedian be match by her talent as a show-business entrepreneur. She and Arnaz establish one of TV's first major independent studios. Desilu, as their production company be called, make some of the top comedy shows of the 1950s and '60s, include December Bride, Our Miss Brooks and Make Room for Daddy. As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and Arnaz sign an $8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953 the large in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any tv star can touch today. The couple stop make weekly I love Lucy shows in 1957. Despite riches and two children, Lucie and Desi Jr., their marriage foundered, and the couple divorce in 1960. In 1961, Miss Ball marry nightclub comic Gary Morton, who become her executive producer, and remain on tv for 12 more years in the weekly Here's Lucy and The Lucy Show.

In all, she appear in more than 75 movies. In 1940, her tresses color the fiery trademark red, Miss Ball meet Arnaz, a rumba star. They marry within six months. In 1951, when CBS decide to move her radio series, My Favorite Husband, to television, Miss Ball insist that Arnaz be her co-star. But the network wasn't sure Arnaz would be a hit with the american public. The couple go on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved audiences would watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a cuban-born band leader with a heavy accent.

12,d103g,"Iran be deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seek to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say. The regime be very much fearful of public outrage, say Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran. They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks. As Gobadi speak Friday, members of the organization denounce iran's government at a noisy rally hold in a park across the street from the White House. Northern Iran be stick Thursday by an earthquake measure between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale. Iran have tell the United Nations that the death toll be at least 36,000, but Gobadi say his organization have receive estimates closer to 100,000. Gobadi say the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury have be spend in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition. They have be very late in assist the people, he said. Sympathy for the earthquake victims be a secondary issue for the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carry signs criticize their native country. Planning for the event begin three weeks before the earthquake, but part of the Friday's activities focus on Iran's stricken residents. Gobadi say shoddy housing in which the government force people to live be the cause for the widespread loss of life. This regime have bring them nothing but devastation and misery. This regime have devote all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home, he said. A u.n.-sponsored cease-fire be declare last year after eight years of the Iran-Iraq war. Iran's Islamic republic be establish in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi be depose by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and militants seize the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, take 66 Americans hostage.

Gobadi say his 25-year-old group have help depose the shah but have no part in organize the Islamic republic. even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in Iran, Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., tell an estimate 3,000 people attend the rally.

An anti-american newspaper in Iran say Sunday the United States be partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake. The criminal role of America in Iran's past become evident once again in the recent earthquake, the Jomhuri Islami say in an editorial report by the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Our people, even under the rubble, chant `death to America' and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States ... even those hands stretch out to help, it said. It argue that by plunder Iran's oil and other resources for 25 years, the United States have prevent the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development projects and advance (anti-seismic) building construction systems. even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government by impose economic sanctions and launch several other plots, halt the renovation of the country, the editorial added. The newspaper be imply that with these actions the United States have block the diversion of funds to earthquake safety measures.

The 7.7-magnitude quake be the large ever record in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said. Iran be in a very active seismic region, he said, and that there have be many small quakes. Twelve earthquakes great than magnitude 7 have occur in Iran during the last 30 years, Needham said.

Yeltsin's second talent be his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the Soviet Communist Party, the world from which both he and Gorbachev emerged.;gorbachev could never shuck his party apparatchik's skin. instead of reach out to new ideas and new people as Yeltsin has, he surround himself with traditional Communist Party officials and worry about the impact of new schemes and ideas. Gorbachev think Vladimir Kryuchkov of the KGB, Boris Pugo of the Ministry of Interior, Dmitri Yazov of the Red Army and Gennady Yanayev of the Communist Party be necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative forces that hat his reforms. Instead, they turn out to be mortal enemies.;if they have be only personal enemies, Gorbachev might have be undone by them. But when they close the new, liberal news media and revert to the Stalinist tradition of the big lie, the members of the State Emergency Committee threaten not just Gorbachev but also the new Soviet Union -- a society that offer its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for dignity, self-reliance and freedom. For years, Soviets and western Kremlinologists have debate whether the changes that create this new Soviet Union be irreversible. Tuesday, it become clear that they were.;of course, Gorbachev initiate those changes, and history will credit him for that. He also refuse to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently ask him to endorse last weekend.;it be intrigue in assess the coup's failure that men train as thugs by some of the most violent and mean-spirited institutions create by any state could not, in their moment of truth, behave like thugs and kill their compatriots. They leave Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin at large; they let the western media report their coup as it unfolded; and they allow foreign radio stations to broadcast news of it back into the country. even their own news media, under strict control, convey the fact that there be widespread resistance to their attempt coup.;by Tuesday night, the Emergency Committee be in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and this prove an unequal contest. As Gorbachev have previously discover in his negotiations with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the legitimacy provide by the 50 million votes that yeltsin receive in the elections for president of the russian federation be a formidable political force.;at first blush, the botching of the coup be surprising -- couldn't the vaunted KGB and its allies run an efficient putsch? But these be representatives of the political class that turn one of the world's rich nations into a basket case. perhaps their coup should be see as a desperate and forlorn effort to deny a truth that prove undeniable -- that the Stalinist system have fail so utterly there be simply no way to redeem it. Gorbachev choose to ignore warnings about the right's impend attempt to seize power. Some warnings come from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup. But, incredibly, the clearest signals come from the hard-liners themselves.;a lead conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, know as the ""nightingale of the General Staff,"" publish a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov. With remarkable candor, Baklanov call for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union. Needless to say, Baklanov deliver on that warning and join the Gang of Eight.;Gorbachev ignore these warnings.;To some -- an admitted minority -- the thought of a Gorbachev conspiracy be comfortably within the range of the traditional soviet art of deception know as maskirovka. And to laymen, something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power.;the most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory come directly from Gorbachev himself, in his Thursday news conference in which he describe his three days under house arrest in the Crimea.;Among the questions: If Gorbachev's 32 arm guards remain loyal to him throughout, why be there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notify the president of the coup? Why didn't the coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or at least separate them from him?;if Gorbachev's contact with the outside world be limit to intercept western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio, how be he able to describe the news conference give by the collaborators, down to his view of their trembling hands?;it be highly unlikely that the hard-liners have be set up or order by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing. Such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.;a more plausible scenario be that Gorbachev be initially a full member of the conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have cling to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwart the new Union Treaty, to have be sign last Tuesday, which provide for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics.;it be possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev have decide to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence.;gorbachev do reveal, however, that two important officials have visit him in Crimea at the outset of the coup. One be head of the KGB department responsible for the security of soviet leaders; the other be V. Boldin, Gorbachev's close aide, by the president's own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him. One can't help but wonder whether these two visitors come to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise.;conspiracy theorists grope for motives -- Gorbachev want to ferret out disloyal elements in his government, to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessen his powers. But there be virtually unanimous agreement on one point. Gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who front the coup and keep them in power despite their vocal mutterings about him. Cut to a row of dour Communists in ill-fitting gray suits announce Gorbachev's illness and a palace coup. The camera zoom in on the impassive face of the two men last see in Gorbachev's office.;What be go on here?;ok, it's a hackneyed device that would only work in the movies. But then, this week's events in the Soviet Union have all the makings of a spy thriller.;Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories be work overtime, though they insist that their dark imaginings be clearly labeled ""pure speculation."";""once you have a palace coup, the possibilities be endless,"" say Robert Conquest, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution. ""russian politics be full of very strange things."";for all we know, Conquest joked, Gorbachev could be inject with drugs to change his personality or KGB scientists could produce a body-double to impersonate him.;""his friends would know, but would you or i?"" Conquest said. ""That would be go a bit far."";a more intriguing scenario have Gorbachev conspire with the coup plotters to engineer a transformation of the soviet political landscape. The thinking go like this:;with his popularity at rock bottom, Gorbachev, a lifelong creature of the KGB, hatch a false coup in order to step out of the way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other. The coup fall apart and Gorbachev triumphantly return with a level of legitimacy he never enjoy before.;the theory could explain the apparent bungling of the coup plotters, say author Joseph Finder, whose 1991 novel, ""the Moscow Club,"" foreshadow many of the elements of the current crisis.;finder, who say he do not subscribe to the scenario, nonetheless point out that tanks do not begin to roll until hours after Gorbachev's suppose arrest. Russian President Boris Yeltsin be not arrested, and Leningrad be leave alone.;speculation be not unique to Kremlin watchers in the United States.;Theorizing be rampant in the streets of Moscow on Tuesday, say San Francisco businesswoman Kimberly Getto, who send a long fax detail speculation, fuel by the fact that many of the tanks encircle the russian parliament building have no ammunition. Gorbachev do not want bloodshed, accord to the theory.;the democratic Reform Movement, head by former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's longtime ally, float the same possibility in a statement Monday.;""It's highly implausible, but not to be excluded, that Gorbachev himself agree to a withdrawal, think he'd show them they still need him,"" say Norman Naimark, director of Stanford's Center for Russian and East European Studies. ""The degree of connivance be difficult to gauge."" At the news conference -- Gorbachev's first since the coup against him collapse on Wednesday -- the 60-year-old leader condemn the takeover as be against ""the people, against democracy."";earlier, he tell reporters he would have kill himself rather than submit to any force arrangement with the coup leaders. ""I say I wouldn't make any deals,"" he say then. ""otherwise, I would have have to commit suicide."";gorbachev detail his purge of coup leaders, include Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov. He name a new act KGB chief, interior minister and defense minister, and say he would do everything to ""drive out the reactionary forces from the Communist Party."";Gorbachev pledge cooperation with russian republic President Boris Yeltsin but say he have no plans to leave the Communist Party.;""I be convince that socialism be correct. I be an adherent of socialism."";when ask if Yeltsin now have more power than he did, Gorbachev said, ""We have be bind together by the situation."";looking and sound angry, he describe the plotters as ""primitive and crude and crafty"" and scoffed at their announcement that he have step aside because he be ill. ""their hands be shake the whole time,"" he say derisively.;despite his display of anger, the Soviet president say the failure of the coup could ultimately help ensure the continuation of his reforms. ""We have to see this as an enormous opportunity,"" he said.;at his news conference, Gorbachev make a point of publicly praise Yeltsin, whose folk-hero stature be enhance during the coup as he rally hundreds of thousands of his supporters to resist.;before dawn today, Gorbachev fly back to Moscow from the Crimea, where he have be confine to his summer home during his brief ouster.;The soviet president, who be report to have sleep for a few hours in his dacha outside Moscow after return from the Crimea, arrive at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport unannounced, under heavy security. He look somewhat disheveled, clad in a windbreaker and a shirt with open collar.;appearing on soviet television after his arrival, Gorbachev look haggard and unshaven, with deep lines around his eyes and mouth. Later, at his news conference, he at first speak haltingly, but then appear to recover his composure and spoke in a forceful voice.;gorbachev say his captors cut off all communication and that his only source of news during the coup have be from foreign broadcasts, include the BBC and Voice of America, receive on a makeshift radio set up by his personal guards.;""this have be a very difficult, an extremely difficult lesson for me. It's my, you might say, my drama,"" he tell reporters.;""everything be do to weaken me psychologically,"" Gorbachev said. ""it be hard. It be hard to say it now, but that's how it was."";he say that early on in the coup, he try to find out who be behind it.;""i pick up one of the telephones I have and it wasn't working. I pick up a second, a third, a fourth . . . everything be cut off,"" he said.;""every day, morning and night, I demand . . . that my communication be restore and that an airplane be bring immediately so I could be return to Moscow,"" he said. He be be hold at his vacation home in the Crimea.;Gorbachev say the coup leaders demand that he resign.;""i said, 'You will never live that long (to see me resign).' "";He call the crisis ""one of the most difficult trials of the entire history"" of his six-year rule.;gorbachev say his 32-man personal guard stay with him throughout the coup.;the 60-year-old president say the crisis have be difficult for his family, especially his wife, Raisa, who ""took it very hard."";""best of all, my granddaughter Anastasia didn't understand anything that be go on,"" Gorbachev tell reporters. ""She want to go to the beach; that's all that concerned her. But the guards wouldn't let her go to the beach; they be concerned something would happen."";when it become clear the coup be failing, Gorbachev say he prepare himself and his family for the possibility that they would be kill by the conspirators.;""you know that it appear as though they might have do something to me. They might have kill me and my whole family and make it look as if . . . they be act in the name"" of the act president.;""these people might have do almost anything,"" he said. Gorbachev tell an audience at the russian parliament that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover. ""They want to turn us into meat. They want to annihilate us, and for that they must bear the severe responsibility,"" the Soviet president said.;he accuse the Communist Party Central Committee of panic during the coup.

14,d106g,"The arrival Wednesday of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela prompt an outpouring of praise and encouragement from politicians and supporters. A sampling of their comments: In the 15 months since he walk free from prison, Nelson Mandela have play the chief role in talks with President F.W. de Klerk and the white government. He have preside over an african National Congress divide and not yet organize for politics. He have spend his moral capital trying, unsuccessfully, to end the murderous conflict between black political factions.; now Mandela be confront with his wife's conviction for a brutal criminal offense. He have loyally defend her innocence. He have seem to hear no voice to the contrary. But events have catch up.; The radicals in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs. Mandela to arouse members against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.; There be rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to move such old leaders as Mandela and Walter Sisulu aside to a nominal senior role.; It be a gloomy picture: an elderly man bear the hopes of peace in South Africa beset by problems, personal trauma on top of political. But I think it would be wrong to conclude that the south african drama be necessarily head toward a tragic end.; One reason for a degree of optimism be the way South Africans on all sides, most of them, have deal with Winnie Mandela's trial: calmly and fairly.; During the years of white supremacy the law have be viciously misused. But from all one can tell, this trial be handle professionally by the judge, Justice Michael Stegmann.; The reaction to the verdict and six-year prison sentence be also mild. Surprisingly few supporters gather outside the court to cheer Mrs. Mandela. The ANC issue a detached statement say that the last word have not be speak in the case. Archbishop Desmond Tutu say ""the movement be large than any individual.""; A more fundamental reason for hope be that F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest in create a new, non-racial South Africa. They need each other. Without their agreement, there can be no solution, no outcome that leave a viable country.; The next step be formal negotiations. They can come only when the government take further steps to meet the reasonable ANC demand for action against violence -- in particular, a ban on the carrying of so-called ""cultural"" weapons such as spears. How can the government look away when 1,000 Zulus carry spears and machetes slaughter township residents?; The time factor be crucial now. Negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of the public, black and white, be to retain hope for a peaceful solution. World and time press on Nelson Mandela. A 3-year campaign that have succeed in get Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jail south african nationalist leader Nelson Mandela have raise objections from some faculty and students. Northeastern announce plans to award the degree honor Mandela on May 13, end a long effort by students seek to change a university policy bar honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony. The degree be to be accept by south african Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who be schedule to be in Boston for a benefit dinner. Law students last September begin a campaign of demonstrations and vigils on the campus. They hang a banner from the second floor of the law library that said: Honor Nelson Mandela. Before he be imprisoned, say third-year law student Sarah Ottinger, Nelson Mandela be an ... attorney and an activist who work against apartheid. That's the message we want convey to students. South Africa's white-minority government say it will free Mandela only if he renounce the use of violence by forces seek political power for blacks in the country. Some faculty members and students, include many blacks, have criticize the administration's plan for the event, say no effort be make to include them. I don't even know what office be sponsor it, say Keith Motley, dean and director of the african-american Institute, a student group. We get a memo from the administration say they need six ushers, but that's it. You'd think at least we'd be clue in to what's go on. This start out as something noble, something we've try to have do for three years, say Ottinger. We be very, very sorry it happen this way. It wasn't mean to turn out like this. The trustees decide in January that Mandela should get the honorary degree. Students set up a committee to contact Mandela's family to get their approval. University spokesman Paul Jones say letters be send to Mandela's wife, Winnie, and his two daughters: zenani, a student at Boston University, and Makaziwe, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. However, Northeastern still have not receive approval from the Mandela family, The Boston Globe reported. Unidentified assailants hurl a grenade and fire shots today at the home of relatives of Nelson Mandela, kill a baby girl and injure her parents, police said. African National Congress officials say the dead child and her parents be distant cousins of Nelson Mandela. They deny South african police and press reports that the child be Mandela's great-granddaughter. Police say they do not know who be responsible for the attack. No group take immediate responsibility. Police Lt. Govindesamy Mariemuthoo say the attack occur before dawn at the home of Monde Mandela in the black township of Soweto. The blast badly damage part of the house, knock holes in the wall and cause extensive damage. The police officer say a baby girl be kill and her parents injured. He give no other detail on the victims. He say the room in which the injured couple have be sleep be destroyed. ANC officials say the dead child be the great niece of Mandela's father, make her a distant cousin of Nelson Mandela. The dead girl's father, Monde Mandela, run a small grocery shop. The ANC officials say Nelson Mandela be close to the Monde Mandela family. An ANC statement said, The ANC note the curious coincidence of an attack on a man bear the Mandela name at this time. give the distant connection between Mandela and the family, police say they do not know if the attack be deliberate or just a random attack link to the general violence. Mandela be reportedly attend a political meeting in the eastern province of Natal today. Soweto and other black townships around Johannesburg have be hit by black factional fighting that have kill about 800 people since August. The fighting have pit followers of the ANC against Zulus of the conservative Inkatha group. Mandela have repeatedly accuse security forces of manipulate the violence to derail government efforts to end apartheid and share power with the black majority. The police have deny Mandela's charges. Mandela be release in February after 27 years in jail for oppose the white minority government. He be closely guard by ANC operatives, and there have be reports of threats on his life in recent months. Mandela and other ANC leaders have be negotiate with President F.W. de Klerk to pave the way for full-scale talks on end apartheid, the south african system of racial separation. De Klerk have promise to end white-minority rule. Mayor David Dinkins warn jewish groups against protest the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New York City, say the protests might insult the black community, a newspaper say today. The mayor also ask members of the organized Jewish community to dissuade more radical groups from disrupt the visit, the Daily News said. Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, will visit eight cities from June 20 to July 1. There be a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in very, very high esteem take great umbrage at any public protest, Dinkins said. I think it's sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very unwise, because this man be an international symbol of freedom and especially so see by persons of color, Dinkins tell the newspaper in an interview. Leaders of several jewish-american organizations plan to meet Mandela on Sunday in Geneva. The organizations want the south african leader to clarify his position on Israel. Mandela have embrace Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in public and have compare the struggle of Palestinians to that of black South Africans. Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announce his coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandela's public welcome in New York because of the anti-apartheid leader's unbend anti-israel stance. City councilman Noach Dear and state assemblyman Dov Hikind say if Mandela do not make a strong statement in support of Israel, they would take out ads in newspapers and hold demonstrations. Four imprisoned African National Congress leaders, convict in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, be allow to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist say today. The four men, all hold at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, be take to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spend about six hours with Mandela, say Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend of the Mandelas.

A representative of the African National Congress say Saturday the South african government may release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela as early as Tuesday. There be very strong rumors in South Africa today that on Nov. 15 Nelson Mandela will be released, say Yusef Saloojee, chief representative in Canada for the ANC, which be fight to end white-minority rule in South Africa. Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jail 27 years ago, be sentence to life in prison for conspire to overthrow the south african government. He be transfer from prison to a hospital in August for treatment of tuberculosis. Since then, it have be widely rumor Mandela will be release by Christmas in a move to win strong international support for the south african government. It will be a victory for the people of South Africa and indeed a victory for the whole of Africa, Saloojee tell an audience at the University of Toronto. A South african government source last week indicate recent rumors of Mandela's impend release be orchestrate by members of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into take some action. And a prominent anti-apatheid activist in South Africa say there have be no indication (mandela) would be release today or in the near future. Apartheid be South Africa's policy of racial separation.

During the October events he leave the White House with a head wound and be take to hospital. After a long interval Viktor Alksnis hold a news conference today in the Slavjanskaya Hotel. He begin it with a short statement, the essence of which come down to the fact that the adoption of the Latvian citizenship law violate not only human rights, but create the conditions for a conflict similar, in his opinion, to the ones in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. It be not only the latvian Government Alksnis accuse of this, but also the United States. accord to him, during the late visit to the United States by [latvian President] Guntis Ulmanis, sanction be obtain for the adoption of the aforementioned discriminatory law.

In his opinion, only joint efforts can bring this information to the attention of world public opinion, point out the seriousness of this issue, and avoid the come tragedy. Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday propose tough legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, say nationalist passions benefit opponents of his reforms. The soviet leader tell a meeting of the Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations be worsen in some regions of the country, due in part to active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups. Perestroika, or restructuring, be Gorbachev's program for widespread economic and social change. State-run media also indicate Friday that a crackdown have begin on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. The six-month conflict between the two republics over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh district have lead to mass rallies, strikes and ethnic violence since February. The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, intervene July 18. It reject any change in nagorno-karabakh's status but call for measures to develop the region's economy and culture. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh be one of the most rancorous domestic disputes face by Gorbachev since he become Communist Party chief in March 1985. He indicate Friday he want to defuse tensions between ethnic groups, but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis. Gorbachev speak before a plenary meeting of the Central Committee, the party's policy-making body. A summary of his remarks be distribute by the official Tass news agency. Gorbachev outline the reasons for a current aggravation of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union, Tass said. Among the causes, Gorbachev list a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups, inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups. Tass say that after Gorbachev note that nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces, he suggest increase accountability in soviet laws for kindle ethnic strife. Tass do not give details of Gorbachev's suggestion. At the July 18 Presidium meeting, the soviet leader accuse corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hide behind the Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive. Gorbachev say the grounds for tough legislation come directly from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which say the law can punish any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt. Tass say Gorbachev make other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, include an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on equal use of the more than 100 languages speak in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions. In particular, the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, forcibly incorporate into the Soviet Union in 1940, have demand more say in their own economic and government affairs. The labor newspaper Trud say 44 people in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, will face criminal charges follow an incident in which activists seek the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh attach slogans to their cars and drive around the city. The paper do not give the date or size of the mobile demonstration, but say 155 drivers have have their licenses revoke and 310 be fined. In its July 18th decision, the Presidium also order local law enforcement agencies to ensure order be restore in the Caucasus Mountain region. Tass report Friday that the situation be stabilize in Armenia, but say that at the urging of instigators, some strikes and protests be continuing. The international community be start to look beyond the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and be become increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former soviet Union. The problem be indeed a pressing one. The disputes in the Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union be cause great suffering for those involved. They be a source of legitimate concern to the Russians, who be worry by clashes close to their borders. They be concern too about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those countries where there be conflicts, and about the economic and social consequences of refugees flee to Russia (whose potential number be estimate at more than 2m). They believe that the problems in some of the former soviet republics be either ignore or misunderstood. The Russians fear that if they do nothing, the conflicts will worsen and probably spread. They argue that they have a legitimate concern in try to resolve conflicts that threaten their security. They ask why, when the international community be engage in peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the world's trouble spots, similar efforts should not be undertake in the hot spots near them. Equally, these disputes be of legitimate concern to Britain, its western partners and the whole international community, both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoke regional instability. If uncontrolled, they pose a variety of threats to european security, include increase traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism. Crises in Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations with the west: unless they be carefully handled, they risk prejudice the emerge relationship between us. The west be sometimes suspicious of Moscow's attitude. There be no differences about the need to resolve these conflicts: but there be differences over how to go about it. The british government will not underwrite russian involvement unless it be sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn into occupy forces. Nor be countries that secure their independence when the Soviet Union be dissolve keen that the west should concede to Moscow the same role it play in the soviet empire. They fear that this would compromise their sovereignty. When they be willing for russian troops to play a peacekeeping role, they want there to be some form of international monitoring. This have mean that, even though the west lack the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots, it have be wary of appear to endorse russian involvement instead, in case it have imperial tendencies. If we be to fashion a joint approach by Russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former soviet Union, we must address all these concerns. clearly Russia have an important role to play in this area. If the Russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community, the west in turn needs guarantees that Russia will not regard recognition of its involvement as give it carte blanche in the former soviet Union. peace-keeping in the former soviet Union, as indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply with internationally recognise principles. It need to be look at on a case by case basis. Respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount. We agree that the principles underlie Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operations would need to include: strict respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved; an invitation from the government concern and the consent of the parties to the conflict; commitment to a parallel political peace process; a clear mandate set out the role of the peacekeeping forces (which should whenever possible be multinational in character); and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed. These principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the parties to the conflict, focus attention and, where possible, resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former soviet Union. All this will help enhance russian peacekeeping practices. Although the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the UN lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves, they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process. Extending co-operation within the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and also co-operation between Russia and Nato, might help improve training for russian peacekeepers. This be an area we shall need to explore further. We also need to put much more emphasis on preventive diplomacy. One of the ways in which we can help prevent conflicts be to strengthen the democratic institutions in the newly independent countries of the former soviet Union. The CSCE and other international institutions can play an important role here, draw the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on ways of promote democratic values and principles. We discuss ways of strengthen the CSCE's role, include the role of the High Commissioner for National Minorities, at the recent Rome ministerial meeting. We must try to find ways of managing and resolve tensions before they erupt into conflict. It will not be easy, but we must try. Potentially explosive cocktails of ethnic and political animosities could spread the fire of intolerance all too easily to other countries and regions. We need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership. And we need to deal with it urgently. Our security be indivisible and we must ensure it by vigorous and imaginative efforts aim at promote peace for all as well as rights for all. The authors be UK foreign secretary and russian foreign minister RUSSIA fly 3,000 special forces to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled Caucasus mountains at the weekend, its second troop deployment in a week to support a beleaguered government in its former empire. Russian President Boris Yeltsin send Spetsnaz commando and elite police to Vladikavkaz, capital of the Russian autonomous republic of North Ossetia, 1,100 miles south of Moscow. The troops be send to halt fight between Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who officials claim be set fire to ossetian-owned homes. Scores be report kill and injure in street fight between Ossetians and Ingush in the past several days. Ingush rebels be report yesterday to have take hostage 80 russian interior ministry soldiers base in the region. A local official say the soldiers be seize on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, locate near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populate mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said. The Ingush, who declare an independent state in June, be demand the return of lands that russian leader Josef Stalin expropriate in 1944 and declare part of North Ossetia. Mr Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar hold emergency meetings on the crisis on Saturday and yesterday. At the same time, the North ossetian government say it would distribute russian army-supplied automatic weapons to civilian volunteers. 'The russian authorities be strong enough to make all those violate the law respect it,' russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's specialist on the Caucasus, tell russian television. The russian action mirror recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where russian troops have also be deployed. The Central Asian nation, which have yet to form its own army since the Soviet Union collapse last December, have also distribute weapons to civilians. On October 26-27 russian soldiers play a crucial role in crush a coup attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. The Caucasus mountains, which stretch from southern Russia to the borders of Turkey and Iran, be engulf by several conflicts. Among them be Georgia's war with abkhazian separatists, and Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. Moldavia, act to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agree Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making moldavian the republic's official language. The republic's parliament act in response to a decree issue on Dec. 22 by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the official news agency Tass reported. Gorbachev also give the republic 10 days to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measures guarantee equal rights for all ethnic groups within its borders. Tass say the Moldavan parliament agree to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that Gorbachev say restrict the rights of minorities. Ethnic tension have grip Moldavia, a largely agricultural republic border Romania, during its push for independence from the Soviet Union this year. The unrest turn violent last month, when government troops clash with activists, leave four dead. Gorbachev say the conflicts have reach critical levels, and he put part of the blame on the moldavian Supreme Soviet for enact laws that discriminate against minorities. alarm by rise moldavian nationalism, two of the republic's minority groups have begin their own separatist movements. The Gagauz, a group of about 150,000 turkish Christians, declare a new republic in southern Moldavia. In the eastern part of Moldavia, more than 300,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have join in declare a new republic along the Dneister River. All three groups claim discrimination by Moldavians. In particular, they resent a new law making Moldavian the official language and require people in dozens of jobs range from doctors to hairdressers to pass moldavian language tests by 1995. Tass do not say how the moldavian parliament would modify the law. Moldavian be identical to romanian except for the Cyrillic script Josef Stalin impose on the republic. It be speak by two-thirds of the republic's residents. soviet hard-liners want Gorbachev to impose a state of emergency and presidential rule in trouble zones throughout the ethnically and geographically diverse country. Gorbachev say the declaration of the Gagauz and Dniester republics be illegal under the Soviet and moldavian constitutions, as be elections to form legislatures and any actions by those bodies. The moldavian legislature have also vote to declare the elections null and void. After residents of the Gagauz region begin hold local elections in late October, the moldavian legislature clamp a two-month state of emergency on the region, restrict movement in and out of the area and ban public rallies. Volunteer brigades of college-age Moldavians, who then flock to the region to try to stop the separatist movement, be order dissolve by Gorbachev's decree. The volunteers be organize by nationalist groups, include the moldavian People's Front. A CEASEFIRE in Moldova be threaten yesterday when a truck driver transport militiamen be shoot dead by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority. The shooting come shortly after the ceasefire come into effect between the Moldovan authorities, dominate by ethnic Romanians, and the minority base in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr. At least nine people have be kill in clashes over the past week. As in the more severe conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the underlying tensions be grow and neither side believe it be losing. In other respects, however, the conflicts be quite different and illustrate the complexity of conflict with which the former Soviet Union be now faced. The Trans Dnestr conflict stem directly from the breakup of the Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh have be a source of tension between Azeris and Armenians for centuries. Moldova (formerly Moldavia) be finally take under full soviet control in 1944. The soviet leadership seek to stifle any attempts to preserve its former links with Romania - call Moldovan a separate language from Romanian, and construct a separate history for the Moldovan people. Industry be largely situate on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staff by Russians and Ukrainians. Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 per cent of the population, with Moldovans account for 64 per cent. The little republic (4.5m people) be slow to respond to the stirrings of reform. When it did, in 1989, a language movement quickly put the hardline Communist Party on the defensive and it lose power in 1990 to the present nationalist government, head by President Mircea Snegur, the former secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee. From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it be clear that the russian and, to a less extent, the ukrainian minorities would be hostile, react to laws establish Moldovan as the official language and to calls for renew union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaim Trans Dnestr independent under a russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov. During the August coup last year, the Moldovan government stoutly reject it and the Trans Dnestr authorities welcome it, siding with the soviet army in its brief efforts to impose military rule. Thereafter, the two sides have gather military forces. The Trans Dnestr side have be augment by Cossacks from nearby areas return to their traditional role as defenders of Russia's borders. The daily Izvestia report yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appoint themselves mercenaries for the Russians (they be pay from Rbs2,000 to rbs5,000 a week by the Trans Dnestr authorities). TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union be order to pull out from the armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they be fire on during clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States' defence minister, announce the decision as fight worsen in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce. The enclave be administer by Azerbaijan but largely populate by Armenians. The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorise regiment follow the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers catch in the fighting between armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces. fight flare again yesterday in the capital Stepanakert, where the regiment be based. Azerbaijani and armenian officials claim their civilian targets be under particularly vicious attack. Marshal Shaposhnikov, who be also commander-in-chief, have long warn that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union. No dates have be give for the withdrawal. Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn. Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which encompass Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have be order to rebuff attacks on military installations. Azeri and armenian officials say sophisticated weapons, include combat helicopters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers, be be use by guerrillas on both sides in the four-year-old conflict. armenian militants attack the last Azeri stronghold in Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday, accord to Azerbaijan's interior ministry, which say residents of the town of Shusha flee as helicopter gunships swoop down from snow-covered mountains. Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan will not give up any territory. Ethnic violence kill 148 people and wound 885 this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official news agency Tass say Wednesday. Tass say 748 of the injured have to be hospitalize and say a search be continue for a police officer who vanish June 7. No new outbreaks be report in the region near the border city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clashes arise from a land dispute begin on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems. The argument involve allocation of land in a densly populated region where housing be scarce. It be the late in a series of bloody civil conflicts to trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government. Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministry's Political Department, say that in two years of civil strife mainly ethnic clashes in the soviet Union, about 24,000 people have be arrested. He say in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troops have to be use in 13 regions of the Soviet Union because of such outbreaks, Tass said. Grienko say 16 ministry soldiers be killed, four be report miss and more than 1,000 wounded. Tass do not quote Grienko on how civilians casualties. The general be quote as say these conflicts be often accompany by riots and pogroms, arson and massacre of innocent people, (and) complete or partial destabilization of the situation. Besides unrest this month in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence also have be report in recent years in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan. The government have decide to give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who be expel from their homelands by Josef Stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years, Tass report Wednesday. The ice have be broken. A start have be made. We're work on create such autonomy, say Rafik Nishanov, chairman of a chamber of the Soviet legislature, in remarks carry by the official news agency. However, he said, the nuts and bolts of how to create the regions still have to be work out. For example, a 10-year program on resettlement. People can't just be expel from the area for others to move in. The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who live on the Volga River be forcibly resettle during World War II, when Josef Stalin kick peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trust to occupy strategic areas. The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have be agitate to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands, and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declare that all peoples exile under Stalin should be consider politically rehabilitated. But other people now occupy the lands and houses that belong to the exiles, and re-establishing their dominion in their home regions will not be so simple. The Supreme Soviet take the basic decision that the two autonmous regions should be create on Nov. 28 but keep it quiet, apparently fear explosive reactions from the populations now live in the regions. It be also a potentially dangerous precedent: The Soviet Union be a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic groups, and many of them have outstanding territorial claims. Trouble already have be report between ethnic Germans and Russians in several cities on the Volga. Residents of the Saratov and Volgograd regions have protest the prospect of see many of the nation's estimate 2 million Germans descend on them. Ethnographers estimate there be some 500,000 crimean Tatars in the soviet Union, and another 1 million in Turkey. Their protests near the Kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allow to return to their homeland be among the first tests of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promises of great democracy. Several thousand Tatars have be filter back to the Crimea each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return. A wave of some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrate to West Germany this year, but many would probably stay if they could be assure of their own republic, say Irina Ostroukh, a researcher at the Soviet Institute of Ethnography who studies ethnic Germans. The Nov. 28 plan approve by the Supreme Soviet recommend exclude from the german region areas where resistance to german resettlement be strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts. The explosive conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the nagorno-karabakh region have lead to 200 deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last two years. Both sides claim control over the mountainous enclave. The Supreme Soviet charge the government with create a commmission to determine how to create the regions for the Germans and Crimean Tatars. RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deploy 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow. Reports from the remote transcaucasian region say hundreds of heavily arm russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion move into a 7km-wide security zone separate rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia. Georgian national guards occupy similar positions on their side of the border and pull out all their men from the South ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. But Itar-Tass news agency say gunfire overnight near the city kill four civilians and injured two others, underscore the difficulties face the operation. The mission be the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former soviet Union, whose disintegration last year have prompt waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the romanian to the Afghan borders. Reports from the former Soviet republic of Moldova say several people have be kill overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government forces and separatists. In the Transcaucasian republic of Armenia, Radio Russia say five civilians have die overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the late victims of a four-year undeclared war which have kill 2,000 people. Russia and Georgia be cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where arm conflict could be resolve with the help of 'political measures and actions'. South Ossetia be part of Georgia but want to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia, which be assign to russia by Stalin. Hundreds have be kill since 1990 in fight between Georgians and Ossetians. The peace-keepers have be issue with un-style light-blue helmet bands and match chevrons on their sleeves. They will be join later by a multi-ethnic force - Russians, Ukrainians, Ossetians and other mountain peoples - under the nominal command of North Ossetian leaders. The peace-keepers' mission be to form a physical barrier between the two sides, open the way to future talks. The great threat be expect to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either russian or georgian authorities. Interfax news agency say Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, at present on a visit to Moldova, propose a similar peace-keeping operation there.

Guangzhou, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The high flood peaks on the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers have passed, say Zhu Senlin, governor of south China's Guangdong Province. While inspect flood control and relief work in Qingyuan city on the Beijiang River yesterday, he attribute Guangdong's success in combat this flood -- almost the big in 100 years -- to concert efforts by the armymen station in Guangdong and local residents. more than 200 people lose their lives in the natural disaster, which destroy 189,000 rooms and ruin crops on 1.2 million hectares. The flood be cause by successive torrential rainstorms in the Xijiang and Beijiang River valleys in early and middle June. Major flood monitoring stations on the two rivers record their high water levels, all four meters above the danger mark. local governments at various levels in the province have pay close attention to flood control work, and leading government and communist party officials of different localities have go to the flood-fighting front. No breaches of major embankments or reservoirs be report despite the most serious flood in a hundred years, effectively protect the safety of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, and the Pearl (Zhujiang) River Delta. But the losses cause by the flood be quite serious, say the governor. accord to him, 11 million people in the province's nine cities and 55 counties be affected, and more than 200 people die in the natural disaster, with 189,000 rooms destroy and 1.2 million hectares of crops ruined. The direct economic losses be set at 10.2 billion yuan. The governor warn that though the flood danger have receded, the determination to fight possible further floods could not slacken, as this be just the beginning: the main flood season, which usually begin in late July and early August, have not yet arrived. He urge local officials to be on constant alert against further possible floods and be meticulous about flood prevention and control measures, while do their utmost to help flood victims, assist them to resume production as soon as possible and maintain social stability. Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Floods have all recede along Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang except at a section of the Xijiang River in Wuzhou city, Guangxi, a spokesman from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters announce today. The spokesman attribute the fall water level to the major water conservancy projects which help to mitigate losses. Meanwhile, he said, tension have be ease in the Pearl River delta as the late tropical storm have be weaken after land in Yangjiang city, Guangdong Province. Floods hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujiang and Zhejiang provinces follow the first heavy rains and floods which typically hit China from the south to the north from June to August. Earlier reports say that successive torrential rainstorms in the Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys in early and mid-june result in a big flood, one of the most serious in 100 years, in Guangdong Province and cause heavy losses. Major flood monitoring stations on the two rivers record their high water levels, all four meters above the warning level. In an urgent conference late yesterday, the Guangdong provincial government urge localities to help flood victims with food, shelter, clothing and medical care so that no one would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in the flooded areas. The province have allocate 300 million kg of grain and 110 million yuan in cash along with over 10 million tons of such farm production supplies as chemical fertilizer and diesel oil to the flood-stricken areas. Meanwhile, 740 million yuan in loans and another 50 million yuan in donations have also be send to flood areas in Guangdong Province. While inspect flood control and relief work in Jiangxi Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, say the flooded areas should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts and with support from various departments. While inspect Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi, and Fengcheng, Xingang, Jian and Taihe, on June 24-26, Wen say the key to mitigate economic losses be to resume production as soon as possible. The localities should waste no time in implement various measures to resume production and rehabilitate their homeland, he said. As one of China's major bread baskets, Jiangxi be of key importance to China in agricultural production, Wen said. It have a direct bearing on the grain supply in south China. He urge the local governments to farmers resume agricultural production. The following be a recorded report file by this station's reporter on the front lines of the province's battle against the flooding yesterday. [begin recording] Dear audience, it be now almost noon on 20 June. I'm reporting in Changshanyuan at the eastern gate of Changsha City. This morning, Provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Maolin, provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu, and some other provincial party and government leaders arrive here in Changshayuan, on the front line of the province's flood resistance effort, to direct the fight against the flooding. Governor Chen Bangzhu and vice Governor Zheng Peimin just arrive back in Changsha at about 0700 this morning after attend a Beijing meeting. as soon as they step out from the train, they set out for Changshayuan, the front line of the province's flood resistance. I interview Governor Chen Bangzhu here on the spot. [Reporter] How be you, Governor Chen? You have inspect some flood-stricken areas in Changsha City this morning. Will you please tell our audience something about the province's flood situation? [governor] This year, Hunan have be hit by a flood of a severity unseen for the past 100 years in terms of both water level and quantity. Over the past few days, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province have be bravely fight the flood and have be make concerted efforts to provide disaster relief to afflict areas, with the result that some of the province's key dams have remain sound and economic losses have be reduce to a minimum. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm regards and thanks to the broad masses of Army personnel and people fight in the front lines of the province's battle against the flood. At the moment, the province's flood situation remain very serious, because the water level be still high. accord to weather forecasts and meteorological reports, the province be expect more rain to fall over the next few days. We will definitely encounter more hardships and difficulties. Under the current circumstances, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province should far step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention and disaster relief work, this be an override task at the moment. We be full of confidence that, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the broad masses of the Hunan Army personnel and people will be able to overcome the difficulties and hardships cause by natural calamities such as flooding, waterlogging, and so on and will win a complete victory in the on-going flood prevention and disaster relief struggle. [end recording] Beijing, 21 Jun (xinhua) -- accord to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the large or the second large flood peaks since the liberation of China occur a few days ago in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers be drop slowly; however, high water levels will remain in these rivers for the next few days. Due to interaction of the Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang, the Zhujiang Delta will face a high water-level test. Heavy rainfall over a wide area since mid-june result in the large flood waters since liberation of the country in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, and Xiang Jiang rivers. The flood water in Guangdong's Xi Jiang crest in Gaoyao County on 20 June; the water level in Gaoyao's Xi Jiang drop to 13.37 meters at 0600 today. A flood peak occur in Bei Jiang in Guangdong's Sanshui at 0400 on 20 June, raise the water level to 10.39 meters -- the large flood level ever recorded. The water level droppped to 10.16 meters at 0600 today. Drops in water levels in Guangdong's Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang do not mean that Guangdong's flood situations have eased, because flood waters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea after the two flood waters jointly flow through the low-lying Zhujiang Delta. In particular, the sea tide may add to the flood waters on 25 June. With these factors combined, the Zhujiang Delta, which have a developed economy and a forest of factories, will face the most rigorous flood water test since the liberation of the country. The situation in the Xiang Jiang be also not an easy one. The flood peak pass Changsha on 19 June, but the water level at the Changsha Station be still at 25 meters at 0200 today [1800 GMT 20 June]. Because the water level have remain high for a long period, several dangerous situations have occur along the river's dikes. Dike reinforce work needs to be step up. The flood peak in Gan Jiang enter Boyang Lake on 20 June. However, due to continued rains over the last few days, the water level in the upper reach west of Ganzhou have begin to rise again. At 0800 today, the water level at the Ganzhou Station be 100.95 meters, 3.45 meters above the warning level.

18,d107g,"public interest in the Earth's trouble climate may be wash away with the heavy rains that be need to end the current U.S. drought, weather experts warn during a drought symposium here. Society tend to flit from hysteria to hysteria, say Pat Michaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the symposium. He say the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places, have draw much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers. I'm worry ... that when the next drought happens, we be go to have to rediscover the climate problem, say Michaels, president of the Association of State Climatologists. Experts say Thursday that the greenhouse effect the warming of the Earth's atmosphere have bring need attention to changes in the global climate, even though it be not directly relate to the drought. Many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposium agree that the Earth's temperature be warming, but they debate whether it be a short- or long-term phenomenon and its impact on Earth. However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program in Washington, D.C., say the uncertainty mean policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertaking policies that make sense in their own right. Mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuels, he said, by become more energy efficient, replant forests and investigate alternative energy supplies. Scientists have warn in recent years that Earth's atmosphere be gain in carbon dioxide and other gases, which trap heat and cause the overall temperature to rise. Besides fossil fuels, the depletion of forests in South America have be blame for the increase of carbon dioxide and methane. Some have warn that high temperature will change the character of many countries, for example dry out the U.S. Midwest or melt polar ice caps. The symposium be sponsor by The Weather Channel, an atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live. Earlier Thursday, the climatologists be tell the movement of planets and the moon and sunspots may help lead to drought in the Southeast. There be some evidence that as Jupiter go around the sun at its fast point, there be drought conditions in the Southeast in the months of April and October, Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer said. However, David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington, say he be skeptical of Plummer's thesis. There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase, Rodenhuis said. The next business of the scientist be to ... extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect. The crippling drought hit North America be expect to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization report today. The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last year's level, which be already below the expect production. If the drought in the United States end now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decrease output, the agency reported. As a result, world grain stocks be project to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said. If crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further. Such a development would have serious implications for the food security, particularly of many low-income, food-deficit countries, the report said. The high grain prices result from a low supply would hit poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned. It say the rise prices could also reduce food aid from develop countries. The most severely hit crops be coarse grains mostly maize, barley and oats, the report said. The agency project good harvests in other parts of the world. In Asia the yearly monsoon rains start on time, and production in Europe and the Soviet be expect to be large than last year. Grain production in South America should be slightly lower this year than last. In the Sahel region of sub-saharan Africa, however, locusts flourish in unexpectedly heavy rains have damage this year's harvest. Potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million tons, FAO said. Weather experts discuss the drought Thursday and its possible causes and effects, and say they hop to produce a consensus on how much long it will last. All of the speakers at the 1988 Drought Symposium call for more research and study. There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase. The next business of the scientist be to eliminate the possibilities of ... and extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect, say David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington. The symposium attend by 13 state and national experts be sponsor by The Weather Channel, an atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live. John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., say the drought in the Southeast might be lessen or end in the next few months by a heavy than normal hurricane season. Hope say current weather conditions point to more tropical storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane season. He stress that a hurricane's effect on drought be variable, depend on the intensity and speed of the storm. Nevertheless, he said, some Southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their rainfall in some months from hurricanes. Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer tell the symposium he think the position of the planet Jupiter have something to do with drought in the Southeast. However, Rodenhuis say he be skeptical about Plummer's thesis. It's very necessary to be cautious and analytical about the issue, he said. heavy rain deluge some drought-hit areas as Congress begin work on a package of relief for America's farmers, and farmers in Kentucky today greet the arrival of the first shipment of hay airlift free from Oregon. Everything look so good with a bit of rain over the past 24 hours, farmer Herman Krone say Tuesday at his 2,800-acre farm in southern Illinois, which President Reagan plan to visit Thursday during a tour of the drought-stricken area. However, Krone said, almost one-third of his 1,200 acres of corn already have be lost. Marth Wilkinson, wife of Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and business manager of the family's farm, be at Louisville's Standiford Field today for the arrival of the first hay shipment from Portland, Ore. United Parcel Service plan to ship free of charge 20 to 30 tons of hay from Portland to Louisville each day for the next two weeks. The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, issue a report predict severe damage to the harvest from the drought. It estimated, for example, that corn output this year would shrivel to 5.2 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion last year. The dry weather be the large drought that our nation have ever experienced, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng tell legislators. I think history will show that it's truly more mammoth than any of us have ever experienced. extremely heavy rain fell Tuesday in sections of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. In Texas, more than 6{ inches fell in 75 minutes in Mesquite, wash a pickup truck and several cars into a creek and leave some homes 8 inches deep in water. Water be up to the tops of cars in Garland and street flooding be report in Heath. nearly 6 inches fell in DeQueen, Ark. Showers and thunderstorms be widespread over the Middle Atlantic States, the Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast states. Thunderstorms boom today over the Dakotas and Minnesota. In Washington, the House and Senate Agriculture committees begin work on wide-ranging legislation that would provide payments of up to $100,000 each to farmers whose crops have be wipe out by the dry spell. House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, call for final action on the measure by mid-august. The drought have dry up pastures, force livestock farmers to go far afield for hay. The hay that arrive in Kentuky today will be store at a fairgrounds, and distribute next week by lottery to farmers, who will pay for the hay, officials said. It seem like everyone in the state want this hay, state Department of Agriculture spokesman Roger Nesbitt say Tuesday. The delay have anger some farmers, such as Bernetta Smith, who expect to run out of hay for her 147 beef cows in one to two days. I don't see any sense in store it because people need this hay. I don't understand it, she said. At least 50 truckloads of hay gather from the Carolinas and Virginia be be ship to Ohio on Thursday in a drive organize by the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. Despite the recent rain, communities with dried-up water supplies continue to restrict water use. Until the drought ends, the 650 residents of Vintondale, Pa., about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, will have to do without run water from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. every day, Mayor Michael Palovich say Tuesday. Palovich say he be try to arrange for an emergency supply to be truck in. The drought have have a silver lining for anglers in the Reno, Nevada, area. The state Board of Wildlife Commissioners remove the limit on catches at Rye Patch and Lahontan reservoirs because the reservoirs be expect to be dry by the end of summer, leave fish high and dry. here be a state-by-state summary of drought developments Wednesday: Weather forecasters today be offer drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months. A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought say many areas now experience extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recover from the drought within 3 months. The disappointing forecast come as President Reagan head to the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms. On Tuesday the Agriculture Department report sharp declines in the outlook for several crops. That be follow Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the National Weather Service say that drought-stricken areas from the Dakotas east to New York and from the canadian border to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee be likely to continue to be short of rain. That area, which include the major grain-growing states where crops already be suffering, be give a 55 percent chance of less than normal rainfall. And some states in the center of the area, stretch from West Virginia to Nebraska and from Wisconsin to Missouri, may be even drier. They be give a 60 percent chance of be short of precipitation. A slice of southern California, include Los Angeles, be the dry area in the forecast, with a 70 percent chance of have below normal rainfall. The rest of coastal California also will be dry, the forecast said. The outlook also say there's a 55 percent chance of hot than normal temperatures through the U.S. heartland from New England to Idaho and from the canadian border to Oklahoma. Within that area, the chances of high temperatures be above 65 percent in Wyoming, while central Midwestern states have a 60 percent chance of above average temperatures. Wetter than normal weather be predict for west and south Texas, and parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Normal precipitation be forecast for the Atlantic and Gulf coast states, along with the Northwest and northern Mountain States. The Weather Service say normal temperatures be expect for the Atlantic states from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast states. West Texas and New Mexico may be cool than normal, but the far West be expect to see its normal quota of summer heat. The separate drought impact assessment, issue by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, point out that predict an end to the drought be a complex thing, since dry spells have no normal lifetime. The low 4 percent probability of an end within 3 months be base simply on a statistical analysis of past droughts, the agency said. The report note that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the continental United States be experience severe or extreme drought, with parts of 35 states affected. That put the current drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934. Kentucky's governor have criticize the federal government for be too slow in deal with the drought, and Iowa's governor warn that farmers in his state still face potential disaster despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend. Crews begin instal pumps on barges Monday to haul fresh water to southern Louisiana towns plague by rise salt levels in the low Mississippi River. Meanwhile, House Speaker Jim Wright say in Washington he hop that a relief package with disaster payments of up to $100,000 for drought-stricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready for floor action in Congress this week. here be a state-by-state summary of the late drought developments: The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng say Monday. But the United States will continue to be a major player in world agriculture and in 1989 should be able to bounce back from this year's drought losses, he said. Lyng's remarks be prepare for delivery at a meeting of farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors. A large portion of the United States suffer from some degree of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records begin in 1895, he said. Moreover, on July 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous United States be in the severe to extreme drought category, he said. In 1934, more than 60 percent be so rated, and in August 1954 more than 50 percent be in that category. Because of the large early season area now experience drought in the U.S., 1988 appear to have the potential to approach or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s, Lyng said. even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock fee grains so that the United States will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand, he said. Lyng say total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less than previously estimate because prices be much higher. But it be important to note that we will have no shortages, that we will still be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas buyers, he said.

Kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, have 1.9 million residents 60 percent foreigners and an army of 20,300 soldiers. CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accuse Kuwait of steal oil from its territory and force down oil prices through overproduction. Kuwait and U.N. diplomats dismiss Iraq's claim that it invade at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries. REACTION: The U.N. Security Council vote 14-0 to condemn the invasion. President Bush denounce it as naked agression. He freeze Iraq's assets in the United States and block almost all Iraqi imports, include oil. The order also froze Kuwait property under U.S. jurisdiction a move intend to keep Iraq from seize it. The Soviets also condemn the invasion and stop arms sales to Iraq. Kuwait's U.S. ambassador say the nation have ask for american military intervention. A Pentagon source say a U.S. naval group be divert toward the persian Gulf. oil prices soar in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion would reduce the supply of oil. Administration and congressional officials agree that the CIA do its job. Since last week, President Bush have be warn by intelligence analysts that what originally look like a military bluff be quickly turn into the kind of troop deployment that could be use to invade Kuwait or even Saudi Arabia. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster even hand-delivered certain fresh details on the Iraqi buildup to National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Among the assessments he convey be a conclusion that, by this week, President Saddam Hussein's force would be capable of penetrate Kuwait or Saudi Arabia. The agency lack hard evidence of an intent to invade, intelligence officials say. But as the buildup grew, the CIA become more alarmed, partly because Mr. Hussein be so unpredictable, and partly because, unlike many other arab leaders, he have be know to carry out his threats. Saudi Arabia have be subdue in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which place Iraqi forces near the oil-rich kingdom's border. Oil executives say Saudi Arabia have not and will not take the most potent action possible against Iraq close the pipeline that carry Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea. The executives say the Saudis believe this would give Iraq's belligerent president, Saddam Hussein, an excuse to attack and occupy Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, give Iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world. The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion be make by an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press Agency the day after the Iraqi move. The statement say Saudi Arabia be follow the Kuwait situation with extreme concern and that King Fahd would be seek to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensure the interests of all. The statement do not condemn the invasion. The only tangible help Saudi Arabia give the Kuwaiti government in the wake of the invasion be to shelter members of the ruling family, include the emir, Sheik Jaber al-ahmed al-sabah, and the crown prince. Both nations be tightly run by royal families and have be close allies. The Saudis also allow the Kuwaiti royal family to briefly operate a radio, reportedly from a mobile van, in the area around the Saudi-Kuwait border. But Friday the radio go off the air after a desperate call: The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help. It be not know if the radio have be discover by the Iraqis or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoke Saddam at a time when fears be be express that he might invade Saudi Arabia as well. Saudi Arabia borders Kuwait and Iraq's invasion forces be reportedly near the Saudi border. The Saudis do condemn the invasion as part of a joint statement issue by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it be ally with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. The six states issue a statement saying, We strongly condemn and be very sorry for this attack that one Arab state take against another arab state. ... We do not recognize anything result from it. Iraq's 1-million-member arm forces be clearly too much for the joint 3,000-member Gulf Cooperation Council force or Saudi Arabia's 65,700-member army. Saudi Arabia be also one of the 14 members of the 21-member Arab League that condemn the invasion in the same terms as the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Arab League, with one-third of its members vote against the resolution or abstaining, be clearly unable to take any direct action. Turkey have also refuse to take action and have not comment about President Bush's suggestion that it cut off Iraq's oil pipeline to the Mediterranean. Two parallel pipelines pump Iraqi crude oil to a terminal at Yumurtalik at the eastern corner of Turkey's Mediterranean coast and constitute Iraq's major oil export outlet. Ruling party members say today that the government, fear a U.S. air attack, be distribute automatic weapons to tens of thousands of supporters and prepare to evacuate the Iraqi capital. A boycott of Iraqi oil force Baghdad today to close one of two pipelines in Turkey that be pump the bulk of Iraq's export oil, turkish officials said. A british official say Iraqi troops round up american and british visitors in Kuwait and take them to iraq. The Foreign Office spokesman say most be passengers from a british Airways flight strand in Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion Thursday. There be no evidence that they be in any way in trouble, the official said. Saudi Arabia be report reinforce its troops along the Kuwaiti border follow concerns Iraq may try to invade it. Pentagon sources say the USS Independence and its carrier battle group be now on station in the Arabian Sea, a position that would allow it to launch fighter planes into the Persian Gulf region. gulf-based diplomats say soldiers from the american rapid deployment force, form to react to crises in the Middle East, have be dispatch to the area. In other developments: The new Kuwait government instal by Iraq hint it might take hostages or seize property of nations that take punitive measures against Iraq. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein say the 100,000 soldiers who invade Kuwait begin to pull back Sunday. President Bush say Iraq be lying. Oil prices jump more than $3 a barrel on news Europe and Japan be join the embargo of Iraqi oil. Stocks slump worldwide. Hospital officials say at least 300 Kuwaiti and Iraqi soldiers be kill during the invasion. In London, Kuwaitis arrive on a special plane say 700 Kuwaitis died. The embargo of Iraqi oil grow over the weekend to include Japan and the European Community. Along with the United States, they buy more than half Iraq's export oil, with most of it pump through Turkey. An official of the state-run turkish pipeline company BOTAS say pumping stop at one of the two turkish pipelines at 5 p.m. Iraq reduce flow in the second, wider, pipeline to 70 percent of capacity, they said. There be no comment from Iraq. The two pipelines pump Iraqi crude from Kirkuk oil fields in northern Iraq to a terminal at the northeastern tip of the Mediterranean. They carry 70 million tons of crude annually, provide the outlet for the major share of Iraqi exports. The BOTAS official say all the countries participate in the embargo purchase their Iraqi crude from the turkish outlet. Iraq also exports oil through a Saudi Arabian pipeline and via tankers in the northern Persian Gulf. A Foreign Office spokesman say today as say a total of 366 people have be assemble by Iraqi troops in Kuwait, mostly passengers from a stranded british Airways flight. They be be transport by bus to the Iraqi border. Baghdad do not give any reason for its action. immediately after the invasion Thursday, 11 Americans be round up by Iraqi troops. They turn up safe in Baghdad. The new iraqi-installed foreign minister of Kuwait, Lt. Col. Walid Sa'oud Mohammed Abdullah, warn against further sanctions in a statement broadcast Sunday by Iraqi radio. Countries that resort to punitive measures against the provisional free Kuwait government and fraternal Iraq should remember that they have interests and nationals in Kuwait, he said. Iraqi soldiers invade Kuwait after complain that its violation of OPEC production quotas be drive down world crude prices, lower Iraqi oil revenues. Saddam also accuse Kuwait of steal oil from a field that include land both sides claim. The respect Middle East Economic Survey report today that Kuwait's oil export facilities have be shut down. It also say there be considerable doubt Saudi Arabia, with the world's large oil reserves, would be willing to make up the potential world oil shortage. Kuwait and Iraq together account for one-fifth of the 23.5 million barrels produce daily by the 13 OPEC nations. Tensions remain high in the region; a U.S. official say in Washington that Iraqi troops mass on the Kuwaiti-Saudi border be apparently dig in. An american technician at a secret Saudi Arabian base say the kingdom have send 200 to 300 tanks toward its border with Kuwait. Oil industry sources in Saudi Arabia reach by telephone from Bahrain say Saudi troops be enter the region of Khafji, near the border. Residents reach by telephone report intense air activity near the Saudi airport overnight. The Washington Post report today that Egypt be mobilize some elements of its armed forces to assist Saudi Arabia in the event of an invasion. U.S. officials say there be no indication Iraqi troops be prepare to invade Saudi Arabia. But Bush send Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to the kingdom to confer with its leaders, and the White House say Secretary of State James a. Baker would go this week to Turkey. Saadi Mehdi Saleh, the Iraqi army commander, be quote by the Al-Iraq newspaper as say tens of thousands of volunteers have join the army to defend what he call Iraq and the revolution in Kuwait. Americans, he be quote as saying, should understand that the people of the great leader Saddam Hussein cannot be frightened. local members of the rule Baath party say preparations be under way to evacuate all of Baghdad's 4 million people to camp outside the city. They be be tell that the U.S. Air Force might attack or that Israel might attack with chemical or nuclear weapons. The party members also say the party have distribute guns, mainly AK-47 automatic rifles, to tens of thousands of people around the country. State radio say Saddam have order the formation of 11 new Iraqi army divisions, expect to generate 100,000 troops. The arab world's most formidible military force be already estimate at 1 million men. At a border checkpoint 30 miles south of the Iraqi port city of Basra, dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carry hundreds of soldiers cross back into Iraq on Sunday. But thousands of Iraqi soldiers remain behind in Kuwait, control major government buildings, commerical centers and ports. Diplomats in the region say a new Kuwaiti army fan out through Kuwait. The force comprise about 80,000 troops, mostly iraqis. The nine-member Kuwaiti military government, announce by Iraq on Saturday, remain a mystery. No photograph of the name leaders have be show and 12 reporters bring to Kuwait by the Ministry of Information could not locate any of them. Kuwaiti diplomats say they be all Iraqis, include a son-in-law of Saddam, a charge official Iraqi media denied. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seem determine to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethrone the government of neighbor Kuwait. The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflect the brutality Saddam have use to crush all opposition at home since come to power in 1979. The sentence for criticize Saddam be death, and the president consider Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to Iraq. Iraqis will not forget the say that cut necks be good than cut means of living. Oh God Almighty, be witness that we have warn them, he say last month after prices tumble below $14 per barrel. He accuse Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of cost Iraq $14 billion in lose oil revenue by ignore their quotas assign by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He also accuse Kuwait of steal $2.4 billion by pump oil from a disputed field that straddle their border, and demand that Kuwait write off an estimate $15 billion it loan Iraq during the Persian Gulf war. Saddam be report to be incense that Kuwait be demand repayment for the wartime loans. Saddam say he fight the war to protect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution foment by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly Shiite Moslem Iran. Never mind that Iraq start the war in 1980 by invade Iran after a series of border skirmishes along the shatt-al-arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf. Despite claims that the war be an unprecedented victory, the long conflict stall Iraq's development, drag on for eight years. It have still not formally ended. The war bills keep the government from deliver material benefits promise to the Iraqi people directly after the war. The 1990 budget slash funds for imports and Iraqis be tell to brace for another year of austerity. Private investment have fail to take hold. Iraq end the war an estimate $70 billion in debt. Its main gulf port of Basra be still block and its oil infrastructure damaged. Tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war languish in iranian prisons and an estimate 500,000 Iraqis be kill or wounded. Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's 100 billion barrels. By control Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstanding wish for more gulf coastline. Iraq's 100,000 troops mass at the border in the past few weeks be believe part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulate to Iraq's demands. But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new OPEC quotas and Saddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he would not invade lull the arab world into the sense the crisis be over. Homage to the cause of Arab unity have be paramount in Middle East politics since postwar independence from colonial powers. Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s bring egyptian and Saudi Arabian intervention on oppose sides, no arab state have ever directly depose the government of a fellow Arab League member. Despite Iraqi claim that it be help internal opposition liberate Kuwait, it have long covet the tiny emirate. The Iraqi government refuse to recognize its independence in 1961 and threaten to attack then, but back down when Britain land troops in Kuwait. The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors along the Gulf. It prove the decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait be toothless. The GCC do not issue a statement, much less implement its mutual defense treaty. While Iraq be unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use the precedent of Kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues. bomb an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happen to Kuwait when it balk at Iraqi demands. also in a region entirely rule by absolute monarchs, the fall of one make the rest feel extremely vulnerable. In a series of bellicose statements in recent months, Saddam have seek to focus domestic attention outside Iraq. In March he threaten to burn half of Israel with Iraq's chemical weapons ban under international law if Iraq be attacked. It be a popular stance among Arabs frustrate with the lack of progress toward peace and a palestinian nation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. then Britain arrest several people on charges they be smuggle nuclear triggers into Baghdad. Weeks later, police in Europe impound what they say be parts to a supergun capable of fire chemical or nuclear shells into Israel. Saddam cry foul, claim the West be try to wreck the scientific progress of the Arabs. Saddam have seek to inherit the mantle of the late egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nassar as the leader of the Arab world. His relentless personality cult have dub him The Knight of the Arabs. For Kuwait on Thursday, he be a dark knight. ask the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador to Washington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah say at a news conference: Ambition. Hegemony. Control of the whole area. There be not any reason for it. Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators embrace warmly Tuesday as they begin talks on their oil and border dispute, sources said. Diplomats report that Iraq have mass 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border. gulf-based diplomatic sources say the Iraqi force, triple the number earlier reported, include about 300 soviet-made tanks, and dwarf the entire Kuwaiti army of 20,000 troops. The diplomats, who speak on condition of anonymity, say the troops have be concentrate along the border since last week, when Iraq begin threaten Kuwait. Iraq accuse the small Persian Gulf state of steal oil from a dispute border region and force oil prices to drop. The diplomats say the number of troops be at first difficult to determine. The delegation leaders, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-abdullah al-sabah of Kuwait, and Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, meet privately for two hours. There be no details on the negotiations, but sources say the meetings will continue Wednesday. Diplomatic sources have say they expect arab mediators to push the two sides to sign a treaty of non-belligerency to be follow by protracted negotiations on borders and compensation. The Iraq-Kuwait crisis break out on July 17 when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuse Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of drive down oil prices by exceed quotas set for them by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saddam say the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lose revenue. Saddam also demand compensation for the $2.4 billion in oil he claim Kuwait pump illegally from an oil field which straddle the unmarked border between the two countries. Iraq also demand that Kuwait forgive $15 billion in loans it extend to Baghdad during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's tough talk appear to have succeeded. Kuwait and the U.A.E agree to stick to their oil quotas at an OPEC meeting last week. OPEC member states also agree to a longstanding Iraqi demand to raise target crude oil prices from $18 to $21 a barrel. Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials agree to meet in Jiddah after intensive mediation efforts by king Fahd and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Kuwaiti leaders have insist that Iraq pull back its troops before conciliation talks could began, but later drop that demand. Kuwaiti officials also ask that Iraq agree to demarcate the disputed border between the nations, a move Iraq have refused. Iraq have historically lay claim to all of Kuwait and have long covet the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which command access to Iraq's sole outlet into the persian Gulf. The mediators have succeed in tone down a vitriolic campaign against Kuwait by the Iraqi state-run media. On Tuesday, the Iraqi delegation leave Baghdad without any public announcement. The lead al-thawra daily newspaper call the Jiddah meeting an opportunity ... for Kuwait ... to perceive Iraq's demands and respond to its rights. In contrast, the Kuwaiti delegation leave for Jiddah with fanfare and publicity. The Kuwaiti papers say they hop the Jiddah meeting be the start of a final just settlement of the differences between Iraq and Kuwait, in a manner ensure the legitimate rights of each.

Along with get seats for Sunday's game, the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel. The magazine be just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104,000 fans attend the Super Bowl. And the companies show few signs of cut back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claim as a business-entertainment expense. Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertain -- from an executive sit in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman hold a Super Bowl party in his living room and hop to write off the costs. One big change under the new law limit business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sport events like the Super Bowl: only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted. If a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 -- the go rate -- it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60. even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a ""substantial and bona fide business discussion"" before, during or after the game, say julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc. To take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture be no longer enough, Mr. Block says. And if a company want to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carry a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient. The tough IRS rule, however, hasn't slow ticket demand; even end-zone seats be fetch $500 each. ""even if it weren't tax deductible, it'd be worth it,"" say Tom Foley, chairman of Bibb Co., a Macon, Ga., maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the National Football League team logos. Bibb be fly about 20 people -- mostly customers -- to the game. ""We get more earnings from the trip than the expense,"" say Mr. Foley. Some companies say they be make adjustments or at least educate their executives about the new rules. A spokesman for Adolph Coors & Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, say its tax advisers instruct executives that ""this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business."" Air fare and lodging be still 100% deductible, as long as there be a planned business meeting in addition to the game. Meals be now 80% deductible as long as business be discussed. Under the old law, meals be fully deductible and all a company have to do be show a business relationship with the guest. Companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-super Bowl banquet, since the new tax law have a ""banquet meeting exception."" such meetings must have at least 40 persons, half of whom be away from home, and there must be a speaker. Executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the Super Bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor, say William J. Lipton, tax partner of the accounting firm Ernst & Whinney. If a host want to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guests, Mr. Lipton says. One safety measure: make a business-oriented speech, Mr. Block suggests. He also advise party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection. That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, be hold a pre-super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guests include business leaders, entertainment personalities and customers. Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, say the bash be tax deductible because ""our sales people will be there and business will be discussed."" He admits, however, ""We're not go to twist any arms. We're there to say thank-you to those who've give us business."" An IRS spokesman say more agents will be assign to corporate audits of business-entertainment expenses this year. But IRS enforcement of the rules could be as difficult as block the New York Giants' Lawrence Taylor. ""as a practical matter, as long as people say they talk business at a Super Bowl party, how can the IRS dispute it?"" say Vickie King, a Price Waterhouse tax official. ""the only people who will get into trouble be those who don't keep receipts.""president Bush congratulate the San Francisco49ers on Friday and say they rewrite the record books withtheir Super Bowl victory.

Sixty-three percent of TV viewers watched the lopsided game which also featured the conclusion of the ""Bud Bowl II,"" a $7 million Anheuser Bush ad campaign. Though the game can spotlight a community's problems, it also has tremendous economic impact.

Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

Ferries in India, Guatemala, Egypt, China and Bangladesh all carried far more passengers than authorized when they sank.  Captain error also contributed to accidents.  In Guatemala, a ferry captain was charges with negligent homicide when his boat which was being towed, sank after he failed to steer it.   A ferry sank off the Egyptian coast after inexplicably leaving standard navigational channels and ramming a coral reef in stormy seas.  In that accident, survivors claimed that crewmembers abandoned ship without helping them.  The ship's engineer denied the charges.  Two boats carrying Somali refugees sank off the coast of Kenya, resulting in more than 140 deaths, although the cause of the sinking was not reported. An overcrowded ferry in Bangladesh sank with almost double the passengers it was authorized.  In a separate ferry incident in Bangladesh, pirates robbed passengers and threw six overboard. In the Indian accident, monsoon rains may have contributed as well as overcrowding.  Even an advanced country such as Israel can experience ferry accidents.  Nineteen U.S. sailors died when an Israeli ferry sank while returning the sailors to the USS Saratoga.  No cause was reported."

I send her asincere letter, because at that time I be a true believer inrock's great love story. ... I tell her, `i'm in your corner,'goldman recalled.ono never responded. And after 1,200 interviews and 6{ years,the dream be over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the greataltered.expecting the best, Goldman claim to have uncover the worst:a volatile, debauch Lennon who evolve into the Howard Hughes ofrock 'n' roll, tuck in his Dakota bed for days at a time.That vision of the ex-beatle have infuriate Lennon supporters,family and friends and prompt charges of fiction writing; it alsotaught Goldman who say he be a John Lennon fan a hard lesson.it doesn't pay to meet your idols. Just enjoy them; don't tryto see the reality, Goldman said. My books be a cold dose ofreality. You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goescold.goldman, whose past tell-all biographies deal with ElvisPresley and Lenny Bruce, remain unmoved by the hue and cry fromthe music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, PaulMcCartney.My books be bad for business, Goldman say in a phoneinterview from Munich, West Germany. They're bad for Paul'sbusiness, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rockbusiness. Those people have to hate me.myth-shattering be a not a bad thing, Goldman said. For example,he cites Lennon's disillusion meeting with Presley at Gracelandin 1965.John be very hooked into Elvis. Elvis be his measure ofsuccess, say Goldman. And the myth of Elvis: awesome. But thereality of Elvis: a mess.goldman also reject the complaint raise by Ono, McCartney,Julian Lennon and others that Lennon be an easy target to defamebecause he's no longer around to answer the allegations.you can't say John lacks for defenders. And Yoko isn't dead.colonel Parker (Presley's manager) isn't dead. ninety-five percentof the people in my books aren't dead. They can do something aboutit, say Goldman, his voice quickening.this business of make it easy for defend myself isinsane. I'm the target of scores of attacks.

She label Goldman's version of life with the Lennonstotally fiction and bring out Lennon's sons, julian and12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography.these giant promotions of Yoko be present as honestdocumentaries, when they're in-house documentaries, say Goldman,who compliment Ono on a well-prepared show. She take nochances. This be another no-chance yoko.as for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse byyoko and John, wild drink binges, anorexia and reclusiveness,goldman say it all fit together with the image of lennonpresented by those who know him.my thesis be John Lennon be a divided mind. Every yin have ayang, say Goldman. There be nothing more natural than for Johnto try the other side (sexually). That's just the kind of guy hewas. He want to try everything once.a biography that portray John Lennon as adrug-addled, anorexic bisexual who rag his way from Liverpool tonew York City be totally fiction, Yoko Ono say in a nationalradio broadcast.it's amaze that somebody take such a poetic license.

He spend so much time with me not just athome, but everywhere, you know.say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, ""The Lives of John Lennon"" (Morrow, $22.95), but you've get to hand it to him: This guy be one ambitious sleazemonger. most best-selling pop biographers play it safe: They choose a celeb of respectable, not to say pristine, reputation, and then they proceed to blacken it, preferably by recount vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealings, even, in some cases, dyslexia. The result portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell be duly present in hardback form to the public, which in turn be so shocked and disgust that it force itself to buy the biography by the millions. A can't-miss formula, surely. Albert Goldman's previous victim in the genre be Elvis Presley. now Mr. Presley was, if you'll forgive the expression, a fat target for a writer of Mr. Goldman's methods. His title notwithstanding, the ""king of Rock 'n' Roll"" be in truth more a creature of the old show biz, a star whose wholesome image, carefully create by P.R. wizards, be ripe for debunking. But in choose Mr. Lennon as his next target, Mr. Goldman appear to be try to debunk the undebunkable. For apart from his puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he give be his own squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on. By his own accounting, then, Mr. Lennon be not about to dethrone Ward Cleaver as the all-american dad. His public love him in spite of it all -- or perhaps because of it all. Mr. Lennon grow to celebrity during a time when such transgressions as intemperance and adultery (quaint terms!) be lose their social sting. His candor -- if that's what it was, and not simple logorrhea -- redeem everything. And so it be on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attacks his subject. The leitmotif of Mr. Lennon's confessions be that his bad days be behind him, and that with Yoko Ono he have at last learn to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity. now Mr. Goldman be here to announce: He didn't tell you the half of it. Hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness, percolate with the ""scoops"" that have by now be widely publicize in People magazine, ""west 57th"" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon have a thing for young boys; that his marriage to Ms. Ono be pock by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterize his first marriage; that he have a sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit. The squalid revelations dribble out like a chemical leak, slim up every page. Remarkably, then, the sleazemonger's art have triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon be even bad than John Lennon's John Lennon. A great deal of this muck manage to splash onto Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portray as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploit Mr. Lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth. Mr. Goldman, alas, allow to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this be a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well. The keepers of the Lennon flame have of course be quick to point this out. Ms. Ono and her son have take the path prefer by offend celebrities, they have hit the talk show to display their wounds. And Rolling Stone magazine, long the house organ for the Lennon publicity machine, recently publish an extensive rebuttal to the book, which be undercut by a tone of priggish indignation border on the comic. criticize ""the Lives of John Lennon"" for insufficient respect to the fall Beatle's legacy be rather off the point -- like condemn Charles Manson for his bad table manners. The book may indeed be inaccurate, as critics have charged. But one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate Mr. Goldman's book. There is, for starters, the sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive of the grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman be the sort of writer who refer to pop songs as ""pieces,"" as though they be concerti. There be his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- toward drugs, sex, music -- that give him license to second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. And there be the awkward organization, in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on Mr. Lennon, while major events be skip over lightly because -- there go the advance! -- they might reveal Mr. Lennon in a flattering light. All of which indicate why ""the Lives of John Lennon"" be such a wretched book: not because it make a good man look bad, but because it show no other purpose than to make a man -- whether a good man or a bad one, we laymen will probably never know -- look bad. John Lennon, while he be alive, do enough of that himself to satisfy all but the low appetites. ---mr. Ferguson be assistant manage editor of The american Spectator.At this point, Lennon say he become a househusband to theirchild while Yoko run the family business. The arrangement continueduntil Lennon tell the woman he call Mother it be time tomake music again. Double Fantasy follow just before John'sdeath, although it be not to be Lennon's swan song.bruce Springsteen have release three albums since 1980; MichaelJackson two.

Yoko say she couldn't imagine peoplewalking around on John's drawings.back at the Dakota, Ono receive a familiar question: be thisall commercialism? have the iconoclastic ex-beatle be sell out?she laughs.no. I didn't sell out John. And I'm sure John would be happyi'm still keep him out there. ... there's a commercial aspect,yes, but I mean, why not?

24,d097e,"While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph windroared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watch the fury it ventedon his beloved, 300-year-old city.riley, city officials and a few reporters stay in Charleston'shistoric City Hall through Thursday night as the area's worsthurricane in three decades pound the coastal city where the CivilWar began.late in the day, there be hope Hugo might spare Charleston. Butthe storm gather strength and speed as it spin straight towardthis city, which have survive a number of near misses from greatstorms in recent years.From the moment it become apparent Hugo might strike thesoutheast coast, many Charlestonians concede that, this time, theirnumber be up.as Hugo's wind howl outside the plywood boards protect thewindows, reporters wander in and out of Riley's office. On hisdesk several candles burn as insurance against the inevitable lossof power.later there be a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof rippedoff and water seep down on the burnish wood tables in the CityCouncil chamber. Phone and electric service to the city command postwas knock out.during it all, Riley kept in close contact with the NationalWeather Service. As the eye of the storm passed, he take reportersonto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at thedamage.the initial view, sketch out in the glow of flashlights, wasunsettling: The tin roof be toss in the gutter, slate tiles werescattered on the ground. Bricks, sticks and leaves litter thestreet.this be the eye of the hurricane. I've never be in one and Ihope I'm never in one again, Riley said. It's scarcely a latesummer breeze.As the storm die before dawn, Riley be out on the streets againin a raincoat carry a flashlight to get a good assessment ofthe damage.serious but fixable, the mayor concluded.damage from Hurricane Hugo, which storm through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers. New york-based American International Group Inc. expect net losses relate to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. Analysts say AIG have tell them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remain damages. AIG insure property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., base in St. Paul, Minn, say the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount take into consideration what St. Paul expect to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said. philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. be expect to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimate that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduce by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. say its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimate claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpass the company's record payout for a single disaster. When damages in North Carolina and Virginia be added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million. It say that be more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise ofseveral hurricane forecasters predict the destructive pathhurricane Hugo would follow, give people plenty of time to fleethe South Carolina coast.but hurricane track remain an uncertain science.Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center use computer modelsto track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions andforecasting changes in those conditions be embody in thosemodels, say Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall be difficult, butforecasters say Friday that the landfall be predict in time forevacuation.overall, I think the tracking models give us a very good ideawhere Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in atimely manner, say research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem with Hugo be predict theintensity of the storm, which be upgrade to a Category 4 hurricanejust hours before it slam into Charleston.It be very difficult to predict changes in intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer models for that, McAdie said.we really need to improve on our forecast ability of strength.the hurricane specialists be surprise by the last-minuteincrease in wind speed, which be report to them by Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who have track hurricanes for 35years, say that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting toolswere reports from aircraft or ships.we have no radar or satellites then, so needless to say ourforecasts be less accurate, Clark said.in the late 1960s, the weather service begin use satellites toobtain a global weather picture. information from the satellite isused to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models thattelevision viewers see every night.using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at thenational Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where a track model constantly change toaccount for current weather conditions and the position of thehurricane.to determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyzesupercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similarstorms and the current path of the hurricane.then they make an educated guess about the landfall.meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the MassachussettsInstitute of Technology criticize the current forecasting system.congress and the american people be suffer from thecollective delusion that our data problems have be solve bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enoughinformation about the wind and temperatures that affect ahurricane's path.most of the information actually use to predict hurricanescomes from fly airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures be improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have to remember that those models use be only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of theforecaster to predict the storm's path.Residents take forecasters at their wordwhen they warn of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number ofdeaths from the powerful storm can be credit to this healthyrespect, authorities said.the storm, which cause billions in damage, claim 17 lives insouth Carolina, and only two be in the Charleston area, whichbore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.we just feel very thankful about that, say Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousands of people who be in the sheltersand the tens of thousands of people who evacuate inland werepotential victims of injury and death.riley and other officials credit residents with monitor thehurricane as it spin toward Charleston, and heed evacuationwarnings.the last big storm to hit South Carolina be Hurricane David in1979, which hit the coast after pound southern Florida.Since then several big storms have threaten but veered away,and officials be worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've have so many close calls, say Gary Garnet, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service.But this storm be very, very strong, he said. This timethey realize it.glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimate that 18,000residents in Charleston and the three surround counties headedfor shelters.Tens of thousands more get into their cars and head upinterstate 26 toward Columbia.Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related deaths, credit people for heed thewarnings.it be bad, but it could have be a lot worse, he said.you've just get to say nice things about the people.meanwhile, Garnet have some good news for storm-wearycharlestonians: late Saturday the tropics be quiet with no otherstorms brewing.there's nothing to worry about out there, he said.hurricane Hugo strike South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents insoutheastern states grab what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.this be a disaster star us right in the eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. say from his City Hall command post in Charleston,where the hurricane down power lines, snap trees and causedutility transformers to explode.all we can do now be pray and hope all the precautions we havetaken have be sufficient, Riley say as Hugo's eye bore in onthe city. I just hope and pray we can get through this without anyloss of life.by midnight, 119 mph winds be report in Charleston. The roofcracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that haswithstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water pour into thepaneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the commandpost be knock out.hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, andabout three hours later the eye of the storm pass over the Isle ofpalms just east of Charleston, say Bob Sheets, director of thenational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.The eye be about 10 miles across and top winds be still at 135mph.Hugo be expect to turn gradually to the north, cause severeflooding as it move up the East Coast. The storm pose a 19 percentchance of hit New York City and a 16 percent chance of hittingboston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.as Hugo near the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,200 miles north, be nearly empty, as be the boarded-up resorttowns themselves. Power lines and trees be down in some spotsand water flood roads. Stop lights and neon lights be knockedout in Myrtle Beach.One eyewitness say `It's like a light show,' say AmyGarrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.In Charleston, the hurricane litter streets with tin roofs,palmetto fronds and chunks of bark. Businesses be closed andclasses at public schools and universities canceled. Riley orderedresidents of one-story homes to evacuate.Hospitals stockpile supplies, discharge any patients wellenough to go and move others to hospitals inland to make room foremergency patients, officials said.about 12,000 people have check into 83 shelters across the stateas of Thursday evening, and more be expected, say bennish Brown,a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220miles northwest of here.we try to close the doors but people be sneak in sidedoors, say Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse work at theconway high School shelter near Myrtle Beach. We try to postguards at the doors, but people be still come in.american Red Cross relief efforts be buckle under the numberof evacuees, say Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., whoappealed for help.right now the Red Cross be shelter tens of thousands ofpeople all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course be at the sametime that we're shelter 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and theother Caribbean islands.we're begin to feel the squeeze. Our resources be verytight. Right now Hugo be shape up to be one of our big reliefoperations of the decade.at midnight, the center of Hugo be near latitude 32.7 degreesnorth and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. Thehurricane's speed have pick up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.near its center, Hugo's muscle reach winds of 135 mph, up from125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North andSouth Carolina can expect tornadoes link to Hugo for the next twodays, accord to the hurricane center.the coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12hours once the eye come ashore, officials said. A hurricane warningwas in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.By late afternoon, Hugo be upgrade to a category 4 hurricane onthe Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,which indicate it could cause extreme damage.it strengthen more than we think it would, Sheets said,adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it move up theappalachians.the timing of the landfall be critical because of the storm'stidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would fee anormal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.on top of that will be waves, Sheets say earlier, and inmany places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept cleanoff.it's take the devastation cause byhurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debtbetween two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.as a way of repay a kindness date to 1778, Kingston israising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.after Kingston, then New York's capital, be burn in October1777 by the British, New York Gov.

I figure theyhelped us, we should do something for them, Ford said.on Wednesday, a local Red Cross chapter begin collectingdonations for victims of the hurricane.a lot of people have be calling, ask to send donationsdown there, say Susan Lawlor, executive director of the UlsterCounty Chapter of the Red Cross.On Tuesday, New York state send two airplanes full of food,clothing and water to parts of the Caribbean ravage by Hugo.

Riley Jr.Hugo be the first major hurricane to strike Charleston sincehurricane Gracie come ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.The seaside community have suffer through many disasters, bothnatural and man-made.the worst in recent decades be in 1938 when a tornado torethrough the city, kill 32 people, injure hundreds and causingan estimate $2 million in property damage.charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures liningquaint streets and alleyways, be where the Civil War begin in 1861.The city have survive the shot and shell of two wars and anynumber of small hurricanes, politely refer to by Charlestoniansof refinement as September gales.but the bad natural disaster to beset the city occur on thehot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumble in what somefolks think be a prelude to Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake be felt as far away as Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, theearthquake claim an estimate 110 lives, destroy 102 buildingsand toss most of the city's 14,000 chimney into the streets.in recent years, the city have attract millions of visitorsannually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby finesand beaches.charleston have receive international acclaim as home to SpoletoFestival U.S.A., found by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive artsfestival.hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costly storm insurers have face so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say. The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, be expect to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow. ""Hugo will be the big hurricane loss on record,"" say one official, far surpass the $752.5 million insurers pay out after Frederick rip through several Gulf Coast states in 1979. The impact on premium rates could be minimal for now, analysts expect, because the big losses will be in the personal insurance area -- for homes and autos. Most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future. In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have be relatively mild, so insurers haven't have to dip into these funds. And since Hugo also storm through the Caribbean, foreign insurers be at risk for some of the damage on those islands. Yet, some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in come months. Rates have be fall since late 1986. Udayan Ghose at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believe these reasons might cause rates to edge high by mid-1990. For the time being, the losses from Hugo ""will be substantial, but they won't be something the industry can't handle,"" say Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James & Co., a New york-based insurance broker. For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimate it will pay claims total more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses. nationwide Insurance Co., a mutual company base in Columbus, Ohio, say Hugo ""is the single large claims disaster"" it have see in its 63-year history. The company, which be the large home and auto insurer in North Carolina and no. 3 in South Carolina, have already receive 16,000 claims from the stricken region. Claims could total $100 million, a spokesman said. For some insurers, Hugo be a double-whammy. New york-based Continental Corp., which be a big insurer in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, say it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter, reflect its net exposure to the damages cause by the hurricane. ""hugo will be particularly costly to us,"" say John P. Mascotte, Continental's chairman. philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which have extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit, and USF&G Corp. in Baltimore, a big insurer in the Carolina region, could also be force to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings, analysts said. Some of USF&G's losses hit very close home -- its Charleston office be destroy by the hurricane. Both USF&G and Cigna decline to predict whether they would take a charge; USF&G say it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of losses, and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses. Hugo could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at Travelers Corp., Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., accord to industry analysts. Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believe that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough ""financial pain, such as not be able to pay shareholder dividends,"" to compel them to boost premium rates right away. He explain that in the first six months of this year, net income for the industry decline slightly from 1988, but insurance companies be still earn an adequate rate of return on equity. He also note that the industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently at $125 billion, be also plentiful. Generally, insurers can book about $3 of premiums for every $1 of surplus. Right now, premiums total about $200 billion, he said. An official at Nationwide Insurance note that the company have $1 of surplus for every $2 of insurance that it writes. Insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by pay another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses. Michael Lewis at Dean Witter Reynolds say losses from Hugo could be big enough to ""temporarily"" increase reinsurance rates. Although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some companies, the losses they must still cover could hurt third-quarter results. Niagara Exchange Corp., base in Buffalo, N.Y., say Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit face as a result of the hurricane. State Farm, the nation's large home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance. It believe its reserves be plentiful enough to absorb its losses, a spokesman said.

27,d098e,"already they're say it's thebiggest happen in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to atelescope.so, step right up folks, and discover the wonders of theuniverse. See how big it is. Learn its age. Look at light created14 billion years ago and arrive at your eye only this instant.ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the BigBang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago. See stars bear and seethem die. Watch galaxies form. Follow the flow of gas into themilky Way's halo. Peer deep into the universe, past so many starsin our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetimeto count, to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about 200billion stars.for scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomespossible now that the space shuttle Discovery have carry thehubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one have seenbefore. The telescope, a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck,has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faint light.light, speed along at 186,000 miles a second, be themessenger of creation. track the trail of light from today tothe first moments contain all the information we will ever haveabout the creation of the universe.the hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps tothe first echoes of creation. This be a world-class event, even ifastronomy be not your thing.superlatives?in the history of optical astronomy there have be two greatleaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in theautumn of 1609, and the hubble Space Telescope in April 1990. Eric J. Chaisson, a senior scientist at the Space Telescope ScienceInstitute in Baltimore.One more?no one ever make anything that good, James Westphal,California Institute of Technology.Another?Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predict that thehubble telescope will literally be the dawn of a new era inastronomy.Eras rarely can be proclaim in advance. But the HST, namedafter Edwin Powell Hubble, hold that kind of promise.hubble be an astronomer in the first half of the century whoconcluded not only that distant galaxies be move away from Earthbut that the farther away they are, the faster they move. Thetheory of an expand universe support the belief that theuniverse originate in a cosmic explosion and that all matter isstill rush from the site of that so-called Big Bang.Astronomers think the Big Bang occur 12 billion to 20 billionyears ago and send the entire universe fly out at incrediblespeed and heat. eventually matter cool and condense intogalaxies, stars and planets.There be big telescopes than the Hubble, but they be all onearth and all subject to a major limitation the atmosphere which be fine for breathe but lousy for see through. Theproblem of skywatching through layers of air have be liken tobirdwatching from the bottom of a swim pool.the Voyager spacecraft, which send back astonishing views ofearth's sister planets, have to travel 12 years to get close enoughfor pictures as they whiz past. With the Hubble, say scientistedward Weiler, such pictures be possible any time we want.the telescope be 42.5 by 14 feet and consists of a 94.5-inchprimary mirror that gathers incoming light.on a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two milesaway, say Weiler, chief NASA scientist on the Hubble project.with a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000miles away. With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia fromwashington.ground controllers at the GoddardSpace Flight Center finally make contact today with the two mainantennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after tryingfor more than six hours to lock on.applause erupt in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md.,as the glitch that mar Hubble's first full day in space wassolved.we have confirmation that we have achieve communication withthe Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antennasystem, say NASA's Dave Drachlis.Engineers have say all along they believe the antennas wereworking all right and that the problem be in incorrectly pointingeither the satellite or the TDRS, an orbit communicationssatellite that act as a switchboard.in the successful attempt, they nearly double the width of theantennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2degrees to 10.8 degrees.The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmitinformation at a much slow rate and can be use in emergencies,were work well.space shuttle Discovery be 46 miles away, available to remedycertain problems. The outage be not a problem for which spacewalkers would have be summoned.the five astronauts be otherwise busy make pictures ofstorms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doingexperiments.steve Terry, director of a team calibrate various aspects ofthe telescope, say the first outage be cause by human error andwas not a serious problem. It begin between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT andlasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.the second failure occur at 6:44 a.m. when controllersattempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gainantennas through the TDRS.This time it be a pointing problem, say Jim Elliott, agoddard spokesman. It's a new spacecraft and we thinkinexperience deal with it be the cause.the telescope, embark on a 15-year search for new worlds, wasreleased from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minutesnag that almost send two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.mission Control awaken the crew early today with a loudrendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite.good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after thatsong, say Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There be alot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday andhubble have a good night while you be asleep.we appreciate the good words from everybody, replieddiscovery Commander Loren Shriver.After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently back Discoveryaway from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series ofmaneuvers, the last one complete this morning, to parkdiscovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.The telescope really look great as we fly away from it, andwe sure hope it do good work, Shriver say Wednesday.Well, it sure be now, Loren, and thanks for all the great workyou've done, reply Mission Control. Galileo be real proud ofyou.Scientists have hail the Hubble NASA's most expensiveunmanned spacecraft as the great advance in astronomy sincegalileo raise a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescopewhile controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble isoperating properly, such as respond to directional commands.the next milestone be Friday, when the telescope's 10-footaperture door be to be opened, expose the finely polished94.5-inch mirror to starlight.then on Tuesday, NASA expect to release the first image fromthe telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.Data will follow in a month or two.if the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery couldreturn to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalkto fix it.hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik say the telescope would betested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture dooris opened.We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger thehubble by put the aperture door close to the sunlight, hesaid. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitiveinstruments.on Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley use the shuttle's50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoistit from the cargo bay.one of the telescope's solar arrays unreel from its mast asexpected and start provide power to the telescope's batteries,which otherwise have only eight hours of charge.but there be trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budgewhen the latches be released, and then move about a fifth of its39-foot length and stop again. The panel roll all the way outon the third attempt.by the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and KathrynSullivan be in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes awayfrom take tools in hand and go on an outer-space maintenancecall.wojtalik say the cause of the problem be unknown.the 8{-hour procedure be perform 380 miles above Earth, 70miles high than any shuttle have ever flown. The orbit wasdictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distortingatmosphere.Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost thebeginning of the time, study stars and galaxies so distant theirlight have take 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope todetermine how and when the universe be formed, currently estimatedat 15 billion years ago.the telescope originally be schedule for launch in 1983 butwas delay by technical problems and the Challenger accident.discovery, which blast into orbit Tuesday, be schedule toland Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.Five astronauts board Discoverytoday for a second try at send the hubble Space Telescope intoorbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues tothe begin of time.Astronomers be start to tingle again in anticipation ofwhat the Hubble will be able to accomplish, say Lennard Fisk,head of NASA science activities.air Force forecasters say there be a 90 percent chance theweather would be favorable for launch the shuttle at thescheduled time of 8:31 a.m. edt.more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquidoxygen be pump into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.the astronauts, wear bright orange flight suits, climb intothe crew cabin just as dawn be break over the Kennedy SpaceCenter.The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will giveastronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have, saidwilliam Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.it's go to change our perspective altogether. I can't saywhat we're go to learn, but I'll be astound if we don't learnmany new things.discovery be aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the high ashuttle have ever gone, so the telescope can be place in its properorbit far above Earth's distort atmosphere. It be the 35thshuttle mission.columbia, which journey into space next month with the Astroobservatory, sit on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only thesecond time both pads have be occupied; the first be in 1986just before the Challenger explosion.hubble have be wait to take its place in space since 1983,delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. Thelatest postponement occur April 10, when Discovery's launch wasscrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power uniton the shuttle.the mood at the Kennedy Space Center be considerably lessfestive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds ofastronomers gather with their families.The day after launch, mission specialist Steven a. Hawley willuse the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescopeinto space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and KathrynSullivan will assist if a problem develops.discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two daysuntil after its lens cap be opened, expose the finely polished94.5-inch mirror to starlight.hubble be not expect to start provide scientific data bysatellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA say itwill release its first image an open star cluster in theconstellation Carina a week after launch.in addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million hasbeen spend on spare parts, astronaut training and computer softwareto operate the instrument. The european Space Agency contributed$250 million for 15 percent of the view time.nasa estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate andmaintain the telescope in space.during its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provideastronomers with 10 times good resolution and 25 times moresensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they willbe able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light have beentraveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe be create 15billion years ago as believe and uncover some of the mysterysurrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also isexpected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.the telescope be name for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,who discover during the 1920s that the universe be expanding. Hiswork give rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe be createdby a tremendous explosion.in addition to Hubble, Discovery carry a human skull filledwith sensors to measure the space radiation that astronautsreceive. It be the skull's third trip into space.the shuttle be to end its five-day mission with a landing atEdwards Air Force Base, Calif.Seven years late, the Hubble SpaceTelescope be where it belongs, out of this world and in search ofothers so distant that they may have be form at the beginningof time.less than five hours after it ride into space aboard the shuttlediscovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope send its firsttest radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheers eruptedin Mission Control in Houston.As near as we can tell, everything look perfect, saidastronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesdaywill be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.discovery, trail an arc of white smoke into a brilliant bluesky, carry the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 milesabove earth high by 70 miles than any previous shuttle. Therethe Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creationwith instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.our window on the universe! NASA launch commentator GeorgeDiller exult as the Discovery rise off its seaside launch pad.it's a beautiful day to have hubble Space Telescope in orbitinstead of here on Earth like it's be for so many years, saidnasa administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's in its element and I'mdelighted.The telescope be suppose to be launch in 1983, but technicalproblems and the Challenger accident delay its deployment. itsuffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown wasstopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faultyhydraulic unit on the shuttle.while it remain on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million amonth to exercise and keep in readiness. In its first day in space,that checkout and test continue remotely under control of thegoddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.On hand to watch the Discovery launching be a contingent ofscientists who have hail the Hubble as the great advance inastronomy since Galileo raise a small telescope to his eyes nearly400 years ago.truly refer to the early-day astronomer when he be askedabout the long delays in get the telescope to its workingstation.somebody the other day said, `who remembers the day thatgalileo pick up his telescope to look at the stars?' saidtruly, a former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day welaunch Hubble, it matter that we do it right.the telescope be 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about thesize of a railroad tank car. When it fly free, it will receiveelectrical power for its six scientific instruments from twowing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side.it be name after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whotheorized that the universe be expand and that the farther awaya galaxy is, the faster it be traveling. That give support to thetheory that a massive explosion the Big Bang create theuniverse 10 to 20 billion years ago.the Hubble be expect to help provide the answer to two majorquestions: How old be the universe? How big be it?the telescope have two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, theother 12 inches. Two of the instruments be cameras, two arespectrometers and one be a photometer. In addition, the finepointing system act as a sixth instrument by provide precisemeasurement of distances.on Wednesday, Hawley be to grapple the 12{-ton telescope withthe shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, pointit, and after a long checkout drop it overboard to orbit on itsown.in the cargo bay, the telescope receive electrical power fromthe shuttle. But the juice be cut when the instrument be lift outand it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels areextended to receive light from the sun.should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists BruceMcCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be stand by, partiallydressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay tounfurl the arrays manually.discovery's launch be not without its problems.with 31 seconds leave in the countdown, the computer that runsthe final moments before liftoff refuse to close a fuel valve andstopped the launch process. The problem be overcome and theshuttle lift off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.the shuttle be schedule to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT atEdwards Air Force Base in California.On the way uphill, as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, theshuttle's windshield be splatter with several flecks ofthings. He say the windshield be streak by the debris andthat it also be smear when the spent booster rockets fell offduring the climb to orbit.the astronauts also have problems with their UHF radio circuit,and one of the ship's small rear thrusters be inoperative. Neitherproblem be consider serious.discovery's astronauts overcamebalky equipment to send the hubble Space Telescope float freefrom the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of theuniverse.the $1.5 billion telescope begin orbit Earth every 97.3minutes at an altitude of 380 miles high above the atmosphere,which have limit the view of ground-based telecopes.discovery, go for hubble release, Mission Control tell thecrew at 3:37 p.m. EDT. The event occur a minute later as theshuttle slowly and carefully back away.the final hours before its release be a nightmare for groundcontrollers as they command the unfurling of two solar panelsthat power the telescope's instruments.the starboard panel balk twice as it be be pull from itsreel. Mission Control order space-walking astronauts to be readyto go out of the cabin to help. But there be a third try and itwas successful.we have confirmation that the solar array wing on thestarboard side have be deployed, the telescope control center inmaryland said.so we have good news, say Dave Drachlis, of the Hubblecontrol center.the deployment of the two 39-foot panels allow sun power toflow into the telescope's batteries, relieve worries that theywould use up their eight-hour charge.before astronaut Steve Hawley be able to lift the 12{-tontelescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, itsinstruments have to be disconnect from the shuttle's power andshifted over to the batteries.precisely one day after lift off from Launch Pad 39B atkennedy Space Center, the hubble Space Telescope be ready to fly onits own, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The game hasbegun. The race be on. The clock be ticking.astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put onspacesuits and enter an airlock in order to be ready to walkoutside and pull out the array have mechanical deployment of thesolar panels failed.cameras aboard Discovery show the telescope, be hold at theend of a 50-foot crane, reflect sunlight from its silver surfaceand a turn earth in the background.earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. shrivermaneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position, with its nosepointed toward the sun. That be to put the telescope's solararrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly startcollecting energy and protect the telescope's fix star trackerswhile the instrument be be hold above the payload bay.discovery be in orbit 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higherthan any previous shuttle. The orbit be dictate by the need toput the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.for those technically inclined this morning, I'd like to passon the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer (hawley),something to the effect that the big marble sure look far awaytoday, Shriver said.the five astronauts' busy day begin on a musical note early thismorning as Mission Control play a song call Space be OurWorld, write by members of Discovery's training team and ahouston-area group, Private Numbers.Controllers monitor the telescope at Goddard Space FlightCenter in Maryland say Tuesday that no problems have be detectedso far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmannedspacecraft ever built.everything have just be go like clockwork, say RonSchlagheck, shift director of orbital verifications at Goddard.Everybody be in excellent spirits.the Hubble telescope, delay by technical problems and the 1986Challenger accident, have wait seven years to take its place inspace. It finally get a ride into orbit Tuesday morning aboarddiscovery.hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies sodistant their light have take 14 billion years to reach Earth. Itis expect to provide clues to the age and size of the universe,and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holesand even find stars with planets that could conceivably supportlife.the 24,250-pound telescope be 43 feet long and 14 feet indiameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it be inorbit, it will receive electrical power for its six scientificinstruments from two winglike solar arrays.it be name for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whosediscovery during the 1920s that the universe be expand give riseto the Big Bang theory that the universe be create by atremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.the hubble Space Telescope wasawakened from its self-induced sleep today but it be still withoutthe use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instrumentswere on hold, unable to begin any observations.We be out of the `safe-mode' right now, say Steve Terry, asupervisor of the engineers control the telescope. He say thetelescope be run on a normal control-all mode, where itsown computers and sensors guide where it be pointing.discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, pack their gear for areturn to Earth Sunday, make some last-minute observations of Earthand talk with ground-based reporters about their flight.pilot Charles Bolden say he be especially upbeat about thewidespread public awareness of the telescope, which be expectedeventually to look back 14 billion light years nearly to thebirth of the universe.it's hard to go somewhere and find someone who have never heardof the hubble Space Telescope, say Bolden. It make littlekids' eyes light up. It make little kids want to learn how to addand subtract and study science.the telescope's big eye have remain open, but Hubble have beenin a safe mode with all motion stop because of earlierproblems in link the high-speed dish antennas with a relaysatellite. The antennas be the primary links for relayingscientific data to the ground.terry say that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recordersin the telescope read telemetry signals from all its systems andthat these would be play to Earth and analyze when the antennasare work properly.We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, hesaid. Engineers be able to send commands to the telescope via itssecondary antennas but the communications system be not useful forscientific data, which must be transmit at a high rate of speed.we're put the scientific instruments in a hold mode, ineffect a standby mode, he said.shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Md., complete a series of commandsthat take the telescope out of its safe mode and then begin to runa 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.it will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope isoperating the way it be suppose to at this point in the startupprocess, say hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.We're back up to a very deliberate and slow and carefulapproach to these problems, Olivier say Friday. This be notthe time to do anything dumb.the telescope problems have put the flight center several daysbehind, but the five astronauts who deploy it earlier this weekwere stick to their schedule.landing be schedule for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif., but flight controllers be keep a closewatch on the weather.Winds be predict to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph attouchdown.the shuttle carry enough supplies to stay in orbit three daysbeyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.mission Control awaken the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDTtoday by play the song, Cosmos.Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate fortoday, say Commander Loren Shriver.The song be select in honor of hubble Space Telescope,which be now open for business, say Mission Control commentatorjames Hartsfield.The astronauts be to finish up their experiments andphotography today and pack for the trip home. They also plan tohold a news conference from space with reporters at the JohnsonSpace Center.Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden be to run through a series oftests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets wereready for return to Earth.The crew deploy Hubble on Wednesday but they have stay closeto the telescope in case there be trouble open the aperturedoor. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivanwere prepare to perform a space walk today to crank it open inorbit 380 miles above Earth.But that prove unnecessary when the door be open Fridaymorning, expose the telescope's finely polish 94.5-inch eye tostarlight for the first time.two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stoppedworking when the door opened, but engineers later get them back online. The gyroscopes be knock out by the motion and that, too,kept the telescope in the safe mode, say Dave Drachlis, directorof orbital verifications at Goddard.A colleague, Steve Terry, say Hubble's systems be set atconservative limits for the first operations and that cause manymalfunctions. There also be two communications outages totalingseveral hours.hubble be design with safe modes so it can be the master ofits own destiny in case contact with an orbit communicationssystem be lose for extend periods, Terry said.nasa have plan to release its first test image from thetelescope on Tuesday, show an open star cluster in theconstellation Carina. But Terry say that would be delay becauseof the antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month ortwo.the telescope, name for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to lookback 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of theuniverse.the universe be believe to have be create about 15 billionyears ago in a cosmic explosion.hubble provide the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.he discover during the 1920s that the universe be expand andthat the farther the galaxy be from Earth, the faster it be movingaway.The hubble Space Telescope orbitedwith its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcamecommunications problems and lift its lens cover, but itselectronics be shut down due to a malfunction.those problems, however, be not the immediate concern ofshuttle Discovery's astronauts, who prepare for Sunday's return toearth.you've be release from hubble support. It's on its own,mission Control's Story Musgrave tell the five crew members.that's great news, reply Discovery commander Loren J.Shriver.There be handshakes and smile all around up here. I'll betit's just that way back down there, too, add mission specialiststeven Hawley. Who's buying tonight?we'll buy when you all get back, Musgrave replied.flight director William Reeves say it be too early to cheer.`we still have an important part of the mission to go, Reevessaid. We reserve our celebration until the crew be safely on theground.discovery be to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif. Landing would have be delay a day ifastronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan have have to performa space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperturedoor.the shuttle trail 50 miles behind hubble when the aperturedoor open 380 miles above Earth, but pass 3.7 miles beneath thetelescope later in the day.the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have plan torelease its first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope ontuesday, show an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.But Steve Terry, director of orbital verifications, say that wouldbe delay by problems with Hubble's high-speed antennas.scientific data will follow in a month or two.hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door be open to theheavens at 10:30 a.m. EDT, nearly four hours later than planned,exposing its finely polish 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for thefirst time.ground controllers send a signal command the door to lifteven though the telescope be in an automatic safe mode, withall motion stop because of problems in link its high-speeddish antenna with a relay satellite.one of the two antennas apparently have swing too far, and thetelescope shut down, say Jean Oliver, a hubble deputy projectmanager. If future movements of the antenna have to be limit toavoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on thetelescope's observe time, Oliver said.terry say the opening of the aperture door could not have beendelayed much longer.there have to be a point where you say they have to go theirway and we have to go ours, he say of the astronauts.when the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizinggyroscopes stop working; later, engineers get them back on line.the motion of the lens cover knock out the gyros, say DaveDrachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. That, too,kept it in the safe mode.oliver say it would be Saturday morning before the telescope isbrought out of the safe mode. It will take another day to get theinstrument operate normally again, put controllers at Goddardseveral days behind.we're try to be very deliberate and try not to cut anycorners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at riskhere and we want to make sure we're do it properly, Oliversaid. We've get a long future ahead of us, and we want to makesure it start off on the right foot.nasa say the telescope be safe and in a stable position.Tolerances for the telescope systems be set particularlynarrow for the first operations and that be the cause of manymalfunctions, Terry said. In addition to that trouble, there weretwo communications outages total several hours.We're cautious, and that's natural, Terry said. We've gota very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anythingto jeopardize the usefulness. ...

The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,
28,d099e,"And for the sentimentalists, there will be 83-year-old Johnny Kelleystarting in his 60th Boston Marathon. There have only be 35 editions of thisrace run without him.; The last three Boston marathons have turn intoreckless speed duels. They have produce five of the top 10 times and eight ofthe top 15 in the race's storied history.; They also have result in arace of attrition, with many of the early speedsters burn out completely orfaltering in the late stages.; Along the historic route that begin inhopkinton, west of Boston, and end in Copley Square in the Back Bay sectionof the city, checkpoint records have fall at an alarm rate.; Forexample, all 11 checkpoint records be shatter through the first 20 mileslast year, either by Simon Robert Naali or Juma Ikangaa, both of Tanzania.Neither won.; The winner be 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, whooutsmarted the early pacesetters by run a patient, calculate race.;running alone about 200 meters behind a pack of six Africans, Bordin passedthem all by 21 miles and go on to win in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, thesecond-fastest time in the race's history, behind only the 2:07:51 by Rob decastella in 1986.; Ikangaa finish a distant second in 2:09:52. It be histhird consecutive runner-up finish in Boston.; Ikangaa be back again, alongwith several other formidable Africans. They include Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya,the 1988 winner in 2:08:43, the third-fastest time in Boston and one secondahead of Ikangaa; Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia, the 1989 champion in 2:09:06,Boston's eighth-best time; Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya, the 1987 world championand 1988 Olympic silver medalist who be make his Boston debut; and Naali,the third-place finisher in the 1990 Commonwealth Games.; Among thosechasing them will be John Treacy, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist and thethird-place finisher in Boston in 1988 and 1989; Geoff Smith, the Bostonwinner in 1984-85; Ed Eyestone, the top-ranked U.S. marathoner; SalvadorGarcia, the runner-up to Wakiihuri in last year's New York City Marathon; androlando Vera, who finish third in his marathon debut in Boston in 1990.;The women's division also be fill with many respectable entrants.;foremost among them be kristiansen, the 35-year-old norwegian who hold theworld record of 2:21:06 and win in Boston in 1986 and 1989, and Samuelson, 33,the u.s.-record holder at 2:21:21, 1984 Olympic gold medalist and Bostonchampion in 1979 and 1983.; challenge them will be Uta Pippig, WandaPanfil and Kim Jones.; Pippig finish second in Boston last year in acareer-best 2:28:03. Panfil win the London Marathon in 2:26:31, her personalbest, and win the New York City Marathon in 1990.TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and oneof the most prestigious events of the Games will be held. It be also withoutdoubt the most gruelling. Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollutionlevels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men'smarathon will prove one of the most physically demand ever run. There arelots of figures to show why. It be estimate that when the race begin inmataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be analready-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards the marathon's end, however, radiantheat throw off by buildings could be subject the runners to atemperature of up to 30`C. more debilitating still, relative humidity inbarcelona in August rises as high as 80 per cent. With more than 10kilometres still to go, most of the course be an upward run. The last 4.6km,which take the runners 60m high still to the Olympic stadium at the top ofthe hill of Montjuic, have an average gradient of more than 4.5 per cent, andincludes some sections of 7 per cent, equivalent in ski terms to a steep'red' run. But we do not need figures to convince us of the extraordinarydifficulty of tomorrow's race. last Saturday, in the Olympic stadium, iwatched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon, begin atthe same time of day and run in similar conditions. Never in any eventvoluntarily enter into, sport or otherwise, have I see such signs ofphysical and mental distress. The race be win by the Unified Team'sValentina Yegorova in 2 hours 32 minutes, a time considerably slow thanthat achieve by women on less demand Olympic marathon courses in LosAngeles and Seoul. After her near competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, camein eight seconds later, they have the energy - between bouts of grimace andlowering their heads to their knees - to embrace each other and smile forthe cameras.it be a different story in the 'mixed zone,' the area under the stadiumwhere athletes recover after their events. As runner after runner stumbledand limp into the room - several be bring in senseless on stretchers -the scene seem to be populate by exhausted boat people rescue afterweeks of exposure and deprivation at sea.As a photographer calmly shoot off a roll of film a foot from her face,manuela Machado of Mexico and another runner stand vomit violently into apotted palm. several competitors lay prone and gasping on the ground aswater be pour over them; others stand hunched over, grasp theirabdomens.if anyone move at all, it be with agonised face and the slow ofhobbles. These be not the sort of scenes likely to promote enthusiasm formarathon run or for the ideals of Olympic competition.chris Brasher, organiser of the London marathon, be on hand to witness thesuffering, and be incensed. Male marathon runners will face the same kindof problems with heat, humidity, and an over-demanding terrain, he said.in his opinion, gear the marathon to prime-time tv viewing and have theevent end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators wasunjustified and a 'sell-out to commercialism.'to put on the marathon in the late afternoon, rather than first thing inthe morning (the normal practice), and then to make them run 4km up a hillis just criminal in my opinion,' say Brasher, a former Olympic gold medalathlete and note sportswriter.I speak to Britain's Steve Brace, winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and1990, the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event.he agree that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regardsolympic marathon run as a pinnacle of his career, he be cautious abouttomorrow's slog.like almost all the athletes run tomorrow, Brace be a professionalrunner who specialise in marathons. He take an objective, long-term viewof his profession. As an income-earner, marathon running be an activity withliabilities and limitations, and require business management as well asphysical ability.the winner of the London marathon earn a tidy Dollars 50,000 and the NewYork, Boston and japanese runs be all in the same prize-winning category.but these and less financially-rewarding events be physically debilitating,and can only be win if a competitor be in top physical shape.with their careers and financial prospects in mind, top-level runnersnormally only run two marathons a year. As Brace says, when you have onlytwo pay-days out of 365, you choose, plan and train for them with greatcare.brace trains extremely carefully indeed. 'running a marathon be the easypart,' he says. 'The hard part be the lead-up to achieve the performancelevel required.' He start train three months before an event by running80 miles a week and then build progressively. For the last six weeks heruns 120 miles a week.normally he would hope that such a routine bring a pay-off. But the Olympicmarathon be an exception: the only top-level marathon that carry no prizemoney. Brace say that in spite of the prestige and possible financialspin-offs involved, 'it do not necessarily make sense to run to win.'given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preservephysical condition for races that do bring in money, he says, many runnerswill give less than their best effort.nonetheless, there be plenty whose considerations stretch beyond the purelyfinancial. italian Gelindo Bordin, who come first in the 1988 Seoul Olympicmarathon, be a strong contender. So be Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who camethird in Seoul. Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi of Japan arealso possible winners.none of them, though, will make a molehill out of the steep and formidableascent of Montjuic.A crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here March 1 to run 26 miles, 385 yards. And cheer every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees. Makers of cars, soda pop, sportswear, copiers, computers -- even a hospital -- have tag their names to the Los Angeles Marathon. In the promoter's words, this run be ""a market event on legs,"" reflect marathoning's grow importance in upscale product promotions. Runners, it seems, be a well-heeled lot. A study by Mercedes-Benz find that 42% of family heads make $40,000 a year or more jog regularly. Of potential buyers show up at Mercedes dealers, 47% be joggers. With those numbers in mind, the car maker have become a sponsor of three marathons -- in New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- as well as other run races. Marathons have have corporate backing for some time. But Los Angeles be ahead of the pack in make distance run a commercial spectacle. The city that invent the corporate-sponsored Olympics have create a marathon unlike others -- artfully dress as an olympic-type amateur race, but build from the ground up to make money for the closely hold company that control it -- as well as for the city. ""I take air and make an event,"" say William Burke, the founder and president of Los Angeles Marathon Inc. For a man whose running days end with his high school track team, Mr. Burke be turn a lot of heads in the world of marathoning. last year, its first time out, the Los Angeles race attract nearly 11,000 runners -- four times the number forecast and enough to make it the third -- large race in the U.S. The event also pull in about $4 million in cash and services from its sponsors, leave the organizers with $370,000 in red ink. This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect to gross about $5 million in cash and services and to break even. Next year, they say, a profit be possible. more than 18,000 runners be expect this year. An audience of perhaps a million and a half or more will line the route, drawn in part by advertisements on 75 million coca-cola cans and 2,500 billboards around the Los Angeles area. market experts say the festive atmosphere of big crowd in the streets make marathons attractive to sponsors. For the cost of a 30-second ad on the Super Bowl, a company can sponsor a marathon and ""take over a city,"" say Lesa Ukman, editor of special Events reports, a chicago-based newsletter. The Los Angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps do more than their counterparts elsewhere to publicize the event. Los Angelenos be see plugs for the race on millions of grocery bags, milk cartons and loaves of bread, in addition to soda cans, billboards and other sources. The venerable New York Marathon be take note. The New York Road Runners Club, organizer of the race, stop promote the event some years ago because it have all the runners it wanted. Now, Fred Lebow, the group's president, say he be encourage sponsors to promote the race as the Los Angeles sponsors do. The promotion in Los Angeles be unabashed. ""We tell people that if they're look for a new way to crack the Los Angeles market, this be it,"" say Mr. Burke. The pitch have attract the likes of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles; Vons Cos., a large supermarket chain; the Los Angeles Times; the Sears Savings Bank unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc. One supporter be Ellesse USA, a sportswear and shoe producer. A $50,000 fee enable the company to use the marathon's name in its ads; Ellesse will spend an additional $100,000 dress race personnel in T-shirts and warm-up suits, show its clothes at the marathon's public ""expo"" of sponsors' wares, and post a dozen big street banners along the course. The company have rent more than 500 billboards at a cut-rate price of $120,000 from Patrick Media Group, a marathon sponsor. The discount, about 50%, be important. ""we couldn't have buy that kind of exposure normally,"" say Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director. Ellesse, which also sponsor the New York run, find the West Coast event more freewheeling. ""They have let us do whatever we want,"" say Ms. Cialone. For instance, product banners along the route -- almost impossible to arrange in New York -- be a snap in Los Angeles. The city, in fact, be a partner in the race. After competitive bidding, it award an eight-year contract to Los Angeles Marathon Inc. to put on the race. The exclusive franchise call for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum $60,000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipts to the city. The organizers also will pay the cost of city services for the marathon, estimate at $100,000. The race sponsors and city officials be trade freely on the good will generate by Los Angeles's role as host of the 1984 Olympics. The logo of the marathon be a shield with laurel wreath. Some posters show the Los Angeles Coliseum with its torch and giant Olympic symbol. ""The World Returns to Los Angeles,"" proclaim one Mercedes-Benz ad. Race directors be call ""commissioners,"" a term borrow from the 1984 Olympic organization, in which Mr. Burke be commissioner of tennis. And like the Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portray the race as a civic celebration, thrives on volunteers. Some 7,500 people will work for free to monitor the course on race day. And two-thirds of the race's office staff work without pay. ""i couldn't buy this,"" Mr. Burke says, gesture around the crowded race headquarters. not everyone work for free. Big-name runners, for instance, want to be pay a lot. And here, the organizers have pinch pennies. While some runners will be pay to appear, this year's field, like last year's, lack some of the superstars who race in Boston, New York and London. Grete Waitz, one of the best woman marathoners, want $100,000 to appear in Los Angeles; she be turn down. Mr. Burke say the australian runner Rob de Castella make it known through his agent that he wouldn't run any marathons in the spring but, for $25,000, he'd be happy to say the Los Angeles event be tempting. Mr. Burke say he slam down the phone. ""we won't spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners,"" he says. Mr. de Castella's agent deny the story entirely. What Los Angeles lack in superstars, it plan to make up for in numbers. This year's race may challenge New York and London as the large marathon ever run. Some 20,500 start the New York race last year. Mr. Lebow, organizer of the New York event, say next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number. For one sponsor, this may be a mixed blessing. Orthopaedic Hospital, a not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship be part of a publicity campaign, provide emergency care stations along the marathon route. last year, one of every 20 runners need aid. Along with sprains, strains and blisters come more serious cases of exhaustion and hypothermia. A spokeswoman says: ""We advise 250 people to quit the race.""the Olympic trials, schedule for January, have make Nichols' job mucheasier this year. most top-ranked U.S. women be look for any summer-timemarathon in which to run and the San Francisco version offers excellentconditions.; The hills of San Francisco make this marathon challenging. Theweather, however, make it one of the few enticing races hold from June toseptember. early morning temperatures range in the low 50s in late June.;""This be the only place in the world where you can have a marathon in themiddle of summer,"" Nichols said.; Defending champ back; last year'swinner, Janis Klecker of Minnetonka, Minn., be entered. The field also boastsjanine Aiello of Albuquerque, N.M.; Michelle Bush-Cuke of Berrien Springs,Mich.; Christine Gibbons of Elmwood, N.J.; Lesley Lahane of Chestnut Hills,Mass.; Julie Shea-Graw of Raleigh, N.C., and Jane Welzel of Fort Collins,Colo.; All seven women have run marathons under the 2-hour, 40-minutebarrier. Klecker turn in a 2:39:52 on the 26.2-mile course.; Welzel isthe 1990 national champion, Gibbons have win 26 marathons, Lahane be a formercross-country national champion and Aiello twice have finish second in SanFrancisco.; A test for Shea-Graw; Shea-Graw, 32, finish third in the 1981New York City Marathon and be consistently rank among the top five Americanrunners throughout most of the early '80s. She be the top qualifier for the1980 Olympics team that miss the Moscow Summer Games because of a U.S.boycott.; This will be Shea-Graw's first race outside of North Carolinasince 1986, when she take time off to have a child.; ""i've run some localraces,"" shea-graw said. ""this be go to be a test for me. If it go well,then I'll up the ante and give my train the time that be need to becomecompetitive again.""; Shea-Graw's best time be 2:30:11.; ""i have somemajor injuries and want to have a child,"" shea-graw said. ""but now it's timeto get on with my career.""mr. Kelley be in train for the Boston Marathon -- his60th Boston Marathon. And even at the age of 83, he probablywill finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runnersexpected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April15.Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plansto run again this year, marvels at Mr. Kelley: ""it'sincomprehensible that a man his age be do what he's doing.i'm struggle at the age of 43. . . . This isn't golf.""even the thought of run a course of 26 miles and 385yards leave some of Mr. Kelley's rival of yesteryeargasping. ""aghast be more like it,"" say Leslie Pawson, 86, athree-time Boston champion who run against Mr. Kelley half acentury ago. ""My doctor says: `No running, whatsoever.' Ican't even remember when I run my last marathon.""john Adelbert Kelley be a throwback to a time whenmarathoners do it for glory and cab fare. A two-time winnerin Boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, Mr.Kelley be to be the old competitor in the race this year-- as he have be for 15 years.mr. Kelley be such an institution that Hopkinton, Mass.,where the race begins, have make him an honorary citizen.(""that mean I don't have to pay taxes there,"" he jokes.) Twostate troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr.Kelley into Boston so he won't be trample by ""groupies,"" ashe call them, clamor to shake his hand. last year, fivejapanese runners be wave away by the bodyguards, as theysidled up to the old celebrity during the race. Recalls SuniTomomitsu, one of the runners: ""At first we thought, `oh,wow, he's like Mafia man.' then we said, `oh no, this be nicejohnny Kelley.' In Japan, he be awesome.""Though he isn't the old person ever to enter the BostonMarathon, Mr. Kelley be the old to run it. Peter Foley,who be bear in 1859, be a regular until he be well intohis 80s. But he walk the course. start at dawn (sixhours before the official noon start), Mr. Foley wouldeventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight.of course, Mr. Kelley -- not to be confuse with the otherjohn Kelley, who win the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn't therunner he be in 1935 when he win the race, in 2 hours, 32minutes, 7 seconds. His best time ever be in 1945: 2 hours,30 minutes, 40 seconds. last year he finish in 5 hours, 5minutes. He hop to do good in 1991. ""That's not aprediction, just a goal,"" he says.when John Kelley first toe the line in 1928, George Bushwasn't yet in kindergarten, Joe DiMaggio be an unknown andnike be the winged goddess of victory, not a running shoe.in those days, Mr. Kelley recalls, he run in black leatherhigh-jumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razorblade. ""i would have love to run with the bad pair ofsneakers on the market today,"" he says.back then, the sport didn't have much of a following.today, of course, the Boston Marathon be a big deal, coveredby tv from start to finish and offer $402,000 altogetherin prize money.""the winners get a medal and $55,000,"" say Mr. Kelley. ""igot a medal and beef stew. God bless them,"" he adds. ""theydeserve it.""the rosy-cheeked, supple Mr. Kelley be a medical wonder.each year, he visit the Cooper Clinic at the Aerobics Centerin Dallas for a battery of endurance tests. ""physiologically,whatever that means, I get all A's,"" Mr. Kelley report ofhis checkup four months ago.""What that means,"" explain Kenneth Cooper, the physicianwho write ""Aerobics"" and several sequels and be now at workon a book on elderly athletes, ""is that Johnny have the bodyof a man 23 years younger. He's go to be one of the starsof my book."" Mr. Kelley's rest pulse rate -- 60 beats aminute -- be well below the average person's 72 beats.(that's good.) On the stress test the clinic gives, Mr.Kelley hold the endurance record for his age group.a mechanic for Boston Edison Co. before he retire in1972, Mr. Kelley start run in the evenings after workmore than six decades ago. His only purpose be to relax andhave some fun. ""all day long, I do what my bos tell me todo,"" he recalls. ""but when I run at night, I felt free. I rantill I be exhausted.""in 1928, when he be 21, he enter his first BostonMarathon but didn't finish. He drop out three-quarters ofthe way through the race. Then, in 1933, he finish 37th ina field of about 200 runners. In all the years since, he hasmissed the race just once, in 1967. (he have competed, alltold, in 112 marathons, include the 1936 and 1948 Olympics.Mr. Kelley well know the jagged course from Hopkinton todowntown Boston:The first challenge come five miles into the race, wherea set of little hills can get a psyched runner to wasteenergy charge up the slopes. A mile and a half later,there's new reason to beware: The smells of Cavanaugh'sBakery can set off hunger pangs.an Exxon station in Wellesley marks the halfway point. Asteep descent into Newton Lower Falls can jar a tiredrunner's bones. Then, at the end of a long column of oak andmaple trees, be Heartbreak Hill, his nemesis. It cost him atleast two victories, he says. And finally there's the HauntedMile, a stretch where many runners have collapsed. Boston'sskyline, 2 1/2 miles in the distance, can seem so far away.Though still go strong, Mr. Kelley acknowledge themarathon get tough each year. To compensate, he trainsharder. He use to start prepare in earnest at the end ofjanuary. ""In recent years, I've be in train 12 months ayear,"" he says, though the serious stuff -- a daily one-hourrun, sprints on the track and long, 2 1/2-hour runs everyother week -- begin in December. (He doesn't count the mileshe put in, as many long-distance runners obsessively do, buthe say he wouldn't object to an estimate of about 50 miles aweek.)mr. Kelley always train at 5 a.m., and alone: ""It's aquiet time, no traffic; the air be fresh and sweet."" Hisroutes vary. In January, he prefer the frozen sands of thebeach. With the approach of spring, he take to the alder andscrub-pine hills and bluffs where the sun can be see risingover Cape Cod Bay. After his morning run, he spend a coupleof hours paint (still life and Cape Cod scenes), a hobbyhe take up about 25 years ago.unlike many runners, Mr. Kelley doesn't bother withstretching exercises before he run in the morning. ""This ismy warm up: I empty the dishwasher, I set up the coffeepot,but I don't plug it in. I set up the breakfast table. then Icheck the outside temperature to see what clothe to wear.""he and his wife, Laura, live in a two-bedroom ranch-stylehouse here in East Dennis, with more than 350 trophies,medals and sweat-stained marathon numbers scatter about. Heisn't particular about brands of shoes (""i wear them all"") orwhat he eat (""i never eat broccoli, but I love steak and icecream."")mr. Kelley aims to run till he be at least 100 years old.""he's a strange man,"" say Laura Kelley, in awe of herhusband's vigor.

He be theepitome of that.at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens capture four goldmedals in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and400-meter relay.the Berlin Games be to be the showcase of Hitler's theorieson the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kidshowed up, Bush said. It be an unrivaled athletic triumph. Butmore than that, it really be a triumph for all humanity.bush, borrow a phrase from Ruth Owens, say it be not thoseathletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race oflife that earn Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.Owens devote himself to work with youth and serving as aspecial ambassador for sports, say Bush. He say the athlete'slegacy live on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playgroundolympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletesand the Jesse Owens Foundation, which award scholarships to needyyouth.despite the many honors, his great satisfaction come fromhis work with youth, say Mrs. Owens, 74.attending the ceremony along with Owens' family be formerOlympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; formerteammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and twoohio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, whospearheaded the drive to strike the medal.the silver-haired Mrs. Owens, stand outside the White Houseafterwards, call the event absolutely beautiful. She added:i'm sure with the sun shin straight down, Jesse's watch us,too.the 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't even over when advertisers begin clamor for pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton. She go on to grin relentlessly through some $5 million worth of commercial endorsements -- surely an olympic record in itself. But when the 1988 Summer Games end Sunday night, so, too, do the chance for american athletes to follow in her footsteps. Ad agency executives, who spend every fourth year glue to their tv sets, hop to pick out the next star to hawk their clients' products, say that this Olympiad be a dud. ""i suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the Olympics,"" say Jerry Della Femina, chairman of ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS. ""This be the first Olympics without passion, and without passion you don't have testimonials. Without heroes, you don't have anyone that anyone want to emulate."" On the surface, the Games seem to offer all the drama that usually make for lucrative endorsement contracts. Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smack his head on the springboard, then come back to win two gold medals? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, her two-inch fingernails rake the air as she win the 100-meter sprint? But even these two, along with Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who win the women's heptathalon and the long jump, may find it more difficult than in previous years to turn gold medals into gold in the bank. The fact is, say many marketers, Olympic gold have lose much of its commercial luster. ""i don't think it's big money like it use to be,"" say Michael Goldberg of National Media Group Inc., the New York sports-marketing firm that represent Ms. Retton. ""It use to be kind of a knee-jerk reaction to do an ad campaign around an Olympic athlete. It just doesn't happen anymore."" Certainly, this year's win Olympians will have no trouble secure contracts from specialize sports-equipment outfitters and speak invitations from obscure trade groups. But the major, high-paying endorsements -- such as those with soft-drink companies and fast-food outlets -- just don't seem to be surfacing, at least not yet. Earlier this year, sports marketers estimate that a gold medal win during the Summer Games could earn a personable athlete more than $1 million in endorsements. Now, marketers say, these medalists will be lucky to pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year. Advertisers can reel off a litany of reasons why these Olympics aren't ignite much spark. For one thing, they suffer by comparison with the 1984 Summer Games, so exciting because they be hold in Los Angeles and because, in the absence of boycott Soviet-bloc countries, the Americans win 83 gold medals. The 1988 Games, by contrast, be broadcast from halfway around the world, and the Soviets trounce the Americans, 55 gold medals to 36. What's more, marketers say, this year's drug scandals cast a pall over the Games, especially the incident involve canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who lose his gold medal after test positive for steroids. NBC's tv coverage also get its share of the blame. Marketers say it be so bland and skip so frequently from one event to another that there be little chance for excitement to build. The constant commercial interruptions, which lead to ratings that be much low than expected, didn't help, either. During most of the past Games, ""there be enough continuous tv coverage so that, much like a soap opera, it be possible to get involve in the lives and in the competition,"" say Leigh Steinberg, attorney for ice-skater Brian Boitano, a gold medalist at the 1988 Winter Games. But not this summer, he says. recent changes in Olympic rules, meanwhile, have lead to a glut of Olympians in search of endorsement deals. Before the 1984 Games, most Olympic athletes weren't allow to make commercials unless they give up their amateur status. Now, they can appear in as many ads as they want, but the income must go into a trust fund for train expenses. ""every year, more and more olympic people be out there want to do commercials -- basically, everybody be available,"" say Daisy Sinclair, a vice president with ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As a result, while once an ""aura"" surround an Olympian, now ""the bloom be off."" Companies also be become more sophisticated in their approach to celebrity endorsements. Increasingly cost conscious, they will no longer hook up with an olympian just because the company president like the athlete's sport. And after years of pay big bucks to Olympic star only to see them fade into obscurity, companies have finally get the hint that olympian fame be of the most fleeting variety. ""if you think your phone will ring off the hook if (you win) a gold medal, it isn't go to happen anymore,"" say Stephen Disson, senior vice president of marketing for ProServ Inc., a Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies now know that ""six months from now there will be other heroes from other sport events"" for them to consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude toward the Olympics be become typical. It use sports stars in its commercials for Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds but have no plans to call on any of 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer to use athletes who be in the public eye on a regular basis, like football and basketball players,"" say Charles Miesmer, the agency's executive creative director. ""People like Michael Jordan have 10-plus years in their sports careers, all in a row, so I don't have to worry about the public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And don't look for any of 1988's winners to start show up on Wheaties boxes, either. General Mills Inc., which have feature Ms. Retton and decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner on its Wheaties boxes in the past, say it look for three qualities in an endorser: career achievement, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishments. A spokeswoman say that none of this year's crop meet all three criteria. so far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee have have the most visible endorsements. even before the Olympics began, she have make commercials for Primatene mist and 7-up. And, accord to her agent, Pearl Hodge of World Class Management, she be now ""in the process"" of sign with McDonald's Corp., to work on behalf of its efforts to aid underprivileged children. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take the endorsement lead. Advertisers say with her good looks and fashion flare, she be attract more interest than any of the other medal winners. (The sprinter's manager couldn't be reach for comment.) Another olympian with endorsement potential be swimmer Matt Biondi, who win five gold medals. Mr. Biondi have already sign a swim-wear contract with Arena USA Inc., and Parkes Brittain, his agent at Advantage International Inc., say his client ""will definitely be in a high-income ring, the high you can name."" then there be Mr. Louganis. Since win two gold medals during the 1984 Summer Olympics, the diver have have little luck with major endorsements. And a few marketing executives say that even his second sweep of the diving events may not up his potential. ""when most advertisers be look for the male hero, the word 'macho' trails along very closely,"" say Marty Blackman of Blackman & Raber, a sports-marketing firm in New York. ""I don't find Louganis a macho guy."" Still, other marketing professionals say that Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery after smash his head have secure the diver's future. His manager, Jim Babbitt, won't comment on any contract offers. He will say, however, that his client have ""done just fine. He isn't unhappy. He dive to perform; he doesn't dive for dollars."" ---winning EndorsementsThere be only one former olympian among the top sports endorsers of last year.athlete: Arnold Palmer (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Hertz, PaineWebber, Pennzoil, United Airlines, GTE, Toro, Loft Seed Co., Sears, Pro Group, Robert Bruce, Westin HotelsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $8 millionathlete: Jack Nicklaus (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Bostonian Shoe Co., Hart Schaffner & Marx, Optique Du Monde, Pine Hosiery Mills, WarnacoESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Boris Becker (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Coca-Cola, Deutsche Bank, Polaroid, UNICEFESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionathlete: Greg Norman (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Reebok, Spalding, Epson Computers, Hertz, Qantas Airlines, Daikyo Group, Swan Lager & Castlemaine, Akubia HatsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4.5 millionathlete: Michael Jordan (Basketball, 1984 Olympian)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Nike, Wilson, Excelsior, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Johnson Products, Ohio ArtESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4 millionathlete: Ivan Lendl (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Gleneagles Country Club, Avis, Seiko, Adidas, Bow Brand StringsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionathlete: John Madden (Former football coach)national ENDORSEMENTS: Ace Hardware, Miller Lite, Ramada, Exxon, Canon, GreyhoundESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionathlete: Jim McMahon (Football)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Taco Bell, Kraft Foods, Ebel Watches, Honda, Adidas, LJN Toys, Revo SunglassesESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionathlete: Dennis Conner (Yachting)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Rayban, Sperry Topsider, Wrigley's, Disney, Lacoste, Pepsi-ColaESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Chris Evert (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Lipton Iced Tea, Wilson Converse, Ellesse, Polo Club of Boca Raton, Rolex, Evert Active Life Skin Care, Marchon Sunwear for EllesseESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Martina Navratilova (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Lufthansa Airlines, Vuarnet, DHL, Sugar-Free Jello, Aspen Club, RKO Video, World Tennis MagazineESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionathlete: Jackie Stewart (retired race car driver)national ENDORSEMENTS: Ford, Goodyear, USF&G, Rolex, Gleneagles, American Express, British Telecom, ICCIESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionsource: Sports Marketing NewsletterDebi Thomas' dream of Olympic goldturned into disappointment Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Wittwon her second straight Olympic championship and canadian ElizabethManley take home the silver before a crowd of cheer countrymen.it's over.

Tonight it be nation versus nation.What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event isthat at the Olympics the race have traditionally go to affluent countries -or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resources on athletes.the US have comfortably win the most relay medals, follow by Britain, theformer Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even count the six wonbefore 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.Britain alone have win more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands(nine) and Africa (four, include one for South Africa). The Dutch, withone, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and SouthAmerica (nil) combined. The Cuban women's 100 metres relay teams of 1968 and1972 be the only women from outside the developed world to have win relaymedals.with a little luck - with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relaysalways require a little luck - the develop countries will continue thegentle redistribution of medals.

In the 4x100m heats James Jett replace Carl Lewis but Lewisran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue hiseighth Olympic gold.one thing that become clear on Thursday, when Lewis win his seventh goldwith victory in the long jump, be that while win at the Olympics maybring other athletes excitement or relief, Lewis simply adore theexperience.when Voula Patoulidou, look up at the giant video screen after thewomen's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that shehad win a gold medal, she go delightfully and utterly potty, as do theother 25 Greeks in the stadium, include Queen Sofia of Spain.Lewis, on the other hand, seem unsurprised when Mike Powell be unable tooverhaul him in the long jump. even though the long jump have not finishedand even though 5,000m runners be trudge through a semi-final, Lewisbegan at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour.he try to orchestrate a mexican wave.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing groupof runners in those events.In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured manysuccessful Olympic athletes.",,,,

The strike continue at these mines on 28 June. Some of the miners at the Karl Marx, ""Chernovonyy Zhovten,"" ""Chervonyy Profinter,"" and ""Yunkom"" pits join the strike. A total of 1,200 of the association's 2,248 workers be on strike. A rally consist of 350 miners be hold on 28 June near the town council building where demands be make to pay the wages and dismiss the director general of the ""ordzhonikidzevuhillya"" production association.a strike committee consist of 12 persons be elect (one of the members be a former Komsomol leader and former USSR people's deputy Viktor Honcharov) and it be decide to continue the strike until the demands that have be raise have be completely fulfilled.on 28 June, 118 of 258 workers on the second shift at the ""PivdennoDonbass"" mine of the ""Donetskvuhillya"" production association in the town of Ugledar refuse to start work for the same reasons -- delay in pay wages. After a meeting with the mine's director, who promise to pay the arrears, the miners on the third shift return to work.on 27 June, all miners on the fourth shift at the ""karbomid"" and ""pervomaysk"" mines in Pervomaysk, Lugansk oblast, refuse to start work (142 and 157 miners respectively).in the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wish not to be identified, the strike have a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the exist authorities and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential elections. accord to some reports, among the leaders of the striking pits there be members of the Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Bloc of Reforms.As Kostyantyn Fesenko, chairman of the coal industry workers trade union, inform a UNIAN correspondent, Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, in a telephone conversation on 29 June, give assurances that the money for the miners' wages as well as subsidies for the following month would be find and forward in the next few days.the National Union of Mineworkers say an estimate 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for high wages and good work conditions, in what it say would be the large job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation. The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africa's gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines, say Cyril Ramaphosa, the union's general secretary. If workers in mines not include in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes, a total of 300,000 miners could be on strike, he said. Gold and coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign-currency earnings. The union's announcement produce little immediate reaction on south african financial markets, where analysts say a strike have be expect and probably wouldn't have much impact unless it last more than a month. Mine owners reportedly have be build stockpiles for several weeks in anticipation of a strike. Mining companies' shares rise along with the price of gold, but the metal's rise come mainly in reaction to increase tensions in the persian Gulf. The South african rand be slightly firmer. Mr. Ramaphosa say the union be demand a 30%, across-the-board wage increase for black miners, who the union say earn an average of 225 rand ($109) a month. The Chamber of Mines, which represent the nation's six big mining houses, say black miners earn about twice that much. It implement wage increases range from 15% to 23.4% last month. Anglo American Corp., the huge South African mining house, warn against a strike, say miners have receive a good wage increase in July and wouldn't gain further raises by a job action. But ""at this stage it seem the strike seem inevitable,"" say Mr. Ramaphosa, who add that there hadn't be any negotiations with management since a strike ballot receive ""overwhelming support"" during the week of July 12. He also warn of possible confrontations with police, saying: ""We have issue instructions to our members that if they be attack they should defend themselves."" Miners' strikes in recent years have feature clashes with police, leave dozens of people dead. ""the total mines that will be affect be 28 gold mines around the country and 18 collieries,"" the union official said. ""Our union be at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies, where strike action could take place at any time, should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members' demands."" He say such other companies include De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's large diamond miner. In addition to the general wage increase, Mr. Ramaphosa say the union be demand pay for black miners do dangerous work. The black miners also be ask for 30 days' leave each year, and a pay holiday on June 16, the anniversary of the 1976 Soweto riots.

Further increases could only come if the government easedprohibitive wage control taxes, thus provide a powerful precedent for wagedemands by other groups.meanwhile coal mining unions be also demand wage increases as well as aclear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scatteredstoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises thatcash strap managements can ill afford.in contrast to the copper industry, which continue to show a profit, coalmining be run at a loss with subsidies stop in March as thegovernment move to control the budget deficit. The industry be experiencinga coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amount to some12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output.this have lead to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and ledto the present bout of unrest. polish mines produce 69.7m tonnes of coal inthe first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period lastyear. meanwhile KGHM produce 197,000 tonnes of refined copper in the sameperiod or 3.9 per cent more than in the first half of 1991.Coal miners in Siberia end theirstrike today after exact promises of good food, housing andworking conditions, but the wave of unrest they launch continuedin other key coal regions.some of the 150,000 miners who go on strike last week insiberia's Kuznetsk coal basin region return to work Thursday, andthe rest go back today, strike leaders and the official Tass newsagency said.despite announcements that President Mikhail S.

Menayev, an engineer at thetaldinski Severny open pit mine on the outskirts of Prokopyevsk.Strike committee member Vyacheslav G.

Tens of thousands of miners walk off the job for twohours Wednesday.Tass say that in Donetsk the miners gather in front of thehouse of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline forimplementing reforms.COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearhead violent anti-reformrampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, be once again out on strike,pressing the government for high wages.but so far the government, unlike its predecessors, have not cave in. It hasinstead begin legal action to have the strike, which today enter itssecond week, declare illegal.the miners' position seem untenable. Romanians appear solidly oppose tothe strike, anger by the miners' demand for an average wage of theequivalent of Dollars 290 a month. most workers earn less than Dollars 80.Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignoredappeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.the Ministry of Industry argue that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produce eachyear in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines be not a vital source of energy. Theregion's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, whichtogether account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity,could also be run use lignite and gas.the ministry far argue that the miners be in danger of price theircoal out of the market. accord to the ministry, if the miners' paydemands be met, the cost of their coal would double. even at presentprices, ukrainian coal be be import to the romanian market.the strike seem motivate by a number of factors. The rank and file havecome out because they want more money to compensate for the difficultconditions in which they live and work.They be also follow the call of their charismatic leader, Mr MironCosma, the man who lead them on protests to Bucharest and secure theirearlier wage increases.mr Cosma's motive for call the strike - for which, surprisingly, he hasthe support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - be less obvious.the ministries of industry and finance be conduct investigations intocharges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH companyofficials. The company's chief accountant and budget director have alreadybeen fired, follow early investigations.ministry of Industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt todivert attention from the investigations.mr Cosma, however, appear confident. One of his bargaining tools be thethreat, albeit veiled, of fresh violence.in response to the question as to whether he intend to lead his men, whoappear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: 'Withminers, anything be possible.'But he be also make political threats. In recent months, Mr Cosma hasclaimed he have evidence that senior government officials, includingpresident Ion Iliescu, call miners to Bucharest as part of plans toconsolidate their own power.mr Cosma appear increasingly willing to talk if his demands be not met. Itremains to be see whether those involve in the incidents of 1990 and 1991now feel confident enough to ignore him.port workers in Szczecin andsouthwestern coal miners today declare sympathy strikes withminers demand the l ","AP880816-0135,AP890616-0230,FBIS4-42027,WSJ870804-0095,AP890720-0075,AP890719-0248,SJMN91-06069108,FT923-12122,AP890721-0091,AP891103-0200,FT933-9536,AP880817-0124",Coal miners strike in major coal regions around the world.,"Major strikes, mostly by coal miners seeking higher wages, seriously disrupted industries throughout the world from 1987 to 1994 in South Africa, Poland, Romania, the Ukraine, Siberia and Central Asia in the Soviet Union.

John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapons officer, say the gunswere thoroughly inspect the morning of the accident, and Moosallysaid he have no hesitation about the guns' safety.i'll be in the turret for the first shot to go off, thecaptain said.one of the survivors, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt,21, of Tampa, Fla., say that at first the men down in the powdermagazine in the low level of the turret didn't know anything waswrong.We be wait for the gun to fire, and we weren't sure, hesaid. When the men discover that no one be answer theinterior turret communications link, Truitt order the powderreturned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated.the sailors find smoke everywhere as they climb throughhatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck,truitt recalled.my first think be that I'd well get to a lifeboatstation, because if the fire get to the magazine things would bebad, he said.navy investigators will be look at allpossibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort todetermine what cause the explosion that kill 47 aboard thebattleship USS Iowa, officials say.it could take months before the probe be complete and theresults release publicly, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Alan Dooleysaid Sunday.A seven-member team of investigators board the battleship aday after the explosion flash through the Iowa's no. 2 gun turreton Wednesday.They're look at any evidence of human error or mechanicalerror, or anything technical, say Lt. Janet Mescus, aspokeswoman at the Navy's information center at Norfolk, Va., theship's home port. The Iowa return to Norfolk on Sunday.They're move as quickly as they can, Lt. Mescus said, butadded, They want to be thorough and that take time.dooley say the investigation would be fairly complexbecause there be no witnesses. There be 11 survivors inside theturret, all on the low deck load powder from the ship'smagazines, the Navy said.dooley say no information would be release until the probe iscompleted, and the Navy have refuse to speculate on the cause ofthe explosion, which damage only the inside of the turret.but The New York Times report Sunday that Navy teams whoentered the turret immediately after the blast find the no. 2gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile thatthe gun be to have fire still there.the Times cite unidentified sources as say this indicatedthe explosion occur while the bags contain 550 pounds ofpropellant powder be still be load into the gun.navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occur when thebags be be transfer from a powder hoist to the gun, thenewspaper said. They say flame and hot gases from the blast wentdown the hoist to the low deck; if the transfer of powder to theguns have be complete, the hoist would have be seal off.the Navy on Sunday release an amateur videotape of theexplosion, which be make by an officer on the bridge of the Iowawho want to record the firing of the guns.the investigation team be head by Rear Adm. Richard D.Milligan, former command officer of the battleship USS NewJersey, and it also include experts on gunnery and weapons.the 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa, which can loba shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles, have an outdateddesign that be unfit in the nuclear missile age, critics say.they're old-fashioned and inherently dangerous. They all oughtto be eliminated, retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Centerfor Defense Information say Thursday. I don't know what more ittakes to get people to recognize this ancient technology be nolonger appropriate on warships.But the Navy defend the 16-inch gun, the mighty in use onany ocean, after an explosion kill 47 sailors Wednesday aboardthe battleship Iowa while a turret crew load gunpowder for targetpractice.this gun ... remain the fine naval gun in the world. It wasthe pinnacle of gun design art, and it be still a front-linesystem, say Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander of the Iowa untillast May.The main criticism be that the big gun require gunpowder packedin silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-longbarrel. It work like the breech-loaded guns that roar during thecivil War: A shell be place into a barrel and then charge withgunpowder in a separate package.in the Iowa's case, 660 pounds of powder six 110-pound bags be need to fire a projectile weigh up to 2,700 pounds at aspeed of 2,500 feet per second. An electric spark ignite thepowder.the extremely flammable silk be suppose to burn away during theburst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases canbuild up in the barrel. Air pressurize to 3,000 pounds per squareinch can be blow into the breech to clear away debris to guardagainst a blowback, which happen when powder ignite beforethe breech be closed.in new guns, powder be pack in metal containers. Missiles,the backbone of the modern Navy's attack capability, haveintegrated propellants.capt. James Bush of the Center for Defense Information, aprivate think tank often critical of Pentagon policy, say the Iowaexplosion could have be cause by smolder debris, a blowbackor a mishap in the handling of powder.it wasn't unexpected. It wasn't a surprise. This be dangeroustechnology. It's archaic, Bush said. These be the only gun inthe Navy that still use bag powder.the Navy say Thursday that none of the guns in the Iowa turrethad be fire before the explosion take place.the Navy also on Thursday place a moratorium on fire the bigguns, find only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, thenew Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.In a large sense, critics say the battleships themselves, oncethe mainstay of gunboat diplomacy, have outlive their purpose.despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, the battlewagons arevulnerable to submarine and missile attack. The 20-mile range ofthe 16-inch gun be almost worthless in an era when missiles can befired at much great distances.we can do almost anything with a missile and do it better,bush said.Battleships reach their heyday in World War I and wereintended to fight other ships.the Iowa, first launch in 1942, be the first of an entireclass of U.S. battlewagons build to conquer Japan.It support Marine amphibious landings and shell shoretargets, but the aircraft carrier emerge as the Navy's top weaponbecause naval battles be wag without ships ever see eachother. The Iowa also fight off Korea.The Iowa and three sister warships be order out of mothballsin the Reagan administration's military buildup six years ago. Theywere upgrade with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 20mm guns and Harpoonmissiles.One of the battleships, the New Jersey, bombard syrian anddruze positions in Lebanon as part the U.S. peacekeeping role in1983. But the 16-inch guns often miss their targets, which thenavy blame on unreliable powder from World War II.There be no military need to return these ships to activeduty, say the CDI's LaRocque. Their only military utility isto bombard Third World countries, and the era of gunboat diplomacyis over.the scar battleship USS Iowa make asomber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 familymembers and friends of the crew welcome love ones who escape anexplosion that kill 47 sailors.Sailors in whites with black arm bands line the rails as thehuge vessel dock at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m.,just one minute later than Navy officials have estimated. Twentyminutes later, families start file aboard the ship, exchangingtearful embraces with the return sailors.they want to get here on schedule and be anxious to gethome, say Capt. Steven Karalekas.The explosion Wednesday flash through the Iowa's no. 2 gunturret, which extend six decks down into the ship. There be 11survivors inside the turret, all on the low deck load powderfrom the ship's magazines, the Navy said.two of the survive crewmen of no. 2 turret stood on top of thefire-blackened turret as the ship pull into the pier, with fullcrews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.the no. 2 turret be in the same position as when the explosionoccurred, face right with the left and right guns elevated. Thecenter gun, where the blast occurred, be depressed.when the 887-foot vessel first appear there be scatteredcheers by those on the dock, but all remain silent as the shippulled into the pier. The somber mood be heighten by the lack ofbands, and few waves be exchange as the ship docked.adm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet,was on the dock to greet the vessel. As it docked, three marinesraised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.the Navy keep the news media about 300 yards from the families,and reporters be not allow to talk with the families or thecrewmen.the violence and power of the turret explosion be show in anamateur videotape release by the Navy on Sunday. The tape be madeby an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who want to record thefiring of the big guns.the detonation, which appear to blast away the gasket-likerubber bloomers that seal the turret's gun slits, be followedby a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base ofthe gunhouse.the videotape cut immediately to damage control firefightersspraying heavy streams of water onto the turret.throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicate prayers sundaymorning to the families of Iowa crewmen.we have lose 47 of our number in a tragic way, say Cmdr.John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk NavalAir Station. Our faith help us to handle what science cannotanswer, the mystery of death.a red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a bookcontaining the names of the dead be take to the altar.fitzgerald say the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lostsoviet submarine put political differences aside and unite thehuman family as one.on Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial servicein a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.the families of the victims be invited, but Navy officialssaid they do not know how many would attend. none of the victimslisted the Norfolk area as their hometown.the explosion occur during exercises off Puerto Rico. ThePentagon say it happen before the middle 16-inch gun of thethree-gun turret have be fired.

The Senate Armed Services Committee will hold hearings on the explosion.","An explosion in the battleship Iowa's No.2 turret on Wednesday, April 19, 1989, during a training exercise NE of Puerto Rico, killed 47. Naval investigators concluded the explosion occurred while gunpowder was in transit from a powder hoist. Crew in upper turret chambers died instantly in the explosion and fire while those at lower levels suffocated as the blast sucked out oxygen. Eleven escaped from powder magazines at the turret's base. On Sunday, 3000 family and friends welcomed the Iowa home to Norfolk. Sailors with black arm bands lined the Iowa's rails and two surviving guncrew members stood on the blackened No.2 turret. On Monday, President Bush spoke to 8000 mourners at a memorial service and Iowa commander Capt. Fred Moosally praised the victims. A moratorium was placed on firing the 16-inch guns, which are criticized as outdated and dangerous, using gunpowder packed in silk bags that are rammed into a gun after the shell and ignited by electric spark. Newer guns' powder is packed in metal containers. Missiles have integrated propellants. The four WWII-era battleships came out of mothballs in 1982. Critics say they have outlived their purpose but the Navy disagrees and is keeping them in service. The Senate Armed Services Committee will hold hearings on the explosion.",,,,
35,d085d,"here be a chronology of Hurricane Hugo's destructive path acrossthe Caribbean into South Carolina:Residents take forecasters at their wordwhen they warn of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number ofdeaths from the powerful storm can be credit to this healthyrespect, authorities said.the storm, which cause billions in damage, claim 17 lives insouth Carolina, and only two be in the Charleston area, whichbore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.we just feel very thankful about that, say Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousands of people who be in the sheltersand the tens of thousands of people who evacuate inland werepotential victims of injury and death.riley and other officials credit residents with monitor thehurricane as it spin toward Charleston, and heed evacuationwarnings.the last big storm to hit South Carolina be Hurricane David in1979, which hit the coast after pound southern Florida.Since then several big storms have threaten but veered away,and officials be worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've have so many close calls, say Gary Garnet, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service.But this storm be very, very strong, he said. This timethey realize it.glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimate that 18,000residents in Charleston and the three surround counties headedfor shelters.Tens of thousands more get into their cars and head upinterstate 26 toward Columbia.Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related deaths, credit people for heed thewarnings.it be bad, but it could have be a lot worse, he said.you've just get to say nice things about the people.meanwhile, Garnet have some good news for storm-wearycharlestonians: late Saturday the tropics be quiet with no otherstorms brewing.there's nothing to worry about out there, he said.this historic city have survive theravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied300-year-history, but it face perhaps its great test of all inhurricane Hugo.The storm, pack winds of up to 135 mph, rag into CharlestonThursday night.This be a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which fewpeople who have live all their lives in Charleston haveexperienced, warn Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.Hugo be the first major hurricane to strike Charleston sincehurricane Gracie come ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.The seaside community have suffer through many disasters, bothnatural and man-made.the worst in recent decades be in 1938 when a tornado torethrough the city, kill 32 people, injure hundreds and causingan estimate $2 million in property damage.charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures liningquaint streets and alleyways, be where the Civil War begin in 1861.The city have survive the shot and shell of two wars and anynumber of small hurricanes, politely refer to by Charlestoniansof refinement as September gales.but the bad natural disaster to beset the city occur on thehot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumble in what somefolks think be a prelude to Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake be felt as far away as Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, theearthquake claim an estimate 110 lives, destroy 102 buildingsand toss most of the city's 14,000 chimney into the streets.in recent years, the city have attract millions of visitorsannually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby finesand beaches.charleston have receive international acclaim as home to SpoletoFestival U.S.A., found by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive artsfestival.supercomputers, satellites and the expertise ofseveral hurricane forecasters predict the destructive pathhurricane Hugo would follow, give people plenty of time to fleethe South Carolina coast.but hurricane track remain an uncertain science.Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center use computer modelsto track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions andforecasting changes in those conditions be embody in thosemodels, say Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall be difficult, butforecasters say Friday that the landfall be predict in time forevacuation.overall, I think the tracking models give us a very good ideawhere Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in atimely manner, say research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem with Hugo be predict theintensity of the storm, which be upgrade to a Category 4 hurricanejust hours before it slam into Charleston.It be very difficult to predict changes in intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer models for that, McAdie said.we really need to improve on our forecast ability of strength.the hurricane specialists be surprise by the last-minuteincrease in wind speed, which be report to them by Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who have track hurricanes for 35years, say that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting toolswere reports from aircraft or ships.we have no radar or satellites then, so needless to say ourforecasts be less accurate, Clark said.in the late 1960s, the weather service begin use satellites toobtain a global weather picture. information from the satellite isused to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models thattelevision viewers see every night.using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at thenational Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where a track model constantly change toaccount for current weather conditions and the position of thehurricane.to determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyzesupercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similarstorms and the current path of the hurricane.then they make an educated guess about the landfall.meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the MassachussettsInstitute of Technology criticize the current forecasting system.congress and the american people be suffer from thecollective delusion that our data problems have be solve bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enoughinformation about the wind and temperatures that affect ahurricane's path.most of the information actually use to predict hurricanescomes from fly airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures be improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have to remember that those models use be only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of theforecaster to predict the storm's path.hurricane Hugo strike South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents insoutheastern states grab what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.this be a disaster star us right in the eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. say from his City Hall command post in Charleston,where the hurricane down power lines, snap trees and causedutility transformers to explode.all we can do now be pray and hope all the precautions we havetaken have be sufficient, Riley say as Hugo's eye bore in onthe city. I just hope and pray we can get through this without anyloss of life.by midnight, 119 mph winds be report in Charleston. The roofcracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that haswithstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water pour into thepaneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the commandpost be knock out.hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, andabout three hours later the eye of the storm pass over the Isle ofpalms just east of Charleston, say Bob Sheets, director of thenational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.The eye be about 10 miles across and top winds be still at 135mph.Hugo be expect to turn gradually to the north, cause severeflooding as it move up the East Coast. The storm pose a 19 percentchance of hit New York City and a 16 percent chance of hittingboston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.as Hugo near the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,200 miles north, be nearly empty, as be the boarded-up resorttowns themselves. Power lines and trees be down in some spotsand water flood roads. Stop lights and neon lights be knockedout in Myrtle Beach.One eyewitness say `It's like a light show,' say AmyGarrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.In Charleston, the hurricane litter streets with tin roofs,palmetto fronds and chunks of bark. Businesses be closed andclasses at public schools and universities canceled. Riley orderedresidents of one-story homes to evacuate.Hospitals stockpile supplies, discharge any patients wellenough to go and move others to hospitals inland to make room foremergency patients, officials said.about 12,000 people have check into 83 shelters across the stateas of Thursday evening, and more be expected, say bennish Brown,a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220miles northwest of here.we try to close the doors but people be sneak in sidedoors, say Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse work at theconway high School shelter near Myrtle Beach. We try to postguards at the doors, but people be still come in.american Red Cross relief efforts be buckle under the numberof evacuees, say Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., whoappealed for help.right now the Red Cross be shelter tens of thousands ofpeople all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course be at the sametime that we're shelter 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and theother Caribbean islands.we're begin to feel the squeeze. Our resources be verytight. Right now Hugo be shape up to be one of our big reliefoperations of the decade.at midnight, the center of Hugo be near latitude 32.7 degreesnorth and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. Thehurricane's speed have pick up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.near its center, Hugo's muscle reach winds of 135 mph, up from125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North andSouth Carolina can expect tornadoes link to Hugo for the next twodays, accord to the hurricane center.the coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12hours once the eye come ashore, officials said. A hurricane warningwas in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.By late afternoon, Hugo be upgrade to a category 4 hurricane onthe Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,which indicate it could cause extreme damage.it strengthen more than we think it would, Sheets said,adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it move up theappalachians.the timing of the landfall be critical because of the storm'stidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would fee anormal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.on top of that will be waves, Sheets say earlier, and inmany places on barrier islands the buildings will be sweep cleanoff.Amid the uproar of live coverage by themajor networks and scores of other media organizations, NationalHurricane Center forecasters go about their business of monitoringhurricane Hugo.The whole system look chaotic, but it works, say BobSheets, the center's director.on one side of a large room dominate by a u-shaped bank ofmonitoring equipment be the forecasters, making meticulouscalculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike andgetting emergency operations go in those areas.On the other side be the media a pack of reporters, cameraoperators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time andtidbits of his expertise.in the center be Sheets himself. surround by cameras, wiresand two dozen journalists with pads and telephones, the ubiquitousred-headed meteorologist have appear on television all week next toa large satellite monitor show colorful images of Hurricane Hugo.During prime news time, compete technicians and cameramen shoutand make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots ofSheets.At his back, casually dressed forecasters who have be working12-hour days track the storm via computers and satellites.we obviously don't like this and could probably do a betterjob, but everyone knows now because of the media, say hurricanespecialist Max Mayfield. In the Caribbean, we be not so certainthe word get out. But we know the Carolinas have be evacuated.when a hurricane warning go into effect, It's a $50 millionstatement, say meteorologist Joel Cline, refer to the cost ofemergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implementedwhen the warning be posted.If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm be outthere, he said. Before the hurricane warn system wasestablished, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands oflives. But early today, after days of warnings and proper evacuationprocedures, there be no immediate reports of deaths despitewidespread damage in Charleston and other coastal areas of SouthCarolina.I like to think that we make a difference a far as human livesare concerned, Cline said.after Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecasters begin towind down from the hectic pace they have maintain for the lastseveral days. But, he warned, the hurricane center still isfollowing three other weather systems that have move into theatlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm inthe Pacific.I hate to say we're breathe a sigh of relief because peopleare get clobber to death, meteorologist Mark Zimmer say asthe storm pound Charleston, S.C. But we've do all we can.damage from Hurricane Hugo, which storm through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers. New york-based American International Group Inc. expect net losses relate to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. Analysts say AIG have tell them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remain damages. AIG insure property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., base in St. Paul, Minn, say the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount take into consideration what St. Paul expect to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said. philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. be expect to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimate that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduce by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. say its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimate claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpass the company's record payout for a single disaster. When damages in North Carolina and Virginia be added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million. It say that be more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.The greenhouse effect may breed big anddeadlier hurricanes in the future, storm up to 50 percent strongerthan Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, somemeteorologists say.hugo blast the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mphwinds this past week, kill at least 41 people.just before Hugo strike the U.S. coast, its pressure be measuredat 940 millibars. That make it among the 12 strong hurricanesthis century to hit the United States, the National HurricaneCenter's Miles Lawrence say today.gilbert, whose winds reach 180 mph, tear up the Caribbean lastyear, kill 300 and cause $2 billion damage. It be the mostpowerful hurricane ever recorded.gilbert seem to be about the upper limit of a hurricane withcurrent ocean temperatures, say Kerry Emanuel of the meteorologydepartment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, thewind speeds might be 25 percent high which mean the destructiveforce would be more like 50 percent higher, he said.stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center foratmospheric Research in Denver, say his research suggest thewarming trend be already here.schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a newbook Global Warming, say six of the 10 hot years in thelast 100 occur in the 1980s.He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.Hugo demonstrate the effect of warm Atlantic waters when itswinds jump from 105 mph to 135 mph as it pass over the GulfStream before hit the East Coast, Schneider said.you'll get bad hurricanes if the Caribbean be warmer, hesaid. And I think there be better-than-even odds that you willhave strong hurricanes.emanuel say if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanesof the future could grow to Gilbert's strength and future Gilbertswill be even stronger.gilbert be so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the nationalhurricane center, say forecasters may have to use an intensityscale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with fivethe highest.the computer models schneider use show that in a worst-casescenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jumpby 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas which bothcontribute to the greenhouse effect continue to pour into theatmosphere unchecked.it be possible that even though the world as a whole heat up,the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler. But he say that isunlikley.that's not what the models be showing, Schneider said. Andthat's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.

Satellites, computers, and reconnaissance planes helped forecasters monitor Hugo's progress. Insurance claims broke records. The greenhouse effect could raise future storms' destructive power by 50%.","Category 4 Hurricane Hugo did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean on Sep 17, 1989, and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo. Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.",Hurricane Hugo Could Have Been Deadlier. Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing.

Ramos have deny all allegations.The last cease-fire with the rebels collapse in January 1987after troops fire on farmers demonstrate outside Mrs. Aquino'soffice for land reform.president Corazon Aquino say todayshe will not allow Ferdinand Marcos to come home to die and hergovernment will not permit the oust president to be bury onphilippine soil.marcos' wife Imelda appeal today to Mrs. Aquino to open herheart and allow the former president to return. Marcos' lawyeralso ask the Philippine Supreme Court to order the return,pledging the ousted leader would cooperate with the Aquinoadministration.Marcos be report in critical condition today in a Honoluluhospital after undergo emergency kidney surgery. Hospitalofficials say the 71-year-old former Philippine leader wassuffering from renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure.in Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza say Imelda have leave thehospital to make a final appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husbandto die in his homeland.mrs.

Land reform, the centerpiece programof her administration, be dead.abad's troubles begin in February when he try unsuccessfullyto block the lease of government land in Cavite province to Japan'sMarubeni Corp., for an industrial park.Although the deal be approve by the National DevelopmentCorp., Abad, a former congressman, say the land should bedistributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program.the Department of Trade and Industry say the Marubeni deal wascrucial to attract much-needed foreign investment for thegovernment's industrialization program.But the Department of Agrarian Reform say if the Cavite landwas exempted, hundreds of landlords would try to have theirproperty declare as a potential industrial site to avoid losingtitle.the presidential staff finally work out a compromise underwhich farmers would be offer either land or a cash settlement.abad reluctantly agree to the formula under repeat orders frommrs. Aquino.Abad's firm stand, however, alarmed landowners in Congress, whofloated rumors in the press that the agrarian Reform Department wasriddled with Communists.Lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to thepro-aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party block Abad'sconfirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned.despite the party's victory, poltical damage to it and Mrs.Aquino be considerable. The Manila press transform Abad into afolk hero, depict him as the champion of the farmer againstpolitical barons of the Struggle of the democratic Filipino Party,dubbed Landlord-Dominated Party.Worry not about Abad's destiny, Mrs. President, wrotecolumnist Carol Arguillas in The Manila Chronicle. Worry aboutyours and how you blow the last chance for liberal support.mrs. Aquino pledge publicly to work for Abad's confirmation,but her lobbying appear ineffectual. Abad's strong opponentsincluded politicians who consistently support Mrs. Aquino, leadingto speculation she be not disappointed when he departed.abad's opponents include her young brother, Rep. JosePeping Cojuangco, who wield considerable influence ingovernment.There be no way Cory Aquino will challenge Peping, say onewestern diplomat, speak on condition of anonymity.mrs. Aquino come from a landlord family. She and her brothersand sisters be partners in a 14,500-acre sugar plantation intarlac province. Rather than break up the estate, they use a legaloption and create a profit-sharing plan for the tenants.the Abad controversy be the late in a series of blows to theagrarian reform program, once tout as the centerpiece of theadministration.last year, agrarian Reform Secretary Philip Juico resign afterdisclosures that his department pay vastly inflate sums formarginal land.his successor, Miriam Defensor Santiago, be repeatedly rejectedby the Commission on Appointments, only to be reappointed untilmrs. Aquino replace her with Abad on Dec. 31.No reason for the change be given. But Mrs. Santiago claim shedid not display sufficient public loyalty to Mrs. Aquino during acoup attempt in early december.agrarian reform be widely see as a mean for break thepower of landlord families and uplift the livelihood of millionsof peasants. The program be advertise as essential in curb the21-year-old rural-based Marxist insurgency.mrs. Aquino proclaim a land reform program in 1987 but leftdetails to congress.

To have people who know very little aboutprofessional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personallythat I have some political motive be totally unjustified.philibosian instead point the finger at the man who defeatedhim, current District Attorney Ira Reiner. Philibosian say Reinerhurt prosecutor's chances by dismiss charges against five of theoriginal seven defendants and criticize the case in a 1986 60Minutes interview.but Reiner, call his dismissal of charges for lack ofevidence the decision we're proud of, say the trial take solong because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system,delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess leave behind byphilibosian.this be a case I inherited, Reiner said.in interviews, many jurors say they believe some of thechildren be molested, but the prosecution never establish thatthe defendants be responsible.even if you accept that the children be molested, it didn'tnecessarily mean they be molest at the McMartin Pre-School,said juror Brenda Williams.Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestationcase denounce the techniques of a child therapy center and apolice department letter that inflame parents and ignite the case.seven jurors who speak with reporters in a joint news conferenceafter acquit Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartinBuckey, on 52 molestation charges Thursday say they felt somechildren who testify may have be molest but not at thefamily-run McMartin Pre-School.And they say some children may have merely repeat storiestold them by their parents and interviewers at Children's InstituteInternational.The private child therapy center, which specialize in abusedchildren, videotape interviews with children from the McMartinschool after reports of molestations surfaced. Jurors saw the tapesin which interviewers use anatomically explicit puppets andleading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation fromchildren.asked what lead to acquittals, juror Brenda Williams focus onthe taped interviews from the center jurors call CII.The CII interviews I could not accept them, Mrs. Williamssaid. I believe the children believe what they be say wastrue. But at CII, I could not tell if the children be say whatwas tell to them (by interviewers) or if they be repeat whattheir parents have tell them.If the CII tapes have not be enter into evidence and I hadnot see them, I could have believe the children a little more,'mrs.

But if the child be socontaminated (by the interviews) I couldn't.equal criticism be aim at a letter send in 1983 by themanhattan Beach Police Department to parents of McMartin schoolchildren. The letter alert parents to a claim of molestation atthe school and to Buckey's arrest.the police letter should never have be sent, say jurorsally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker.

But the jurors weresharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.the children be never allow to say in their own words whathappened to them, say juror John Breese. All the questionswere leading.if the CII tapes have not be enter into evidence and I hadnot see them, I could have believe the children a little more,juror Brenda Williams said.but MacFarlane say that the interview techniques be sound,noting that small children must be interview differently thanadults.i didn't put words into their mouths, she said. I try toenable them to get over their fears.macfarlane acknowledge that some procedures could have beendone differently, include conduct more interviews over alonger period of time. She call the outcome of the case atragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to thesechildren.but the institute's executive director, Mary M.

I fear thatbecause of this verdict, no child will be see as a crediblewitness from now on.his son, now 10, attend the school for 1{ years but wasn't awitness at the trial.i don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into thecourts.

The underground tunnels be never found.no proof be ever produce of Satanic rituals.reiner say the system must be change to prevent such long,expensive prosecution.It take far too long and cost far too much money to have whathas be call perfect justice.

Trree menare vie to succeed her as Conservative Party leader and thusprime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for Tuesday.Traditional male attitudes remain strong in Britain, from theupper-crust, all-male clubs of London to the topless women pictureddaily in the tabloid press.Women be pay less than men and be poorly represent inmanagement jobs and in Parliament.However, campaigners for women rights say there be encouragingsigns at the grassroots.the critical mass of women have enter middle management ingovernment and business, say Lesley Abdela, a founding member ofthe 300 Group.The group seek equal representation for women in the 650-seathouse of Commons, which now have 43 female members.Women represent 43 percent of the british labor force in 1988,compared with 40 percent in 1979 when Mrs. Thatcher become primeminister. Britain have a high proportion of work women thanother European Community countries.Though Mrs. Thatcher never make a priority of women's issues,she do introduce some helpful legislation: tax concessions forworkplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; andlegislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits.but as prime minister, she anger feminists by oftenemphasizing women's traditional roles of homemakers andcare-givers.angela Rumbold, the Conservative Party's minister for women'sissues, contend that an enormous amount have be do forwomen during the Thatcher years.I'm not sure what she could have go beyond promote peoplewho be there just because they be women, she say in aninterview. Margaret Thatcher be a great meritocrat. She believesin get people to succeed on their merits.jo Hawkins of the 300 Group, which be seek equal numbers ofwomen in the House of Commons, believe Mrs. Thatcher'sextraordinary abilities make it difficult for her to understand theneeds of the average woman.she would say that anybody can do it, just stick to yourprinciples and get up and do it, Ms. Hawkins said. I thinkbecause of her character, her personality and her amazingself-confidence, she isn't aware of how the normal personstruggles.prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have weaken herposition and kick off the race to succeed her by say she plansto step down after win another term, opposition leaders andpolitical observers said.a pro-thatcher newspaper today say she have merely state theobvious and that her statements be no cause for astonishment.mrs. Thatcher tell The Sunday Correspondent in an interviewpublished Sunday that she hop to lead her Conservative Party to afourth successive election but say it be unlikely she would tryfor a fifth.i think people would think it be time for someone else tocarry the torch, she tell the newspaper.the Sunday Times of London say in a commentary: Mrs. Thatcherhas commit a colossal blunder.she have give the riders for the Tory succession theirstarting orders years in advance of the actual race, thenewspaper said.the next election must be hold by the summer of 1992, but it isexpected Mrs. Thatcher will call it in 1991.Mrs. thatcher, who turn 64 last month, have never previouslymade it clear in public when she plan to retire as party leader.she be elect in 1979, the first female prime minister in Europe,and win re-election in 1983 and in 1987, when she say she plannedto go on and on.earlier this year, Mrs. Thatcher overtake Liberal Lord Asquith's1908-1916 tenure as prime minister to become Britain's longestcontinuously serve prime minister of the 20th century.mrs. Thatcher's popularity be the low of any prime ministersince opinion polls begin in Britain 50 years ago, and seniorcolleagues have publicly admonish her to change her leadershipstyle follow the surprise resignation of her treasury chief,nigel Lawson.Lord Callaghan, former Labor prime minister whom Mrs. Thatcherdefeated in 1979, say her comments have considerably weaken herposition.if her party win the next election, it be expect Mrs.Thatcher would step down before her term end to allow hersuccessor to choose a time to call a new election.my guess be that the Tory party will want someone as leaderwho could take them through the next Parliament, Callaghan said.if Mrs. Thatcher resigns while in office, her successor electedby the party automatically become prime minister with approval ofqueen Elizabeth II, but convention dictates that he or she seek amandate in a general election as soon as possible.the Sunday Times speculate she would step down by 1994. Mrs.Thatcher would celebrate her 69th birthday that year and herhusband, Denis, will be 79 and his age may have be a factor inher decision, the newspaper said.the newspaper predict the opposition Labor Party will try topromote leader Neil Kinnock as the occupant-in-waiting of 10Downing St., who be ready, able and willing to complete a fullterm.kinnock call Mrs. Thatcher's comments the interview ofsomeone prepare herself for quitting. Mentally, Margaret Thatcheris prepare herself for pack her bags.in an editorial today, the pro-thatcher Daily Telegraph saidmrs.

42,d075b,"The expensive practice of use ballooncatheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heartattacks, now routinely do at many large hospitals, be unnecessaryand should be abandoned, accord to a major study release Tuesday.The study find that if heart attack victims quickly receiveclot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of thecommon balloon procedure, know as angioplasty.some experts say the results be good news, because they meanthat most heart attack patients can be treat in communityhospitals, where angioplasty be not available.the study also have an important financial message. Its authorsestimated that if angioplasty be widely adopt after heartattacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704million.This trial have settle one of the most important questions inmodern-day cardiology, comment Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of theuniversity of Washington, Seattle.The study be phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial InfarctionTrial, or TIMI-II, direct by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Brigham andwomen's Hospital in Boston.The first phase of the study show that give people aclot-dissolving drug call tissue plasminogen activator, or tpa,immediately after heart attacks dramatically improve their chancesof survival.the late study, present at the annual meeting of the AmericanHeart Association, be intend to see whether people do betterstill if doctors try to clear away any remain blockages aftergiving TPA.At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomlyassigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of theirheart attacks if tests show there be any chance they mightbenefit. Sixty percent of them actually undergo the procedure,which temporarily inflate balloons in dangerously narrowed heartarteries to squeeze them open.A comparison group of 1,626 also get TPA. But they be notconsidered for angioplasty unless they have linger heart pain orabnormal exercise tests during their recovery.after 42 days, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group haddied or suffer further heart attacks, as do 10 percent of thosein the comparison group.a year after the treatment, there be no difference in survival.about 93 percent of both groups be still alive.there do not appear to be any additional benefit fromangioplasty, Braunwald said.dr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented,we have the answer in this trial to a very important question ofhealth care delivery.While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heartattack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labswhere angioplasty be performed.If the study have find that immediate angioplasty improvessurvival, it would have mean that many more angioplasty labs wouldneed to be establish and more doctors train to give theprocedure.the watch word be watchful wait to see if patients needangioplasty. This ultimately make it possible for patients to betreated in community hospitals and be transfer to terciary carecenters if angioplasty be needed, say Dr. Howard Morgan,immediate past president of the heart association.heart attacks occur when a clot block an artery that feed theheart muscle. The purpose of TPA and similar drugs be to dissolvethese clots before the muscle dies. To be effective, the drugs mustbe give within about four hours of the start of heart attacksymptoms.Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victimsare consider to be candidates for the drugs. many people delaygoing to the hospital until permanent damage occurs. In others, thetreatment may be consider too dangerous because of recent surgeryor a history of strokes.balloon angioplasty be also widely use to treat people withclogged heart arteries who have not suffer heart attacks. Thelatest study do not question the usefulness of this kind ofangioplasty.Deaths from heart and blood vesseldisease drop 24 percent over the past decade, but it remain byfar the nation's big killer, take a life every 32 seconds, theamerican Heart Association say Sunday.The good news be that we continue to see an improvement in thedeath rate from the big killer of our population, say Dr.Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who be presidentof the heart association.those trends be dramatic and don't seem to be reversing, shesaid. The bad news be that heart disease be still kill almost 1million Americans a year, and we've get a long way to go.the association release the statistics at its annual forum forscience writers.Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination ofhealthier live habits, include few cigarettes and good food,and improve medical treatment.The public ought to appreciate the progress that have be madein heart disease over the past 20 years, say Dr. Myron L.Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University. It's almost unbelievable.There be almost no form of heart disease that we can't approachwithout meaningful treatment.however, Weisfeldt, who be president-elect of the heartassociation, also caution that much work remains, both inimproving care and encourage people to take good care of theirhealth.i believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemicheart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stopsmoking, get cholesterol treat if it's above 220, and identify andtreat hypertension, he said.ischemic heart disease be the clogging of blood vessels that feedthe heart. It underlie most heart attacks, the single most lethalheart ailment.association figures indicate that in 1986 the most recent yearfor which there be statistics an estimate 978,500 Americans diedfrom heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart andblood vessels. Cancer, the no. 2 killer, take 466,000 lives.between 1976 and 1986, the death rate from all forms ofcardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It decline 28 percent forheart attacks and 40 percent for strokes.the association's figures show that more than one in fourAmericans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almosthalf of those eventually die from it.about 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before thevictim reach the hospital. Studies show that about half of allheart attack victims wait more than two hours before get to anemergency room.weisfeldt say a major health goal be get people to go to thehospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heartattacks. During this period, there be still time to give them drugsto dissolve the blood clots that be cause their heart attacks.This treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heartattacks.other major goals, he said, include find ways to improve theeffectiveness of angioplasty, a technique that use balloons to openclogged heart arteries, and find surgical and medical techniquesto identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest.the heart association estimate that cardiovascular disease willcost $88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lose wages.among other statistics release by the association:the most common cardiovascular disease be high blood pressure,which affect 60 million Americans.About 200,000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease eachyear occur in people under age 65.There be 1,418 heart transplants in 1987, almost nine times asmany as in 1983.About 2.5 million Americans have angina, the chest painresulting from clogged heart arteries. About 300,000 new cases occurannually.as many as 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks thisyear.a drug that ease the heart's workload cancut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent inpeople recover from heart attacks, accord to a major studyreleased Thursday.The study, conduct in Denmark, find that the drug Verapamil,known as a calcium channel blocker, be effective for the 1{ yearsafter a heart attack. Calcium blockers be among several classes ofmedicines commonly prescribe to relieve high blood pressure.this be the first trial that indicate that a calcium blockermay be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction, or heartattack, say Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.Several other studies of calcium blockers, include one largeu.s. study publish last year, fail to find any benefit fromusing the medicines after heart attacks.according to the Danish study, Verapamil be about as effectiveas another variety of blood pressure medicines know as betablockers at protect people after heart attacks.While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heartattacks, the researchers say these drugs still should have a rolein treatment.we feel it be important to have alternatives. many patients donot tolerate beta blockers, say Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard ofcentral County Hospital in Hillerod, Denmark, a co-author of thestudy.beta blockers be generally not recommend for people withasthma and emphysema. This mean the drugs often cannot be give tocigarette smokers, who be frequent victims of heart attacks.In the study, conduct at 20 community hospitals, doctorscompared 897 patients who get Verapamil after heart attack with878 people who take placebos.after 18 months of followup, there be 146 deaths or recurringheart attacks among the Verapamil patients, compare with 180 inpeople who get the dummy medication.we want to see if an effect would be observe withverapamil, say Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen MunicipalHospital.If it have an effect, it should be see in the first 12 to 18months, because there be a big increase in mortality in myocardialinfarction in this period, he said. then it levels off. That'swhat we demonstrated. It worked.the researchers believe that by reduce the amount of workneeded by the heart to sustain circulation, calcium blockerslowered the chances of ischemia, episodes in which the heart's ownmuscle be deprive of oxygen.they say they be unsure why early studies fail to showany benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks. However,they note that some studies enrol patients who be also takingbeta blockers. And this might have obscure any benefits fromcalcium blockers.the results be present at a meeting of the American Collegeof Cardiology. Among other research describe at the meeting:dr. James H. Chesebro of the Mayo Clinic say a five-year studyfound that aspirin do not stop the continued buildup of existingblockages in the arteries feed the heart, although it maymodestly protect against the development of new deposits. However,like other studies, this one find that aspirin signficantly cutthe risk of heart attacks.dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School say the nextphase of a large study of clot-dissolving drugs will see whateffect they have in unstable angina. This be a condition in whichpeople suffer spontaneous chest pain that be not trigger by workor stress. Until now, the drugs have be use only to treat heartattacks.an intestinal operation to lower the cholesterolof heart attack patients reduce their risk for another heartattack or death from heart disease, researchers say today.the surgery, call a partial ileal bypass, have one significantdrawback: It cause chronic diarrhea that persist for years.in the operation, doctors change the route of the smallintestine so about one-third of it be bypassed. This reduce theamount of cholesterol that be absorb into the bloodstream.the $52 million, 17-year study be conduct on people who hadalready suffered heart attacks. The approach lengthen the livesof people who have very mild heart attacks but not those with moresevere heart damage.during an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate amongsurgery patients who have sustain minimal heart damage be 24percent. In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percent.dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directedthe study, say the surgery should be consider along withcholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.it have a role in the management of patients with highcholesterol who have have a heart attack, Buchwald said. It iseminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not hada heart attack.besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery be somewhatmore prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinalobstructions.the study be conduct in Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and publish in today's NewEngland Journal of Medicine.Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remainabout whether it actually help people live long if they alreadyhave healthy hearts. Although the late study be conductedexclusively on people who have suffer heart attacks, Buchwald saidhe believe the research should settle that question.it offer the strong justification for marked lipid(cholesterol) ineervention that have ever be offered, Buchwaldsaid. It be a very powerful study and should, except for certainpeople who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterolcontroversy.in the study, 421 people who recover from heart attacksunderwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people weretreated with diet alone. At the start of the study, their averagecholesterol levels be 251. The surgery lower people'scholesterol 23 percent.the overall risk of die from heart disease or sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack be reduce 35 percent among thesurgical patients with the healthy hearts. The surgical patientsalso require less than half as many coronary bypass operationsbecause of clogged heart arteries.new treatments that stop a heart attack in itstracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quicklythan ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, astudy publish today concludes.Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effects of send a few carefully select heart patients homeearly. They find that these people have no unusual complications,got back to work sooner and have substantially low medical bills.it be an extraordinarily safe strategy, say Dr. Eric J.Topol, the study's director. There be no problems with anyserious events.Topol say the early discharges be make possible by two recentmedical advances tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, andangioplasty.when give quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clotsin the heart's arteries and minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar results by open up the clogged arteries withtiny balloons.the report represent the late in a steady three-decade trendof send heart attack patients home from the hospital after evershorter stays.however, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine saidmore research be need before the findings be widely adopted.In the 1950s, doctors often recommend that patients stay inbed for one to two months after a heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffer an uncomplicated heart attack in1955, he spend seven weeks recover in the hospital.however, doctors learn that long inactivity do more harm thangood. Patients get out of shape, develop blood clots and becamedemoralized.in the 1960s, the stay be shorten to three weeks and in the1970s to two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalize seven to 10 days.In their paper, the doctors determine that 80 of the 507 heartattack patients study be healthy enough to be consider forearly discharge. none of them have irregular heart beats, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill test show no signs of heart attackdamage.forty patients be send home after three days, while the reststayed seven to 10 days. After six months of followup, none haddied, and the number of medical problems in both groups be similar.however, people in the early discharge group be able to returnto work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medicalbills be significantly low $12,546 versus $17,868.The researchers estimate that if 15 percent of all heart attackpatients be discharge after three days, the annual saving wouldbe at least $280 million.in an accompany editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputyeditor of the journal, caution that the study be not largeenough to spot complications that might result from reducinghospital stays.this single study, he wrote, be not sufficient to justifysweeping changes in current management practices for all patientswho may at first appear to have uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors should be cautious in prescribe aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research support its value, the Food and Drug Administration said. take aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some people's chances of dying of other things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, the agency say in a commentary in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. The FDA persuade aspirin makers in March to refrain from promote aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks, at least for now. A study publish in January indicate an aspirin every other day reduce the risk of nonfatal, first heart attack 47% in 11,000 male doctors over five years, compare with 11,000 who take a non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tend to promote bleeding by reduce the ability of blood platelets to help form clots. Heart attack usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourish the heart and choke off its blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risks for people who already have clot problems, or for those who have high blood pressure, which put them at increase risk for hemorrhagic strokes, the FDA commentary said. Strokes be the result of brain damage cause by bleed in the brain or by blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes be those cause by bleeding. The FDA commentary point to 10 hemorrhagic strokes record among the 11,000 subjects take aspirin in the recent study, compare with two such strokes among 11,000 subjects take the substitute. Overall death rates for the two groups be the same, though the aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate be much lower. There be 104 nonfatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and 189 in the comparison group. ""Physicians, will, for a time, be force to make their professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information,"" say the FDA commentary, co-written by agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree with them completely,"" say Dr. Julie Buring, a Harvard University researcher who participate in the aspirin study. She add in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study be under way, and researchers expect to report to the FDA in late fall. The commentary note a british study, also release in January, of 5,000 male physicians that find that aspirin fail to protect against heart attacks, and that it be associate with a 2 1/2-fold increase in disable strokes.a drug use to treat patients complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recur heart attacks infour out of five heart patients, accord to a study publish intoday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.Surprisingly, however, the study find that the drug, diltiazem,increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whosehearts pump abnormally, experts said.even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of thedrug, which be now primarily use to treat angina, doctors said.the drug be test in 38 hospitals in the United States andcanada on patients who have recently suffer a heart attack, saiddr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the Universityof Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.the results suggest the drug may be quite effective indecreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majorityof patients, Moss said. But the study also surprisingly suggeststhat patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be givendiltiazem because the drug increase the chance of a subsequentheart attack.we now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to,Moss said. That's what this study be all about.diltiazem be a calcium entry blocker, the new class of drugsto be introduce in the fight against heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blockers be the other types commonly prescribe by doctors.the study involve 2,466 heart attack patients, who be giveneither 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo. Patientswere recruit from 1983 to 1986 and follow for 12 to 52 months.Overall, the drug only decrease additional heart attack 11percent, which be not statistically significant, Moss said.but in patients who have normal or near-normal heart pumpfunction 1,909 patients or 80 percent of the total group diltiazem decrease the chance of another heart attack by 25percent, Moss said.in patients whose hearts have pump problems, the drug not onlydidn't help, but it increase the chance of a heart attack by 25percent.Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at StanfordUniversity, say he be surprise that the drug increase thechance of heart attack in any group and that overall results werenot higher.But the bottom line be that this be the first study to showthat diltiazem can be effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug ona long-term basis.dr. George Beller, a cardiologist and professor at theuniversity of Virginia, say he be also somewhat surprise aboutthe increase in heart attacks in the group suffer pulmonarycongestion.this be one of the first reports that seem to identifythat, he said.diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers be introducedin the past decade, Beller said, and research into how effectivethey be in various applications be in its early stages.Nitrates have be use for more than 50 years, and betablockers be develop in the 1960s.Aspirin sales jump 41 percent for a few weeksearlier this year, not because of a rash of headaches.a study of more than 22,000 male doctors have show that take asingle aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half.the study be one of a series of recent reports show for thefirst time that doctors be able not only to treat heart attacks but also to prevent them.in the most recent report, doctors find that one aspirin tabletand a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug give within 24 hourscan dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.Without the treatment, patients have a 13 percent chance of dyingfrom a second heart attack within five weeks, the researchersfound. With the treatment, the figure drop to 8 percent.The real discovery be that treatment for patients be go toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, say Richard Peto ofoxford University, one of the study's authors.heart disease be the nation's lead cause of death, by far.the National Center for Health Statistics reports that 762,820Americans die of heart disease in 1987.To put it another way: Of the 2,127,000 American who die thatyear, more than one in three died of heart disease. (this do notinclude those who die of blood-vessel diseases, such as strokes.)the drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventingheart attacks be the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby,aspirin.the usual cause of heart attacks be a blockage of the coronaryarteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. theblockage arise from the buildup of fats, cholesterol and clottedblood.Clot-dissolvers break up clots, thus restore blood flow.aspirin interfere with aspects of the clot process, help toprevent clot formation in the first place.the limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the UnitedStates show that many doctors be still not use them, despitetheir proven success. But that be begin to change.some doctors predict that in the not-too-distant future thesedrugs will be judge so safe that they will be administeredroutinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attackvictims even reach the hospital.we have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to havethe courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitivediagnosis, say Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St.Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.the most important thing we can do be teach patients inadvance about the value of early treatment, he says.while most public attention have focus on this new ability toprevent heart attacks, researchers have also make importantprogress in speed the recovery of patients who survive heartattacks.Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determinedthat some heart attack victims can be release from the hospital assoon as three days after their heart attacks. most heart attacksvictims be keep in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days.the patients give early discharge be able to return to worktwo weeks sooner than others in the study group. After six months,not one death be record in the early-discharge group. Theresearchers conclude that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacksvictims could be safely discharge after three days.in July, Stanford University doctors find that workers who wentback to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attack didat least as well as workers who go back after a more typicalconvalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks.all of these advances come at a time when public health expertsare increasingly emphasize the role of good health and goodnutrition in lower heart disease risk.early next year, the American Heart Association seal of approvalwill begin appear on foods that be low in fat and cholesteroland therefore can help reduce heart disease risk.u.s. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in July issue his firstreport on nutrition, call on Americans to lower theirconsumption of fats and to eat more vegetables, fruits, fish,poultry and whole grains.the report have be liken to the first Surgeon Generals reporton smoking, issue in 1964, which focus public attention onsmoking's hazards. Koop's recommendations largely echo those of theamerican Heart Association, but they should help carry the messageto many more people.progress in research on heart disease be make clear that theheart attack be no longer a mysterious killer that strike withoutwarning and cannot be defend against.much can be do to prevent heart attacks, great improvementsare be make in treatments, and recovery be faster than everbefore.the use of a clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save25,000 live a year in the United States, doctors say.these results, say Dr. Peter Sleight of Oxford University,will change medical practice worldwide.a natural substance call transform growthfactor beta appear to be able to limit damage to cardiac cellsfollowing a heart attack, accord to a study publish in thejournal Science.In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, agroup of laboratory rats induce to have heart attacks suffer 50percent less cell damage after injections of transform growthfactor beta than do rat that do not receive the TGF beta.tgf beta be a growth factor that oppose some of the bad guysfollowing a heart attack, say Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor atjefferson.lefer say his research team simulate heart attacks in 24 ratsby partially block key arteries in their hearts.in 12 of the rats, the researchers inject a placebo. In theother 12, they inject transform growth factor beta.For those who receive the TGF beta, say Lefer, the damagefrom the attack be much less severe. There be about 50 percentless injury with TGF beta than without it.the extent of heart cell damage be determine by measure theamount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue follow an attack.Hearts damage when the blood supply be interrupted, as in a heartattack, tend to lose creatine kinase, say Lefer. Thus, bymeasuring for the loss of this substance, researchers coulddetermine the amount of heart damage.lefer say the TGF beta seem to block the action of othersubstances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause bloodvessels to narrow follow a heart attack. Narrowed blood vesselscarry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this cause additionalinjury follow a heart attack.tgf beta be normally present in heart cells, but the studypublished in Science say that it be miss from rat heart cellsdamaged by a simulated heart attack.Though TGF beta be produce naturally in the body, Lefer saidhis research team use a substance produce artificially bygenentech, a California biotechnology firm.lefer say his team be now conduct additional studies withtgf beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attackvictims with the substance be at least a year away.jefferson Medical College, where the study be done, be part ofThomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.Science, which publish the study, be the journal of theamerican Association for the Advancement of Science.The experiment also hint that the blood and urine test,which measure the activity of a blood protein call renin,might suggest a new ""risk factor"" for heart attacks. Abouthalf of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attackeach year don't have the know risk factors for heartdisease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking,obesity and high blood pressure. It be unknown whatdistinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those whodon't suffer heart attacks.the blood and urine test be already be do in manycommercial laboratories but for medical conditions other thanheart attack risk, say John H. Laragh of the CardiovascularCenter at Cornell University and New York Hospital. ""In ourhands, it cost about $40 and in other labs it may cost thepatient $40 to $80,"" he said. Dr. Laragh pioneer theresearch underlying use of the test, which be develop byhis wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey. The test, which isn'tpatented, be available in kit form to laboratories.the blood portion of the test determine whether thekidneys be release renin into the blood stream and howactive the chemical is. The release of renin be the firststep in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raise bloodpressure. The urine portion of the test tell how much saltis in the bloodstream. A high concentration of salt in theblood also raise pressure.the test be base on the fact that if the saltconcentration in the blood rises, tend to boost bloodpressure, the activity of the renin normally drop to offsetthe effect of the salt.the new experiment be design to test a theory put forthby Dr. Laragh and his colleagues that the activity of therenin in the blood foretell a possible heart attack. Thetheory have provoke sometimes furious controversy for almost20 years.the Cornell cardiologist have argue that in many peoplewith high blood pressure the activity of the renin in theblood be much high than be warrant by the amount of saltin the blood. such ""high renin"" people be at a high risk ofa heart attack. On the other hand, in other patients withhigh blood pressure, the activity of the renin be much lowerthan be warrant by the degree of salt in the blood. These""low renin"" people be at a low risk of heart attack, Dr.Laragh have maintained.in the experiment, blood and urine samples be obtainedat New York City offices and factories from 1,717 worke ","AP881115-0113,AP890115-0014,AP900322-0112,AP901003-0006,AP880428-0041,WSJ880603-0129,AP880818-0088,AP880829-0222,AP900705-0149,WSJ910418-0105",,,,,New medical advances reduce the number of heart attacks nationwide.,"The chances of having a heart attack, the number one killer in the United States, have decreased significantly in the last decade. Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

It just have todo with the probability of an earthquake in this area, Allen said.he note that the 1988 report, title Probabilities of LargeEarthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,presented information that be already widely know amongscientists. Allen say this information should have alertedofficials to take preventive steps.frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center saidthe quake's magnitude be 6.9 on the Richter scale. It be centeredin the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.The Richter scale be a measure of ground motion as record onseismographs. A reading of 6 can cause severe damage. A quake of 7magnitude, a major earthquake, be capable of widespread heavydamage.initial reports indicate widespread damage from Tuesday'squake, especially affect highways and old masonry buildings.it's not like an earthquake of this size in this area be acalamitous event. It's something we should therefore be readyfor, Allen said.the damage in the Bay area occur to the same kind ofstructures heavily damage in the 1987 Whittier quake in the LosAngeles area, which register a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.i think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of viewfrom this earthquake, he said. What will be important be to seehow the modern structures behaved.allen say many of the same kinds of old structures thatappeared to have be damage in San Francisco also exist in thelos Angeles region. In addition, some of the roadways andoverpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of constructionas the Bay Bridge.In some areas of Southern California, there be a higherprobability of a major quake occurring. The highest, the USGS says,is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there be a 90percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastate SanFrancisco, many scientists have believe the next big one wouldstrike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.But studies in recent years have remind the Bay Area that italso face another seismic disaster, and those studies become areality Tuesday when a quake measure 6.9 on the Richter scalerocked the Bay area.a 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predict a6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the SanAndreas Fault that stretch 50 miles from Palo Alto southwardthrough the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.The quake be center on the San Andreas segment describe inthe article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S.Geological Survey office in Pasadena, say it wasn't clear yetwhether it break all or part of the 50-mile segment.the epicenter of the quake be about 8 miles northeast of SantaCruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco.The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professorchristopher Scholz, be among several that produce conflictingestimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finallyhappened tuesday.these studies give various interpretations of how much stressinside the Earth be release by the great San Francisco earthquakeof 1906, which have a magnitude of about 8.3 and kill at least2,500 people.the big a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus thelonger it take for the same size quake to happen again.scholz point to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve asmuch stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientistsbelieved. That suggest a big quake might happen in the SanFrancisco Bay area sooner than some believed.Others disagreed. face with conflict estimates, thegeological Survey issue a July 1988 report that it saidrepresented a consensus on the debate.the report say the 50-mile segment have a 20 percent likelihoodof produce a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years. It say thesouthernmost 20 miles of that segment have a 30 percent chance ofgenerating a magnitude-6.5 quake within 30 years.Tuesday's jolt be center within those southernmost 20 milesof the fault segment.clearly, scientists have identify this segment as aparticularly hazardous one, Heaton said. There be some debateabout the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake.the last great southern California quake, in 1857, kill veryfew people in a region that be then sparsely populated.thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fallvictim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report castdoubt on this assumption.federal emergency officials have estimate that the next bigone a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake could kill3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000people in the Bay Area.As bad as Tuesday's quake was, it be not a 1906 earthquake,geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.the question be not whether a big earthquake be coming.

48,d078b,"Spike Lee may have be wear ageorgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he get a far warmerreception from Syracuse University students than he do fromacademy Award voters.In a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday, leeshrugged off the academy's icy treatment of his late movie, Dothe Right Thing, and blame it on generational politics.the 1989 film, widely hail by critics, receive only twoacademy Award nominations, and isn't be consider for bestpicture or best director.the academy's membership consist mainly of old people, the32-year-old Lee said. He say they be a lot more comfortablewith the black chauffeur in `driving Miss Daisy' than with theangry characters in his film.i still feel we make the best film of the year, he said.asked if racism might have be involve in the academynominations, Lee replied, Racism's involve in everything.Despite the cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse students welcome himas one of their own.he's an african-american, one of the first ones to make it (asa producer and director), and he's address the issues andconcerns affect our community, Syracuse senior Deron Harrissaid. That's why we're so proud of him.What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, CaryGrant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common? theyhave never win Academy Awards for their individual achievements.such flagrant omissions be often cite by critics as evidenceof the unfairness of Hollywood's high prize. Oscar's 60-yearhistory be fill with examples of the film world's highestachievers be overlook by the Academy of Motion Picture Artsand Sciences.The late casualties be directors James L. Brooks, whose moviebroadcast News be nominate though he wasn't, and Spielbergwho be leave out in the cold with his empire of the Sun.Although Broadcast News win seven major nominations,including best picture and three act categories, Brooks wasstrangely overlook by the Academy's direct branch.since no movie have ever win a best picture oscar without itsdirector at least be nominated, the chances of the once-favoredbroadcast News to be a big winner at the awards ceremony onapril 11 have be significantly reduced.brooks do better in 1984 when his Terms of Endearment tookthe lion's share of Oscars, include best picture and director.spielberg's Empire of the Sun win six nominations this year,none of them major and none for director. Two years ago, TheColor Purple receive 11 nominations but not for him as director.the Directors Guild nevertheless name him best director that year.i'm floor by this, Spielberg say upon receive his dgaaward. This be the last thing I expect to happen. ... If someof you be make a statement thank God I thank you for that.why the Spielberg slight? Some observers cite the fact that only257 directors nominate for the Academy Awards, and many areveterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films arethe big moneymakers in history (Jaws, E.T., Raidersof the Lost Ark).The Academy appear to make amends last year by presentingspielberg with the Irving Thalberg award for consistently highquality of production. There be no mention of the fact thatspielberg be primarily a director, not a producer.the Thalberg award have come in handy to acknowledge giants whowere overlook for individual awards. The recipients have includedcecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergmanand Mervyn Leroy.The honorary award have also prove useful to salve the Academy'sconscience. Charlie Chaplin receive one at the first AcademyAwards for his creation of The Circus and again at the 44thawards for the incalculable effect he have have in make motionpictures the art form of this century.douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch,Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, MauriceChevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G.Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir be others whohave receive honorary awards.cary Grant once remark that he never expect to win anacademy Award. I'd have to blacken my teeth first, he quipped,alluding to the Academy's fondness for actors who portray bums anddowntrodden characters.alfred Hitchcock also have a lighthearted comment on why hefailed to win an Oscar: I suppose it be a matter ofcarelessness.The overlook of classic films and the industry's mosttalented filmmakers have provide historians with cause for dispute.for example, Citizen Kane, which customarily place no. 1 onpolls of the great american films, be nominate in 1941 forbest picture (there be 10 nominees in those days), for OrsonWelles' performance, direction and co-scripting with HermanMankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, plus art direction, sound,music and editing.the only Oscar for Citizen Kane be for the script. HowGreen Was My Valley be name best picture.billy Wilder's classic comedy, Some Like It Hot, fail tobe nominate as best picture, as do Chaplin's Modern Times,Hawks' Red River and Woody Allen's Manhattan.Oh, well. Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line from SomeLike It Hot: Nobody's perfect.the Oscar statuette, one of the mostrecognizable images in the entertainment world, have no copyrightprotection, a federal judge have ruled.the small Academy Award statue be part of the public domain,u.s. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters say in a ruling releasedthursday.the decision be a setback for the Academy of Motion PictureArts and Sciences, which have sue a chicago-based manufacturer ofan employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.Academy President Karl Malden say the ruling come as a shockto me. The academy say it would appeal.the academy claim that the Star Award, the trophy look-alikemade by Creative House Promotions, violate copyright laws, dilutedthe academy's trademark and represent unfair competition.the Star Award depict a naked, muscular male much like theoscar, just two inches short and hold a star instead of asword. It have a gold finish similar to the Oscar, and stand on acircular gold cap mount on a cylindrical base.although Waters acknowledge that the Creative House trophy isvery similar to the Oscar, he reject all of the academy'slegal claims, say that the statuette become part of the publicdomain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the CopyrightAct of 1976.The film industry's top award be distribute from the firstceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the c mark indicatinga copyright.the judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only be an honoraryaward but also be use to promote the film industry, and thereforedid not have a limited purpose, as require by the copyrightact.the academy note that the ruling apply only to the statuetteand that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscarand the Academy Award names and symbols be unaffected.we be surprise that the court would base its decision onevents which occur half a century ago, overlook themeticulous fashion in which the Academy have protect the integrityof its institutional symbol for decades, Malden say in astatement.free enterprise have collide with the AcademyAwards, and everybody's try to pick up the pieces.with Oscar statuettes sell at auction for more than $10,000and a Chicago trophy company cast allege Academy Award clones,the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences isscrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnish byhollywood hucksterism.if you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, yourisk have your trademark become public domain, say Bruce Davis,the Academy's executive administrator, in explain the lawsuitsthe organization have file to protect its beloved hunk ofelectroplated pewter.but despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism,this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandisingwrinkle: Some 800 limousines deliver the most famous stars to theoscar telecast will be equip with door-mounted coolers jammedwith Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.when the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditoriumand the celebrities tumble out, the Coke logo will be on display infront of an audience that include millions around the world.it seem like a good marketing opportunity, say Coca-Colaspokesman Ira Gleser. The Academy approach our local bottler inlos Angeles and say we're go to have a lot of thirsty people.but even as the Academy embrace this new intrusion ofmerchandising, it have lash out at whatever else it consider ablemishing of the Oscar name.When MGM-UA, the distributor of Rain Man, publish newspaperadvertisements tout the film's Oscar nominations before thenominations be even announced, the Academy issue a harshstatement condemn mgm-ua's promotional gamble. After the adsappeared, Rain Man collect nine nominations.we regard this as a serious matter, and we have communicatedour concern, say Richard Kahn, president of the Academy.For nearly 50 years, the Academy have maintain strict securityaround both the nominations and the award winners. It also hasenvisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon.so auction the Oscar have greatly distress the Academy.The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthlyentertainment memorabilia auctions, have sell off seven Oscars in thepast year, include the best picture trophy for 1951's AnAmerican in Paris ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for1954's On the Waterfront ($13,000) and the black and whiteinterior decoration Oscar for 1941's How Green Was My Valley($17,715).None be sell by the original recipients; heirs or friends whohad later receive the trophies put them on the block.when Malcolm Willits, the book store's owner, announce that hewould hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy forAround the World in 80 Days, the Academy say enough, initiatinga court action that, for now, have block any future trophy sales.the Academy insist that a contract sign by Oscar winnersmandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offeringthem to the Academy for a nominal fee.but now that the word be out that these awards be worth$10,000 to $50,000, people be reluctant to sell them back to theacademy for $10, Willits said.the Academy have create something of great value here. This isthe most famous award in the world the most instantly recognizableaward. The Nobel Prize might be a great honor, but people knowmore about what an Academy Award look like.and they're very limited, too. There's not too many of themaround. ... Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have a movie poster inyour living room unless you be a college student. Now, you can gointo Beverly Hills homes and there's a movie poster, and the darnthing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.when the Academy win a court order temporarily block futureauctions, Willits decide to sell his store. It seem to be thefinal straw. I don't like lawsuits, he said. I'm get olderand I'd like to write movie scripts.yet the Academy have lose its most recent attempt to save itstrophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit bring againstthe Houston International Film Festival be dismiss March 16 in acalifornia federal court.the Academy have claim the Lone Star Statuette, design andbuilt by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, be practicallyidentical to the Oscar. The court find otherwise.the motion picture industry's most covetedaward, Oscar, be create 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuetteshave be produce so far.weighing 8{ pounds and stand 13{ inches tall, Oscar wascreated by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios art director Cedric Gibbons,who go on to win 11 of the trophies.oscar, manufacture by the R.S. Owens Co., Chicago, be make ofbritannia metal, copper plate, nickel plate and gold plate. From1942 to 1944, the trophy be make of plaster, but winners werelater present with the real thing.according to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,the only engrave mistake be in 1938 when the best actor trophygiven to Spencer Tracy for Boy's Town read: Best Actor: DickTracy.The Academy hold all the rights on the statue and reservesthe right to buy back an oscar before someone take it to a pawnshop, say Academy spokesman Bob Werden.The most-nominated film be All About Eve in 1950. It get 14nominations. Ben-Hur in 1959 be the most-awarded film with 11,and Walt Disney be the most-awarded person with 32.Oscar selection have come under scrutiny as filmstudios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of MotionPicture Arts and Sciences.And with the flood of Oscar vote enticements from free coffeemugs to complimentary buffet dinners academy members areacknowledging that some Oscar voting be do by committee, inviolation of the rules. Secretaries, spouses and friends, severalacademy members say, be mark ballots in what be suppose to bethe entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition.it's like a local election of judges, say Academy memberHarry Clein, who say he's witness team voting. A lot of peopledon't know who the candidates are. so they take a look at who'saround them and see what the consensus is.as far as elections go, it's not bad. But I've never beenthrough an election in Argentina.Dan Lyle, who oversee the Oscar balloting for the accountingfirm Price, Waterhouse Inc., say that there be no guarantee thatacademy members have actually fill out their own ballots.all we know be that a properly number ballot have beenreturned, he said. Members be on the honor system to fill outthe ballot themselves.more than 4,600 members be give ballots this year for the 61stannual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from theshrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Academy members vote on their areaof specialty. The Academy's actors branch, for example, be the onlygroup to select nominees in the four act categories.since the voting be do secretly members do not sign theirballots the ballot's authenticity be ensure solely by a numericcontrol number, Lyle said. Ballots be invalidate only if there ismore than one vote in a give category, and only the votes in thatspecific category be not tallied, he said.nominations for acting, directing, art direction and allspecialized categories be handle by select branches and committeescomposed of Academy members.All vote members of the Academy can participate in the bestpicture nominations and may vote for the final awards in allcategories. Winners for best documentary feature, best animatedshort film and best live-action short film be choose by only thosemembers who have see all the nominees.academy constituent Julian Blaustein say that most of hiscolleagues take the voting very seriously. I don't even vote (in acategory) if I'm not familiar with the pictures in that category.... And I've never tell someone to vote for a film, even when I'vedone some of them.meanwhile, other Oscar voting rules be perhaps be broken,speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman. Although you'reasked to vote in the nominations for five pictures, I think a lot ofpeople figure out that they have a good chance if they just votefor their own picture and leave the other four blank, he said.given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscarvictory have on a film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising thata certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars.The last Emperor take in $18.9 million, close to half thefilm's gross, after it win last year's best picture trophy. Morethan 70 percent of the revenues generate by 1986's best picture,platoon, come after the film be nominated. On average, a bestpicture award be worth about $20 million these days.A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mount by a studio,therefore, can be a good investment. In the case of this year'sawards, a flurry of academy-oriented newspaper advertisements,banquets, complimentary gifts and photo mailings tie to five latereleases appear to have be remarkably successful.this year, all best picture nominees and the large majority oftop act nominees come from movies release in December: TheAccidental Tourist, Dangerous Liaisons, Rain Man andworking Girl be all release after Dec. 16.While these five movies might be good, the nearly completeexclusion of films from the rest of the year have highlight thestudios' mastery of Oscar marketing.i think the Academy Awards be crap, say Terry Gilliam,director of Brazil and the current The Adventures of BaronMunchausen.It's about sell films be all it's about, he said. It'sone more way of flog some films. When `Brazil' get nominate (in1986), they ask me to be a member of the Academy. And I wouldn'tjoin. I just don't want to be a part of that at all.and at least one prominent Academy member, director Carl Reiner,says that the manipulation of Oscar voters have reach new depths.reiner say that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag votes forsigourney Weaver, a best actress nominee for Gorillas in themist, could lead him to vote against the film.i have in my house more color reproductions of Sigourney Weaverand a beautiful gorilla than I need, Reiner say of promotionalmaterial sent to his home. We've get to tell the Academy to stopthis advertising. I'm get turn off on the pictures I like.hollywood (AP) Like all great contests, the annual AcademyAwards ceremony have generate a wealth of statistics and triviaover its 60 years of existence, all carefully chronicle by Oscarhistorians.Here, courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts andsciences, be 20 questions about Oscar:1.

It reach hurricane status when sustain windshit 74 mph.why Gilbert organize and strengthen while other systemsdidn't be a mystery more or less, say University of Miamimeteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.The first part of the summer we be bite our nails,wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop, he saidthursday. That's something meteorologists would like to know moreabout.But the scientists do know what fuel a budding storm oncedevelopment begins. And they know that development be spark whenwinds converge, and that growth be affect by time and place.if that happen in an area where there's plenty of moisture inthe lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), thisconvergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation, Blecksaid.If cloud form, the heat of condensation in the cloudsoccasionally provide `positive feedback' to the convergencepattern. That strengthen it, he said, add that storms canbegin bud only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.eventually, a vortex be created.any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.that's what make the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, thosewinter storms, Bleck said.Hurricanes be useful to the climate machine. Their primaryrole be to transport heat from the low to the upper atmosphere,he said. The sun put energy into the water, the top of theoceans and low part of the atmosphere. That have to bedistributed from the bottom to high levels of the atmosphere.when the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados,warm Atlantic waters nurture it.this time of year in the northwest Caribbean be best fordevelopment, Clark said. If you get a storm in this area inseptember, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This iswhere Camille form and exploded, refer to the 1969 stormthat slam into the Gulf Coast.It be an exciting thing to watch. If you're on the beachwatching the storm surge, it's a different story, he said.the hurricane center say Gilbert be the most intense storm onrecord in terms of barometric pressure, measure at 26.13 inchestuesday night.

51,d064j,"Two corporate executives sit down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns. The subject be no laughing matter, but rather the serious endeavor of find South Korea's Ronald McDonald. Seven years after the U.S. hamburger giant first try to bring its Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arches be finally go up. McAhn Industries Ltd. recently open the first of what it expect will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul. The company be a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young. McDonald's be flourish in 11 other nations in the region. But its entry into South Korea, which have Asia's fastest-growing economy, have be frustrate by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from Seoul on terms. South Korea may be one of McDonald's most promising foreign markets, business analysts say. The country be develop an essential ingredient for the success of a fast-food enterprise: a middle class. hamburger-related fast-food sales in South Korea total $87.5 million last year, a 30% rise from 1986, accord to the Ministry of Finance. Analysts say this year's rise could be much bigger, help by a 25% increase in wages in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expect soon. The business be likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipate post-olympic economic boom here. However, the competition be heat up, and there be ""a good possibility that South Korea already have reach the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket,"" an official for the South Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry says. The competition, besides Wendy's International's 11 shops and six of Burger King, a unit of Pillsbury Co., include home-grown burger chains. McDonald's strategy be to take things slowly, avoid extravagances, Mr. Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say. ""we be start small,"" say Mr. Ahn. ""We're hop to open three outlets this year and five next year. After that, we'd like to open five every year."" equally modest, he says, will be the initial menu: no breakfast, no Chicken McNuggets and no products tailor to national tastes, as offer elsewhere. The venture be reject television commercials in favor of a cheaper, more oldfashioned approach: a brief advertising campaign in newspapers, distribution of fliers and word of mouth. Mr. Sifri say the emphasis will be on develop McDonald's image as an affordable place for the emerge middle class, rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in South Korea. Attention will be give to attract children, he adds. Mr. Ahn say McDonald's talk to 16 potential partners before choose the harvard-trained accountant in 1984. Two years later, McDonald's and Mr. Ahn each put up $1 million in capital and borrow an additional $4 million to form McAhn. McDonald's struggle with the government over McAhn's royalty payments to the U.S. partner -- the issue be resolve -- and over tight import restrictions on food products. The import question ""came down to find a supplier locally who could supply high-quality beef and potatoes at a value,"" McDonald's said. even McDonald's golden arches symbol run into red tape, since the city regulate the size and color of signs. ""it may be against the law, but we're put them up anyway,"" Mr. Ahn says.mcdonald's hamburgers, fries and goldenarches come to China on Monday when the fast-food chain open itsfirst restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine.Hundreds of Chinese wait for hours outside the restaurant inshenzhen, an economic boom town near Hong Kong, for their firsttaste of a McDonald's hamburger, fries or shake.i travel for four hours from a village to get here, saidhuang Rongti, 70, who have lose most of her teeth because of age.you think hamburgers be too challenge for my age?later, after purchase her first big Mac, she inspect itcarefully before take a bite.it taste good, I like it, she announce before slowlyeating the rest.the opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, wherecooking have long be consider a culinary art, may seem odd togourmets. It be estimate there be more than 5,000 differentchinese dishes.in Canton, 125 miles northwest of Shenzhen, chefs specialize insome of the more exotic chinese dishes, such as cat stew, bearpaws, chicken feet and a famed snake dish - dragon and TigerLocked in Battle - make from three kinds of poisonous snakesstewed with leopard meat, and garnish with 20 spices, lemonleaves and chrysanthemum petals.however, many Chinese, who earn an average $32 a month, arestill unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants.in Shenzhen, a chinese special economic zone where foreigninvestors have build factories, salaries be high and workersearn an average of $53 a month.at the restaurant, a Big Mac cost $1.14, a bag of fries 48cents and a shake 74 cents.another U.S. fast food outlet, Kentucky Fried Chicken, open arestaurant in Beijing in 1987, and it now have four outlets there.mcdonald's hopes to open a restaurant in Beijing later.although Kentucky Fried Chicken have become popular, the averagechinese still regard a meal there as a treat, rather than aconvenience, and McDonald's could face the same problems.the 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in a three-story building isoperated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a wholly ownedsubsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong. McDonald's Hong Kong be a 50-50joint venture with McDonald's in the United States.It be manage by a chinese national, Chen Tikang, and his son,chen Yin, who be the restaurant manager. The young Chen returnedrecently from a course at McDonald's hamburger university in OakBrook, Ill.Most of the ingredients use at the restaurant be now importedfrom Hong Kong. But McDonald's executives hope eventually to gettheir supplies of beef and potatoes from China.Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., saidit take two years to prepare for the restaurant's opening and hisambition now be to serve 10 million burgers a year.last month, when McDonald's advertize for 240 staffers for therestaurant, it receive applications from more than 9,000 persons,including college graduates, officials said.i feel I have a good job prospect work here, and it paysbetter, say Henry He, 25, who have a master's degree in garmentand textile. He be an assistant manager at the restaurant.a waiter at the restaurant can earn 53 cents an hour.a factory worker, who wait several hours before she be ableto purchase her hamburger, say she like it because of its sweettaste - the result of tomato ketchup, which be not commonly usedin traditional chinese cooking.as THE value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worryabout a host of obstacles to invest in Russia, Russian officials hadseveral reasons yesterday to feel thankful for McDonald's hamburgers.opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-storeyoffice block, Mr George Cohon, head of McDonald's Canada, could well bedescribed as the russian authorities' idea of a model investor.mcdonald's proven determination 'to be here for the long term' and to serveRussians in their own currency as oppose to the dollars charge by mostother foreign joint ventures be just a couple of reasons for Russiangratitude.Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, praise the fact thatmcdonald's get most of its supplies from inside Russia after set up aDollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow.He also thank McDonald's for provide jobs, a model of western standardsfor the country's decrepit service industry, and finally for what hedescribed as 'the most delicious food'.but despite the jolly open ceremony - with Big Macs, musicians playingthe balalaika, and hundreds of yellow balloons form a giant M - life hasbeen tough for McDonald's since it open its first restaurant in Moscow 31/2 years ago.Although the first Moscow restaurant be the busy mcdonald's in the worldthe plunge rouble, high inflation and constantly change tax rules havebeen a challenge to McDonald's management, who admit that they have noidea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment.'it will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants, what happen tothe rouble, what happen to raw materials that we buy.

After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food.

52,d069f,"The mass emigration of thousands of disaffect East Germans have rekindle reunification talk in West Germany, where some legislators plan to begin explore the possiblity of reunite the two Germanys. No one be predict a date for a possible reunification. Proponents acknowledge the risks of assume too much of east Bloc reform trends, and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to Washington and Moscow. Yet grow signs of ferment in East Germany have give Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government reason to consider the possibilities. Eduard Lintner, parliamentary speaker on german affairs for the joint Christian Democrat and christrian Socialist caucus in the Bundestag, say his committee have place reunification on its October agenda. He say the sessions, which will include government officials and outside experts, hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with West Germany's Western allies, particularly the U.S. ""It have become clear to the world that the Communist system in East Germany be in trouble,"" Mr. Lintner said. ""the time have come for us to show our allies, but also reform-minded people in the East, that german reunification be no longer just a theory but a subject require a serious appraisal of how it could come about."" ""There be still a number of imponderables,"" Mr. Linter conceded. ""for instance, we want the federal government to approach our allies and get their thoughts on the reunification topic."" The U.S. ambassador to Bonn, Vernon a. Walters, earlier this month reaffirm Washington's policy of support a german reunification base on free, democratic elections. But Mr. Walters cause a stir by predict that reunion could occur in the relatively near future. Emerging opposition to uncompromising communist rule in East Germany have raise questions on how long East Berlin's leaders can resist the democratic reforms sweep through neighbor East Bloc countries. Reforms in Poland, Hungary and even the Soviet Union have magnify East Germany's Stalinist controls. fledgling protest groups, and the influential Protestant church, have begin press for reforms in East Germany which, if allow to include free elections, could eventually lead to a reunite Germany, accord to some western experts. Dorothee Wilms, Bonn's cabinet minister for inter-german affairs, say in an interview in the newspaper Welt be Sonntag that recent polls show that between 85% and 90% of all West Germans favor a reunifed Germany. ""The desire for reunification, a feeling of togetherness, a sense of nationhood -- all this have strongly increase in recent years,"" Ms. Wilms tell the newspaper. ""The recent escape movement from the DDR make especially clear that people of both german states want to live free amongst themselves,"" she said, but caution that reunification cannot occur overnight. The first step, she added, ""is the reform process in the DDR."" Most west german governments since 1949 have pay only lip service to the reunification goal set down in the preamble of West Germany's constitution. Political realities have prevent the topic from become a serious issue. Analysts say that four decades of different systems would make reunification difficult. Further, many West german workers worry that a mass influx of East Germans could threaten their jobs. Thousands of East Germans have emigrate to West Germany over the austro-hungarian border since Budapest ignore East Berlin's protests and open its border. Close to 80,000 east german refugees have arrive in West Germany so far this year, either legally or by escaping, and a total of more than 100,000 be expect by December. The Soviets have join East Berlin in criticize Bonn for welcome the east german refugees, and chide Hungary for violate an emigration treaty with East Germany by allow them to leave. Moscow, which have tolerate reforms elsewhere in the East Bloc, be say to be concern by conditions in East Germany, perhaps the most important of its Warsaw Pact satellites. Unconfirmed West german intelligence reports appear in the west german media say Moscow fear a grow dissident movement and mass demonstrations in East Germany by next year. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev accept an invitation to attend East Germany's 40th anniversary celebration, provide an opportunity for serious discussions with Erich Honecker, East Berlin's ail party leader. East Germany's Communist leadership, comment the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, ""has no illusions as to why Gorbachev be honor their 40th anniversary. He certainly will not say 'well done, keep it up.'""the government on Thursday allow for thepossibility of a reunified Germany, but say such a state must beformed gradually and respect Poland's borders.In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on theissue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski tell Parliament thetwo German states could be join as part of the process of unitingeurope.he say german reunification cannot go ahead of thereunification of Europe.A reunite Germany will not be create tomorrow or the dayafter tomorrow, Skubiszewski said. Fears and concerns appearingevery now and then, include in Poland, be unjustified, althoughalertness be recommended.asked about german reunification at a news conference in Gdansk,Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa say he prefer no politicalchanges in Europe, but there should be all kinds of economicintegrations.western european countries have agree to form an economic unionby the end of 1992.Sweeping democratic reforms have take hold in East Germany inthe past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests,spurring talk of reunite the two german states divide at the endof World War II. West Germany have propose a plan for greaterunity, but east german leaders reject reunification.the specter of a powerful, reunite Germany have troubed manyPoles, especially the old ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasionof Poland that begin World War II.A report surge in anti-polish sentiment in East Germany inrecent weeks have heighten polish anxieties.Skubiszewski's speech seem design to reassure Poles that thegovernment do not see unification in the near future and willinsist on Poland's current borders.skubiszewski fault west german Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sprogram for gradual German reunification, offer last week, fornot make clear that reunification would respect the existingborder between Poland and East Germany.Some right-wing West german politicians have call forrecovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that Germany lostto Poland at the end of World War II. The territory be aboutone-third of present-day Poland.East Germany and West Germany each separately have recognize theborder, but there have be no official assurance that a reunifiedgermany would also acknowledge the border.one can only unite within establish borders and withoutterritorial arguments, say Skubiszewski.He also say german reunification be unlikely as long as WestGermany belong to NATO and East Germany to the soviet-led WarsawPact military alliance.the Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership metto implement the final solution against Europe's Jewishpopulation will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conferenceon German reunification.the New york-based organization announce Tuesday that themeeting be schedule for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day.The world be expect a jewish statement on reunification,said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.I think that the place where they decide on the `finalsolution' be the right place to have such a meeting, and theanniversary of the victory in Europe seem to be the right day.some 100 members of the World Jewish Congress from about 70countries will attend the conference at the villa in Wannsee,Berlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high german government and partyofficials adopt a plan to exterminate the Jews.Jews have a right to state a moral position on Germanreunification and we will make a moral statement. And part of thatmoral statement be to see that it (the Holocaust) doesn't happenagain, Bronfman said.in the long run, he said, a united Germany can be a verypositive thing for Europe, but certain precautions must be takento prevent a repeat of history. For example, Germany's bordersmust be seal in cement, and the country should not be allowednuclear weapons, he said.bronfman say he do not fear a resurgence of anti-semitismonce the two Germanys be united. In fact, he said, reunificationmight cause a decline in anti-jewish feelings.now that reunification be about to be a fact, they won't beblaming the Jews for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.the conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration ongerman reunification will be issue May 8. It will be the firstmeeting ever hold on german soil by the World Jewish Congress,which be found in 1936 in response to Hitler's threats againstjews.three decades ago, a West Germanpolitician say german reunification be a sleeping lionessthat would awake one day with a mighty roar.now, there be grow speculation the awakening may be at handto create a giant political and economic machine that coulddominate Europe.Reunification be come closer, but I can't say whether itwill take 10, 15 or 20 years, say west german conservativelawmaker Eduard Lintner. We have the impression that things aremuch more concrete than we could have imagine five years ago.the daily sight of thousands of refugees flee East Germanleader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalistwest have revive international interest in the debate.once dismiss as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of Germanreunification have get a public nod from President Bush andsomething short of a categorical no from President Mikhail S.Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.The idea make east german leaders virtually apopletic.if there be a free choice under the present circumstances inthe German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percentto 90 percent would vote for national reunification with thefederal Republic of Germany, add the 44-year-old Lintner in anassociated Press interview.the west german constitution call for a united Germany, but ithas not be a paramount concern of the West Germans in the yearssince the ruins of Nazi Germany be divide into East and West atthe end of World War II.Full national reunification would completey rework the postwareuropean order map out by the conquering Allies. It be aprospect that create unease in Britain and France, and in Polandin the East bloc.london's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 map out apossible scenario that include massive troop reductions in Europe,Honecker's death and further westernization of Poland and Hungary.Moscow unilaterally abolish the Warsaw Pact after guaranteesfrom Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances, theTimes' futuristic view continued. West Germany withdraws fromnato; and a referendum in both East and West Germany vote forreunification and neutrality.That sort of talk be be hear more and more as Moscow loosensits hold on the East bloc and countries like the soviet Union,Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms.the implications of pull down the Berlin Wall and otherbarriers to link the two german states be enormous and, for many,ominous.as much of Western Europe head towards its own unification in1992, the economic center of gravity would be shift even furtherto the german side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.West Germany be already Europe's large export nation, anddespite its many flaws East Germany's economy be the envy of manysoviet bloc neighbors.a unify Germany could become the political focal point of acontinent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts ofthe soviet bloc.older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator AdolfHitler's boasting that he have bring about the unity of thegerman nation.eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and EasternEurope at the french Institute of International Relations, say shebelieves that as far as public opinion there be new sort ofmistrust toward Germany.This new fear of Germany be link to german economic trends.germany be much stronger, much more dynamic than France, sheadded.since West Germany and East Germany be at the front lines oftwo compete alliances, any signs for eventual reunification wouldhave to come from Washington and moscow.during a news conference last week in Montana, Bush say thatreunification be a matter for the Germans to decide.but he added: If that (reunification) be work out betweenthe Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Westerninterests.For his part, Gorbachev evade the issue during a newsconference in Bonn in June, say only, the situation in Europetoday be determine by historical realities.outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have beensharply divide on the issue.in think about the german Question, we ought not to begoverned by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions, wrotecommentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent. The ColdWar be conduct in the name of freedom and, today, if the comingof freedom to East Germany bring a desire for unity which findsits echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who seek great ties to theeast as chancellor in the 1970s, say german unity doesn'tnecessarily mean a single state although he call reunification ahypothesis that cannot be excluded.as talk grow in the West, the positions against reunificationalmost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the countryin near-record numbers. more than 100,000 East Germans be expectedto resettle in West Germany this year, leave a gaping hole in thecommunist nation's work force.little be likely to change in East Germany as long as the77-year-old Honecker and his age comrades stay in power.during a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker call respectfor Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fireand water, Honecker add on the issue of reunification.There be virtually no indications that Honecker's successorswill be incline to democratic reforms, let alone join thecapitalist West.The calls for reunification have already find a sympathetic earamong some leaders of the polish Solidarity movement, in thecountry that suffer some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.after all, the abnormal situation of the german nationovershadows the whole of Polish-German relations, member ofparliament Adam Michnik write on Monday in the pro-solidarity dailynewspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.the renew talk of reunification be recall the nearlyprophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent west german stategovernor who later go on to head the centrist Free DemocraticParty.Reunification be rest in our midst like a sleeping lioness.tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany be try not todisturb her sleep, Maier predict in 1955. The lioness willone day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quipby Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: I lovegermany so much, I'm delight that there be two of them.west german officials and media today praisedsoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for soften his view ongerman reunification and say it could give hope to disheartenedeast Germans.Disgraced former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker wasreleased from prison Tuesday night after justice officialsdetermined he be too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonmentwhile await trial on treason charges.gorbachev say Tuesday in Moscow that he believe one Germanywas likely in the future, but he add that Germans should notdecide this important question on the streets.he refer to the grow number of demonstrations in EastGermany in support of reunification.gorbachev's statement be his most tolerant yet on the subjectof a single Germany, which have be oppose by Communists for morethan 40 years. east german Communists on Tuesday endorse forreunification for the first time.in West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher toldwest german radio that Gorbachev have correctly analyze thesituation and again show his political skill.west german officials and media praise Gorbachev's view asrealistic and describe it as an important sign of hope forEast Germans who have lose faith in their government.communist leaders launch their uphill campaign for March 18parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil theireuropean concept that aim for a united and demilitarizedeurope.party ideologist Peter Brie say the Communists support thetogetherness of the german nation, and urge a thoughtful andmeasured approach to reunification.in an interview with the west german Bild newspaper, partyleader Gregor Gysi complain that the reunification drive ismoving too quickly.asked if the Communists oppose reunification, Gysi tell thenewspaper: No, not at all. This process cannot be stop anymore. But it be irresponsible to do things in such a way now as ifit be possible tomorrow.the reunification issue promise to dominate the electioncampaign that will seat a new leadership in less than seven weeks.increasing numbers of East Germans have demonstrate for unionwith wealthy and prosperous West Germany as their own economytumbles and an exodus of skilled workers continue unchecked.more than 340,000 people flee East Germany last year, havinglost hope that their spartan living conditions would improve. Thedevastating flight have include as many as 2,500 people daily sincejan. 1.The Communists be widely distrust because of corruptionscandals that have surface since the peaceful pro-democracy revoltlast fall, and because they carry the blame for lead EastGermany into its current economic and political crises.the man most blame for the country's problems, Honecker, wasset free after an East Berlin court reject a request that he bekept in prison until his trial in March. He be jail Monday.The court decide that despite the severity of the chargesagainst Honecker, the state of the accused's health do not permitimprisonment, the official ADN news agency reported.a spokesman for Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph promisedthat the investigation against Honecker would proceed.adn say the court act on advice from two doctors who examinedhonecker independently. Honecker, 77, underwent surgery on Jan. 8to remove a malignant kidney tumor.honecker be oust from the leadership on Oct. 18, aftermassive pro-democracy demonstrations. He be expel from thecommunist Party in December and have since be accuse of treasonand abuse his power.president Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet Tuesday witheast German Premier Hans Modrow and appear to be more open towardeventual German reunification.modrow tell reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev do notrule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time didnot venture to set some time limits for that.earlier, the Kremlin chief say any such decisions must includethe four Allied powers and take into account european opinions.the development of events in the world, in East Germany, inthe Soviet Union demand deep consideration and an analyticalapproach to decide this problem, he say in remarks report bythe official news agency Tass.Time itself be act on this process, give it dynamism,gorbachev said. We have to act responsibly and not decide thisimportant question on the streets.tass say Gorbachev emphasize that talks about restructuringrelations between the two Germanys must involve all directlyinterested governments.asked by an east german correspondent about his attitude towardreunification, Gorbachev say the question be not unexpected andthat no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of ask it.however, the english-language Tass translation indicatedgorbachev could have mean there be no doubts about reunificationitself.gorbachev's position be similar to that adopt by Communistsin East Berlin on Tuesday. For the first time, the communistsacknowledged german unity as a long-term goal but say it must beimbedded in the process of overcome Europe's overall divisions.the Soviet Union traditionally have strongly oppose any talk ofgerman reunification, but Gorbachev have soften that position inadopting a policy that have allow radical reform in Eastern Europe.Soviets say the question of german reunification be to bedecided in the future.gorbachev, in comments to reporters after meet FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterate hisview that the existence of two german states be a fact base on theoutcome of World War II.But he added, The present situation be the result of specifichistorical events, a specific historical process on this continent.so, history should decide the future of this continent.i don't think it be a topical question today. A differentapproach may create a situation that would complicate the entireeuropean process, include the relations between the two Germanstates, Gorbachev said.modrow say the two Germanys could work toward confederation inphases with no time limit.he say he agree with Gorbachev that reunification must bedecided not only by East and West Germany, but all of Europe.According to tass, the soviet leader say any action onreunification must not infringe on the interests of either East orwest Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the UnitedStates or the soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free DemocraticParty, a partner in the govern coalition, say Tuesday in Londonthat Gorbachev have adopt a more positive attitude towardgerman reunification.in a tv interview on Britain's Channel 4, he also urgedeconomic union within 18 months as a prelude to full union ofwest and East Germany.Lambsdorff say that because of East Germany's politicalinstability it have only two choices unification or chaos.modrow invite Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to visiteast Germany and they accepted, Tass reported.modrow arrive in Moscow late monday. A Communist, he have movedforward the country's first free elections from May to March 18 andbrought the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then.Sir, The argument for an independent central bank be that it should be freeof party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policywithout regard to national, regional or global interests.whatever policy the Kohl government follow over reunification, it wasbound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures ingermany. As the western german population be now aware, german reunificationneeds a strong, grow west german economy to finance the subsidisation ofeastern Germans' living standards until there be a sustained upswing in theeast - even if at the cost of high german inflation than the Bundesbankwould wish.In Europe as a whole, very high real interest rates threaten to turnrecession into depression. The governments of Europe have be remarkablypatient with the Bundesbank, although it be threaten nearly 10 years ofeuropean effort for great economic and political integration. Surely theremust be compromise of some economic habits to achieve the latter?it be ironic that, just when german reunification present a short-termreason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetarypriorities, accommodate european convergence, Bundesbank intransigence isthreatening the EMU commitment.beyond Europe, the dominant economic forces be strongly disinflationary.but Germany be the one economy which, for reasons of reunification, couldafford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front.yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advise there be nogrounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates. This, despite theunreliability of german money supply data.the german government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetarytargets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployedin Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression.a DM exchange rate adjustment within the ERM be not the answer to theproblems. We need a prolonged low-interest-rate german reunification boom.The european currency bloc be overvalue against the dollar and yen as aresult of Bundesbank interest rate policies. And this be aggravatingrecession.a future european-wide central bank must clearly - like the US FederalReserve - be more accountable in the broad european political and economicinterest.the governments and central banks of Europe and the G7 block - include thekohl administration - should pressurise the Bundesbank, and be prepare toconsider constitutional changes if necessary, to halt this idiocy.howard flight,managing director,guinness FlightGlobal Asset Management,Lighterman's Court,5 Gainsford Street,Tower Bridge,London SE1 2NEHistorians say the world need not fear thatgerman jackboots will echo again on european pavements, but somestill see the rush toward german reunification as a setback astep away from the integration of Europe.For the most part, the historians say an East Germany collapsinginto chaos represent a great threat to stability than a unitedgerman state.the West Germans be move ahead not out of nationalisticfervor, but a perceived need to deal with a crisis, say HenryAshby Turner of Yale, author of The Two Germanies Since 1945.There be no such a thing as indelible national character,turner said.

I think they be optingfor the german card.i hear these days very little about what Gorbachev call `thehouse of Europe,' he said.the result of a dominant uncomfortably strong german state,geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of nationalborders. It could also mean, he said, that american troops mighthave to stay in Europe as a counterweight to Germany.If I have my druthers reunifications would have happen after1992, after the integration of the west german economy into theeconomy of western Europe, say Charles J. Herber of GeorgeWashington University, express similar concern.then there would have be few chances for Germanadventurers, he said.west Germans be aware of their european neighbors' misgivings,said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presentedreunification within the context of european integration. theywanted to avoid arouse fear of a united Germany again dominatingeurope.even if the history do not exist, there would be fears ofthat kind, he said. We're deal not just with rationalcalculation but a whole host of emotional memories.for all that, Breitman said, One Germany be not onlyinevitable, but give the successful record of West Germany overthe last 40 years, my feeling be it be better than have a regimein chaos.the only alternative to reunification, added Turner, be aneast Germany in ruins, a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.He say Germans have no significant interest in territorialrevisions. Those misgivings be misplaced.gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considereda lead historian of the Nazi era, caution that reunification,if mishandled, could prove explosive.While the people of West Europe have get over nationalisticdistrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, hesaid, and fear of Germany be a reality in East Europe and Russia,he said.i don't think the Germans be head for Moscow again, but wehave to give people and the Germans have to give people time tothink this through and get use to it. ... Mishandled,reunification could scare one or the other of the participants intostarting something and scare others and goodness knows where itwould end.gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, say the divisionof Germany have be the basis of a peace settlement which workedpretty well but be abnormal and sooner or later have to becorrected.german reunification, say Craig, give the world the chance tobuild a new international system, one that will prevent the useof international violence.he added, We have to be careful that we don't fall back intothe kind of system that exist before the Second World War, aeurope fill with nations that be suffer various grievances,rivalries, dispute frontiers, drive by what they consider to belegitimate reasons but pit against each other the sort ofthings that give rise to Hitler in 1933.Chancellor Helmut Kohl assuredvisiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that WestGermany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one ofthe senators say Friday.He strongly affirm under no circumstances would a reunifiedgermany be neutral, Sen.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.

54,d062j,"Insurers face the prospect of pay out billions of dollars for damages cause by this week's California earthquake. get a grip on the extent of the damages be prove a far more difficult task than what insurers face after Hurricane Hugo rip through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month. The earthquake's toll, include possible deep structural damage, go far beyond the more easily observe damage from a hurricane, say George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claim division. But investors be bet that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, come so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers. Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks post strong gains. Aetna and other insurers be hire engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage. most insurers already have mobilize their ""catastrophe"" teams to begin process claims from their policyholders in northern California. Since commercial air travel be interrupted, Aetna, base in Hartford, Conn., charter three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then plan for them to drive to the Bay area. About 25 adjusters be dispatch yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks. Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be use as makeshift claims-processing centers. Insurers will be advertise 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the large home and auto insurer in California, believe the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expect to pay out for claims result from Hurricane Hugo. State Farm, base in Bloomington, Ind., be also the large writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California. Earthquake insurance be sell as a separate policy or a specific endorsement ""rider"" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes. State Farm say about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchase earthquake insurance. Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., say about 23% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28% in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage. The Association of California Insurance Companies estimate damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million be insured, it said. Officials from the american Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinate the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be fly to San Francisco today. They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two. Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffer some of the most costly damage. Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapse in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage. Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- have no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repair it probably would have to be pay out of state general operating funds. However, the bridge, which charge a $1 toll each way, do have ""loss of income"" insurance to replace lose revenue if the operation of the bridge be interrupt for more than seven days. That coverage be provide by a syndicate of insurance companies include Fireman's Fund Corp., base in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., base in Philadelphia. earthquake-related claims aren't expect to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole. Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts say the total capital of the industry be likely to be high at year end than it be at midyear. Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways. For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increase the amount of reinsurance they buy. such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, be likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translate into an overall price rise. Reinsurance be protection take out by the insurance firms themselves. ""We be say this be the break point, this be the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace,"" say William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that specialize in the insurance industry. His firm, along with some others, issue new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday. Among the insurance stocks, big gainers include american International Group, up $3.25 to $102.625; General Re Corp., up $2.75 to $86.50; Aetna, up $2.375 to $59.50; and Marsh & McLennan Inc., up $3.125 to $75.875. Still, a few individual companies, most likely small ones, could be devastated. ""i think there be a damned good chance someone be go to hit the skids on this,"" say Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult. He suspect some insurers who have purchase reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance be use up by Hurricane Hugo. British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers be brace for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster. Although it's unclear how much exposure the London market will face, U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage. Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, say this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, cause these rates to soar. The catastrophe losses sustain by insurers this year will probably be the bad on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake spark the Great San Francisco Fire. Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimate that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, include insured losses of $5.8 billion. He be estimate this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, follow about $4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo.The White House be make sure nobody will accuse it of take this crisis lightly. In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides fly into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning. Some of it be necessary to get federal help flow to victims, but some seem design mostly to project an image of a White House in action. Mr. Bush and his aides be accuse of respond too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo strike the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now. So the White House announce that Mr. Bush get his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu. By noon, Mr. Bush have take two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who be in California; make a televised statement of concern; sign a disaster proclamation; receive a write report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visit FEMA headquarters. Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledge that he and his aides be try to head off criticism. On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush say that he hop there would be ""less carping"" about the emergency office's performance this time, add that the agency ""took a hit"" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo. The White House already be talk of Mr. Bush visit the California earthquake site this weekend. He visit the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urge him to do so.most San francisco-area homeowners mayhave to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their ownpockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits fromhigher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts say wednesday.only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowners haveearthquake insurance, which typically require a 10 percentdeductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000home, accord to industry spokesmen.the Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento saidthat in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of thehomes have earthquake insurance.

In addition tohome damage, the companies likely will get claims for automobiledamage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption dueto electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workerscompensation.some estimate that insurers might face bills total $1billion or more from the quake. But industry observers say theydon't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage fromquake-related claims.we don't think any company be go to have problems payingclaims, say Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for theamerican Insurance Association, a washington-based trade group.the insurers actually could benefit.

That's where the story take off.Sam Walton convince Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, totake over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955.Walton say he want to put in about a dozen stores andneeded someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and hisbrother build a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle say in a recentinterview.that's when Bogle find himself in Walton's learn as you gotraining program.i get home at 10 o'clock that night after scrub and waxingthe floor with Sam, Bogle said.inauspicious first impressions be part of the story. In onevideo, David Glass, who succeed Sam Walton as chief executive ofwal-mart in 1988, recall his impressions after attend theopening of the second wal-mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.The first store, at Rogers, open two years earlier.i think to myself this be absolutely the bad discountstore, or retail store, I have ever seen, say Glass, who waspresident of a drugstore chain at the time.and Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recall that whenwalton take his idea of put discount stores in rural areas toben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there just reallydidn't see a future in it.don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and publicaffairs, attribute wal-mart's success to its associates theterm for employees first coin in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Martemployees be partners in the company and to Sam Walton'sleadership and knack for hire the right person at the righttime.at the start of 1990, wal-mart own 1,402 stores, employed272,000 and list sales of $25.8 billion. Sam's Wholesale clubclosed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announce plans toenter the California market.made IN AMERICA: MY STORYBy Sam WaltonDoubleday, Dollars 22.50. 269 pagesbeing an american folk hero be a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot find out.The problem be that the great american public like its boot-strapentrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright. In a country where businesspractices be not overly genteel, this be a tough combination to achieve. Avast media circus, meanwhile, be quick to expose any flaws.sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who diedof cancer in April, negotiate these pitfalls much good than most. When,in 1985, Forbes magazine declare him America's rich entrepreneur, thepaparazzi descend on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupy bychicken farmers, where Walton make his home. What they find be a happilymarried, much-liked billionaire who enjoy quail hunting, breakfast atthe local Holiday Inn, and drive a battered pick-up truck, minus twohub-caps. Folksy be an understatement.since then, some aspects of Wal-Mart's business - its anti-union policies,the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops -have be subject to critical scrutiny. So, to an extent, have the lesswholesome adventures of the four Walton children. But no one have ever beenable to make Sam himself look bad. The bad that have be say be that hewas rather dull.walton be not about to dash anyone's illusions. Readers will either find hisautobiography lash with 'good ol common-sense and a lot of harmless, ifcharming, anecdotes. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makesno excuses: 'I realise this may sound bore to most you,' he write at onestage, 'but one of my best items ever be a mattress pad call a Bedmate .. . .'a few snippets be more revealing about the character. There cannot be manybillionaires who admit that they 'never learn handwrite too well' - andhave the guts to include a photograph which demonstrate the point.meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton apply to his businessis inescapable. In one of many contributions from friends and family, DonSoderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operate officer, tells of find Sam onesaturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysinghis rival's stock. And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when thecouple be on holiday in Italy their luggage vanish while her husband wasoff on a similar scouting mission.but it be David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhapscaptures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best. explain the annualcontest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume produce item' topromote, he recall the time Sam (who usually won) select minnow bucketsfor carry bait. Glass be more happily team with apple juice. 'So Iwould go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . .put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnowbucket. I particularly do it in stores I know (sam) be go to visit. Itdrove him crazy, and he get off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'but the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half thetruth. Sam Walton be a salesman to the core, and seem to have packagedhimself with all the skill that he once apply to sell a gooey southernsweet call Moon Pies.For the most part, this make for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.occasionally, it just grates. 'I have buy a bank in Bentonville, for aboutabout Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, 'just a little old bankwith only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits. But it help me learn a lot aboutfinancing things.' Oh, come on Sam, be that the whole story?the real truth, one suspects, come right at the end of the book - whenwalton admit that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have writtenthis book'. Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday pay about Dollars4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, hecan hardly be blame for agree to write it. But these be unlikely to becircumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis. At the end ofthe day, Sam Walton's heritage be in the shopping malls, not the bookstores.the store manager of the Wal-Mart in thiscommunity on the outskirts of Dallas tell a story that give aninsight into the man consider responsible for a retailingphenomenon.manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretarytelephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters inbentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton be about to land at a nearbyairport and the secretary ask if someone could fetch him and bringhim to the De Soto store.paying unexpected calls on stores be one way Walton have keep inclose touch with everyday goings-on. His example be follow byother Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spend a lot oftime in the field.Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallasmetropolitan area, It's not like `uh-oh, someone's coming,'because they're always out.By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeate operationsthroughout the company.everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating OfficerDavid Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote thegospel accord to Sam, as he be called.to paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing, Rule No.1 isthe customer be always right. Rule No.2 say just in case thecustomer's wrong, revert to rule No.1.If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they arebecause that's the way Sam is, people who know him say.he shun the limelight that his company's success have shed on himand have decide to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.he's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.he also regularly remind wal-mart associates thathospitality to customers be crucial. He preach it in person or viahigh-tech satellite hookup with his stores.wal-mart employees become know as associates under a companyeffort to prove it care about employees, partly to thwart a unionorganizing effort in the late 1960s.One of the most sensitive subjects for Walton be the fortune he'samassed.a close associate say Sam would probably give anything notto be name on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiestpeople. The magazine have estimate that his immediate family's stakein Wal-Mart stock be worth about $6.8 billion.sam Walton be more interested in his backhand than he be in hisbank account, say Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.samuel Moore Walton turn 71 on March 29. He be bear inkingfisher, Okla., and grow up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker.he graduate from the University of Missouri with an economicsdegree in 1940 and join J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee indes Moines, Iowa. After serve three years in the Army, he go toarkansas and open a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventuallybecoming the company's big franchisee.the seeds of the Wal-Mart empire be sow when Sam and hisbrother James L., or Bud, open the first wal-mart Discount City in1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S.retail trade.bud be a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.Three of the four grown children Sam and his wife Helen have areinvolved with the company in various capacities.sam hasn't slow much, enjoy hunting and tennis as much asever, and be say not to suffer after effects from a bout withleukemia, now in remission. He spend less time in the office sincehanding over most responsiblities to David Glass. Sam be stillchairman of the board.glass doesn't hesitate when ask if Wal-Mart can flourishwithout Sam. The answer be an emphatic yes because, he says, Wehave great people. The Walton family will always be involved, headds.commenting on the future, Glass says: We'll be judge on whatwe produce today. Tomorrow, what we've do in the past won'tmatter.wal-mart founder Sam Waltonpitched in to help check-out clerks at his store in this FloridaPanhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cashregisters.the 71-year-old Walton, consider to be one of the world'srichest people, grab a note pad Tuesday evening and startedhand-writing merchandise prices for customers so their bills couldbe tally on calculators quickly.people begin recognize him and come up and greet him,said store manager Paul Sively.

The church-goingson of a farmer bear in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he found a storechain which make him America's richest man, and which, shortly before hisdeath in 1992, become the world's big retailer.his company, Wal-Mart, make sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and afterwalton's death Fortune magazine report that his wife and four childrenheld between them the second-largest fortune in the world - dollars 23.5bn.What be most startling about Wal-Mart be the speed of its growth. AlthoughWalton build up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchise from1945, it be not until 1962 that he open his first wal-mart discountstore.at the time of its incorporation in 1971, wal-mart have only 38 outlets withsales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal DiscountMerchandiser's list of the 71 big US discount retailers. Ten yearslater, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it be only the 33rd-biggestretailer in the US. Its turnover be only 9 per cent of that of SearsRoebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest. Withinanother 10 years, Wal-Mart have overtake them both.apart from Walton's autobiography complete shortly before his death,however, publish material about the company be curiously scarce. This bookattempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise ofwal-mart, set it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaininghow it be achieved.one strength the authors identify be wal-mart's ability to copy and adaptfrom other retailers.sam Walton do not invent discount retailing. Rather, he realise the threatdiscounting pose to his own variety store business and study in depthmany of the US's lead discounters of the early 1960s, include Ann andhope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.Walton learn from them all, but be unique in take his discount storesinto small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers use to travellinglong distances be delight to have a cut-price store nearby sellingeverything they needed.Another strength be wal-mart's openness to technology. as early as the1950s, Walton realise he be waste too much time travel and buy asmall aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continue todo to the end of his life.sometimes, Walton be more reluctant to invest in technology, and have to bepersuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scan at check-outs -long before most retailers have recognise their importance - and to investdollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system. This technologyhelped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of anyretailer. But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the booksuggests, have be Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive managementstructure.regional vice-presidents base at group headquarters in Bentonville,Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, be despatch everymonday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visit stores, workingwith staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meetingevery Friday.They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30ammeeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers torelate the results. District managers hold a conference call with theirstore managers, and before the day be out, the contents of the meeting havebeen communicate to all store department heads.the system mean employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one weekand, if the idea be accept by the Saturday meeting, see its implementationbegin the follow week.even the world's most successful retailer make mistakes, however. One waswalton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's rolein 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976after finding he be incapable of let go of the reins. Another waswal-mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which prove too big even forgigantist America.Then there be Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street ifwal-mart achieve an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984. It did, andhe did.the book also cover well the debate over whether wal-mart's impact on theeconomies of small US towns be positive or negative.if there be criticisms, these be that this 'scholarly account' never quitecaptures the sheer excitement of work in the world's fastest-growingretailer. Moreover, it make little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart cancontinue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way itconquered the US.But this be a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success inbuilding his own american dream.he's rank as the rich man in thenation by a lead business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville,a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton be just another neighbor.he's just a part of the community, say Curt Loyd, executivedirector of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce. He's a neatperson. He call Bentonville home, and that be special to us.walton, who prefer bird-hunting, tennis and open new Wal-Martstores to trumpet his personal financial holdings, be againshunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among theworld's top billionaires. accord to Forbes magazine's July 24edition, the Walton family's estimate worth be $8.7 billion, upfrom its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.he be unavailable, say Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of thesilver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain,based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.Shinkle say he receive about 10 calls from reporters Mondaymorning, when the Forbes list appear in newspapers. Shinkle saidnews coverage about Walton usually set off a press frenzy forcomments from him. But the 71-year-old businessman decline tocomment.he feels any attention to Sam Walton be to the individual andhe prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,shinkle said.he very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings. It justputs him in a position he doesn't want to be.but Walton occasionally offer peeks that reveal personalmodesty. Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which walton'sfamily-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lose millions in value, hequipped in response to questions at a news conference on anothertopic that it be only paper. Walton then change the subject.walton be first list by Forbes as the nation's richest man inoctober 1985. Three years ago, Forbes also begin list the world'swealthiest people. Walton make that listing as the rich americanevery year since. This year he rank third, behind two Japanesebusinessmen.Shinkle say Walton stay busy visit many of the more than1,400 stores operate by the company he start as a singlefive-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago. He be out of theoffice up to four days a week, the spokesman said.he spend most of his time talk to associates andcustomers, Shinkle said, and he always come back with manyideas from them.wal-mart calls its sales help associates instead of employees.when Walton first make the Forbes list of rich americans,recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, call come infrom all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.They want to know about the stock and the company, saidsimpson, who work for Stephens Inc. You'd think that he'd beliving in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas. But now peoplejust accept it.when it come out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,'simpson said.

Because the reinsuranceof reinsurance risk - know as the retrocession market - have shrunkconsiderably in recent years, US insurers have place far few of theirrisks through Lloyd's.Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, say he estimatedthat mainline UK insurers face no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims sofar.'at the moment we be relax about it,' he said. The real question, headded, be the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters.royal Insurance estimate the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m.Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimate that General Accident may facelosses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange face Pounds 5mand Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each.however, Hurricane Andrew gather fresh strength as it move across thegulf of Mexico and there be concern last night that it might head towardsnew Orleans, which be especially low lying and could suffer severe flooddamage.Scientists say the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabamaport of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night orearly Thursday.It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil productionfacilities in the Gulf of Mexico.

It have a branch inorlando.the company's loss adjusters be in the area try to estimate the losses.their guess be that losses to be face by all insurers may total more thanDollars 8bn.Not all damage property in the area be insure and there have beenestimates that the storm cause more than Dollars 20bn of damage.however, other insurers have estimate that losses could be as low asDollars 1bn in total.mr Robertson said: 'No one know at this time what the exact loss is'.while Hurricane Andrew be wreak havoc across large parts of southernflorida and Louisiana this week, a grade two dollar crisis (on a one-to-fourscale, four be most severe) be blow itself out at the end of atumultuous few days for US and world financial markets.on Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm be inflict aweek ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yields jump sharplyand the Dow Jones industrial average plunge by more than 75 points.the flimsy walls erect hastily by the Federal Reserve and other bigcentral banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of sellingon foreign exchange markets fail to hold; and as the sellers pouredthrough the breach barricades, the currency drop to dm1.40. This wasits lowest-ever point against the d-mark.the conditions necessary for a dollar crisis have be build up incurrency markets for some time. Interest rate differentials between US andgermany widen over the summer as the Fed eased, and the Bundesbanktightened, their respective monetary policies.the failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour wasalso make overseas investors increasingly unhappy about hold thedollar.so, too, be the political hole President Bush have dig for himself in are-election battle that only a year ago be suppose to be a shoo-in for theincumbent.moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt be in themarkets try to prop up the dollar serve only to convince foreignexchange dealers that the currency be head in one direction - down.while there be plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar, thelogic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets wasless obviously compelling.there be two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices tofall. The first be that it raise import prices and, as a result, add toinflationary pressures.the second be that it make it hard for the Fed to engineer another cut ininterest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery, and raise thepossibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency.the first explanation be not particularly convince - imports account fornot much more than 10 per cent of US gross domestic product, so higherimport prices do not greatly effect the overall price level, which be nowaround 3 per cent and head lower.the second explanation carry more weight. Although there be not muchchance, give the present economic and political climate, that the Fed willraise rates to help the dollar, there be little doubt that the currency'sweakness make it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policyagain.The fear that the Fed may be do with interest rate cuts for the presenteconomic cycle be also behind the selling in equity markets. But investorsin stocks be equally, if not more, trouble by the rise in bond yields.just over a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which hasremained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy,looked as if it might drop below 7.3 per cent.the dollar put pay to those hopes and, by the middle of this week, it wasapproaching 7.45 per cent, put an upward pressure on the all-importantmortgage rate for home-buyers.the dollar be not the only story in financial markets this week, and thedevastating effect of Hurricane Andrew produce a typically hard-eyed,although nonetheless logical, reaction from Wall Street.The stocks of those insurance companies with the great exposure insouthern Florida, the area hit worst by the hurricane, all take a tumble.but the relatively modest losses in Geico, Travelers and progressivesuggested that the market believe the insurers be reserve or reinsuredadequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims.The flip side of the hurricane's coin be a strong showing from the stocksof home construction companies expect to benefit from demand forrebuilding damage or destroy homes. Since there be an estimated 250,000people leave homeless by the storm, there be a lot of work to be done.the big gains among construction stocks this week be post by Lennar,Oakwood Homes, Engle Homes and Fleetwood, the large maker ofpre-manufactured homes in the US.

Miracles do happen, he tell his party.dan Quayle have not yet be nominate forvice president and already Republicans be compare him to ThomasJefferson and John F. Kennedy.Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who serve with Quayle on a Senatesubcommittee, tell an audience that whenever he hear the Indianasenator speak, I'd say, `there stand the next ThomasJefferson.'And, add Warner, he do have the same fire in his belly asour great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.Former president Gerald Ford make the comparison with Kennedy, ademocrat.in 1960, the american people vote for John F. Kennedy forpresident and he be the relatively same age as Dan Quayle, saidford. John Kennedy have be in the House and Senate 14 yearsbefore he be elect president and Dan Quayle's have 12 years.what quayle thinks of those references isn't known. But hedoesn't like it when people say he look like movie idol RobertRedford.Whether, indeed, he look like Redford seem to be in the eye ofthe beholder. In the parlance of politics, it's an issue. They areboth male. They be both blond.the so-called resemblance become a point of contention in the1980 Senate race and Redford take umbrage. The actor, who onceplayed the role of a presidential office seeker in TheCandidate send Quayle a telegram tell him to stop thelook-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.quayle say the news media have make the comparison, not he, andafter he be elect sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.and this week, he tell reporters he consider the so-calledredford look a stigma. He wasn't ask how he felt about beingpainted as another Jefferson or Kennedy.Meanwhile, fellow senators be try to publicize Quayle who,at 41, hasn't have a chance to become a legend. He be a Republicanvice presidential candidate who be not, as Spiro Agnew once say ofhimself, a household word.to help him get known, eight fellow senators Wednesday tookturns tell reporters how much they like him.We know him well, say Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive becauseof his enthusiasm, say Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 years of age, he's goingto send a message to the american people that the Republican Partyrespects young people who achieve, say Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senators say that should nothold him back.let's not start this business of who's wealthy, Sen. AlfonseD'Amato, R-N.Y.Dan Quayle's sister believe the Indianasenator won't let his candidacy for vice president hurt the familylife he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy.i don't think it will be tough on the family, say MarthaSaddler, Quayle's sister, who live in Huntington, Ind. Sincehe's be in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hecticschedule and wonder how he do it. But he do it and love it.the Quayle family and friends be celebrate Tuesday afternoonafter George Bush announce he want the 41-year-old Indianasenator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.those who have know the Quayles for years say the senator andhis wife have remain relatively unchanged by their years inpublic life.dan and Marilyn Quayle meet as law students in Indianapolis,married while they be still in school and remain close to many oftheir friends from that period.one of the great things about him be the job of be asenator have not change him a bit, say Indianapolis attorneywilliam R. Neale, treasurer of Quayle's 1986 re-election campaign.he's the same nice guy he be in law school.neale, who grow up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis,introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gather atthe Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.Dan quayle, who grow up in Huntington, graduate from DePauwUniversity, a small liberal arts college in Greencastle, Ind.,before go to work in the Indiana attorney general's office in1970.daniel F. Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, saidhe doesn't expect Quayle's national candidacy to change him.i think his strength be he'll remember who his friends areeven after this, say Evans, who be chairman of Quayle's 1986campaign.Friends say the Quayles be devote to their three children andprefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in Washington.His family look like the family both parties be try toappeal to, say Mitch Daniels, former political chief in thewhite House and now president of the Hudson Institute. It's abeautiful family. I think they'll be a real asset.the couple, who marry in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker;a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne.When they campaign in Indiana, the Quayles often tour in twogroups the boys rid in parades with Marilyn Quayle and Corinneand her father visit county fairs.the kids be nonchalant, normal kids, say Mrs. Saddler.They take it in stride and play.in an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles saidthey have worry during the vice presidential speculation about thefamily's loss of privacy during a national campaign.the total lack of privacy be go to be the big minus,said Mrs. Quayle, 39.Quayle say he have question each of his children about whetherhe should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offer it.tucker be fascinate by the idea, Quayle said. Benjamin wasambiguous but he think Secret Service agents might be able tohelp him on tests at school, Mrs. Quayle said.corinne didn't like the prospect of have her father spend moretime away from home, Quayle said.she tell me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush pick BobDole,' say Quayle.Here be a transcript of the speech by Sen.Bob Dole of Kansas nominate Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vicepresident at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.Thank you. Thank you.Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I be herefor the purpose of nominate the next vice president of the UnitedStates.We be here to nominate one of the bright young lights in therepublican Party, a man I be proud to say be my colleague, thejunior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.You know, senators get a lot of mail. Party leaders more thanmost. And almost every one of these letters ask for help with someproblem.well, three years ago, I receive a handwritten plea from a6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senatesessions have a very special problem.she wrote, and I quote: I have my second-grade play tonight.please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me.i know Corinne Quayle be from a political family because sheinvited me to come along, too.corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother,marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the UnitedStates Senate.Dan Quayle be a dedicated public servant and a devoted familyman.and whenever I need him, whenever I need him, Dan be there ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the toughvotes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into thelaw of the land.whether it be the budget or defense, tax reform or the INFtreaty, Dan Quayle be there, a forceful advocate, and a staunchsupporter of the Reagan revolution. And now he be ready to carrythat revolution forward.and believe me he be ready, and just let the Democrats try touse experience as a measure stick in this campaign. Just let themtry.now, I don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacksexperience. He's get plenty of experience, plenty of experience experience in raise taxes again and again, experience in vetoingthe pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience inincreasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts.And I just don't believe the american people want that kind ofexperience in the White House.It sound like a dukak-eyed idea to me.but Dan Quayle's get experience, too. He's already spend 12years as a congressman and a senator, tackle the vital nationaland international issues that affect the lives of all Americans andthe future of our country.that be 12 more years of national experience than MichaelDukakis and he be run for president.as I say at the start, Dan Quayle be a man I know and trust. Iam honor to nominate him for vice president, Mr. Chairman.And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of mytime to the outstanding, distinguish senior from Indiana, my goodfriend, Sen. Dick Lugar.He be the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even asthe world consider his fitness for the presidency, Huntington be celebratinghis life in what be ambitiously be bill as the Premiere Dan QuayleMemorabilia Exhibit.; To those who say Quayle do not merit his ownexhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that heis, after all, the vice president of the United States.; ""We're preservinghistory,"" say David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator. ""a century from nowsomeone may want to do a dissertation on him.""; If so, Huntington will beready.; Relatives, former classmates and longtime neighbors of Quayle havedonated yearbooks, report cards, poems, letters, his little League uniform, acoffee cup he drink from, a chair he once stand on during the 1988presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched, wrote,signed or pose for.; The vice president's mother, Corinne, donate a lockof his baby hair. The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produce a picture ofQuayle, then an aide to Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb, accompany her to therace. And a former housekeeper turn in a 20-year-old piece of carpet shesaved from one of Quayle's floors.; The exhibition, which run through May20, be put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation, a sort offan-club-turned-archive devote to document the life and times of thenation's 44th and, they say, least-understood vice president.; ""He hastaken such a bad rap,"" say Schenkel, a foundation board member. ""If peopleknew him, they'd see he's a regular person. If they have a chance to sit downwith Dan as a neighbor, they would see the extremely good values in the man."";these be the faithful, who have long since stop expect ""good press""on their man. instead they measure news reports on him by their relativenegativity, describe the best coverage as ""more upbeat"" or ""halfwaydecent.""; They defend the relatively young age of Quayle, who turn 44 infebruary (""all he need be a little seasoning""); his limited experience (""lookat what they say about Truman -- he be a haberdasher""), and his passion forgolf (""he have to have some form of relaxation""). But they be careful not tostretch the superlatives. The description ""nice"" come up a lot.; ""he's notthe fool that the talk show host think he is,"" say Dottie Watson, presidentof the republican Women of Huntington County. ""he's a very nice person, acapable person. everybody I know say he can do it.""; That be not to saysome people don't have some friendly advice for Quayle. ""If he would slowdown, talk an octave low and think about what he's saying, I don't thinkpeople would take him the way they do,"" say Jean Anne Drabenstot, the ownerof Nick's Kitchen, Quayle's favorite restaurant.; Hayden Schenkel, chairmanof the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of DavidSchenkel, says, ""some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentallybecame president of the United States. Most of the Democrats and even some ofthe Republicans would say they're tickle to death to have him as vicepresident, and they're 100 percent behind him. But in all due respect, we surehope nothing happens to President Bush.""; Quayle have decline an invitationto attend the tribute, cite a busy schedule. Nonetheless, most ofhuntington's 17,000 residents have rally around their native son for theexhibition, which track his life from infancy through law school, from thesenate to the vice presidency.; The free exhibition have turn a gray roomin the town's public library into a virtual Dan Quayle museum.

It be all very 50s, very Middle American, almostsurreal in its innocence.; There be windows into the workings of thequayle family, too. For example, his father, James, sign the report cardswhen Dan bring home poor grades, and his mother sign when he bring homegood ones.; And there be letters and poems that he wrote, which only go toshow that one do not have to be a Yeats to make it in politics. Dan wrotethis rather thoughtful verse on Nov. 22, 1960, when he be 13 years old:;my Dad be very very nice; But he be not make of sugar and spice.;sometimes he act as if he have be disturbed; But at other times he be ascheerful as a bird.; The exhibit also include the 1972 newspaperannouncement of Dan and Marilyn Quayle's wedding, the wooden ""quayle & Quayle""shingle the couple hung when they open their law practice here, and assortedcampaign souvenirs, include the official air sickness bag from the 1988republican National Convention.; Ultimately, the foundation want to builda repository for the memorabilia. It have already organize a walk tour ofhistoric Quayle sites, like the white, ranch-style house where he spend hisearly days, and Nick's Kitchen, where he like to order tenderloins, fries anda milkshake.; ""We want everybody to know he's a winner -- I don't care whatthe newspapers say,"" say Marge Hiner, one of the exhibit organizers. ""What arole model for our children, to know that you can be a normal person, comefrom a normal family and become vice president of the United States.""Republican vice presidential candidate DanQuayle's official resume say he be the Indiana ConsumerProtection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit wascreated, state records show.the law create the unit pass April 14, 1971, and take effectjuly 1.

Whitcomb.Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign be use as hisofficial background, say he be chief investigator of the unit inthe Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.He be assign to our section in the spring of 1971, saidrobert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney inindianapolis.he be in fact the chief investigator. He help get the unitset up. (but) it would not have be before 1971, Smith saidfriday in a telephone interview. We formally begin operationsjuly 1.Quayle concede Friday that the resume entry be inaccurateand say his staff have write the document.if it indicate that, that be inaccurate. I didn't hold thatjob for two years, Quayle tell reporters aboard his campaignplane.earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi call therevelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland a cheapshot.quayle be hire as an entry-level research assistant by thestate Attorney General's office in 1970 after he return from sixmonths of basic and advanced training for the Indiana NationalGuard.Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, be attendingindiana University Law School at the time.m. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News,helped arrange his job interview with the state. Evans work foreugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher of the News.At no point in any of this do Dan Quayle ask any favors oruse any influence, say Evans, now with the National JournalismCenter in Washington, D.C.He wouldn't have be hire as a chief investigator. He washired in an entry-level job and be promote to a whole bunch ofjobs on his merits. It's a nothing story, Evans said.theodore sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently hadsurgery and be unable to comment, accord to his son, TimothySendak.Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who be then anassistant attorney general, say Friday that prior to theestablishment of the Consumer Protection Division, all complaintsand inquiries be handle by me. The legal assistant assign tome and utilized as my chief investigator be Dan Quayle. Herstatement be release by the Quayle campaign.the Consumer Protection Division be create by the statelegislature to resolve complaints over defective products, falseclaims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud.in 1980, Quayle refer to himself as a Vietnam-era veteranin campaign literature when he be run against three-termincumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race.quayle, who enlist in the Indiana National Guard, drop thereference after objections by some Vietnam combat veterans.in that same election, which he won, Quayle say he be onactive duty for several periods during his tenure in the Guard.The statement refer to periods when Quayle be in basic trainingand 15 days of camp each summer.dan Quayle be likely to be a man on theoutside in George Bush's White House follow a vice presidentialcandidacy that begin in a furor but settle into obscurity, expertssay.encumbered by his image as a political novice who need a bevyof professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies,quayle enters a Bush administration in which he have few intimates orallies.relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas,quayle as vice president be likely to be give a traditionalceremonial role go to political gatherings and state funerals rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had,some scholars feel.dan Quayle be go to set the vice presidency back about adecade or more. One thing that political scientists have beentalking about be just how much the vice presidency have grown. ...With Quayle, it's just go to retreat to the old days of politicsand funerals, say Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of politicalscience at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies theamerican presidency.bush rarely mention his 41-year-old running mate during thecampaign. When asked, Bush employ the stock lines that Quaylewould make an outstanding vice president and have be temperedby steel as he weather the early furor over his militaryservice, academic record and personal life.the president-elect tell reporters Quayle would have access tothe same papers, information and intelligence that be available tothe president. But he would go no far in describe whatassignments he would give Quayle.Quayle say Bush have talk to him about head a space council,and that he assume he'll have a role in the administration'santi-drug efforts. I will be a very close adviser to thepresident, Quayle said.but that's not the way everyone see it.both Bush and Mondale come to their vice presidential campaignswith substantial reputations and be able to place key staffers inimportant positions in the respective presidential campaigns,barilleaux notes.dan Quayle have contribute nothing in the way of staff to thebush campaign. He doesn't have his own big reputation on CapitolHill. ... Dan Quayle have no friends in a Bush White House exceptgeorge Bush, Barilleaux says.they're go to give him a lot of window dressing, a spacecouncil, drug task force, but he's go to be a man on the outside... not a man who's go to be consult in a crisis, except on apro forma basis.but Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who work with the Bushcampaign, say Bush be likely to give quayle a more active role inthe administration than he have in the campaign.vindication demand that. Both of them will want to prove howright the decision was, Mahe says.democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight,a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested andunqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Even somemembers of Quayle's own party be dismay at Bush's choice.quayle didn't help his case by make a number of celebratedgaffes during the campaign, perhaps the bad be his garbledexplanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, I didn't live inthis century.norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, saysquayle, while not the world's lead intellectual, be not acomplete dummy. He be simply thrust into a situation for which hewas unprepared, Ornstein says.i think he's immature. He's not stupid, Ornstein says.but Quayle come to the White House with a very damagingstereotype that's develop about him that's widely believe in thepolitical community and that's believe by a large segment of theelectorate, Ornstein says.that's go to give him a good deal to overcome. It's go togive him an enormous impetus to prove himself. That's go to bedifficult, give the office.both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution seeparallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon andspiro Agnew. The choice of Nixon be view as a move by DwightEisenhower to appease the party's right wing, and Agnew be see asa political nonentity.the natural response be to use him (quayle) sparingly, as Nixondid with Agnew in 1968, Hess says. However, Quayle have fouryears to prove himself, and I think you're go to see stories intwo years about how much he's learned, how much he's actedresponsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988.Quayle admits the campaign be a learning process. After thecontroversies subsided, Quayle declare his independence from hisbush handlers, say he would be his own man. He become moreaccessible to the media but continue to adhere to the schedulehanded down from Washington and to deliver the party's scriptedmessage. Soon, he drop off the front pages.and although he occasionally speak out in frustration at havinglittle control over his schedule and at cease to make nationalnews, he play the role of loyal no. 2 and even trumpet his newanonymity.we have arrive as be a traditional vice presidentialnominee because we be either on the back pages or either not on thepages at all. That's what we're suppose to be, he tell reporters.That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in abush White House, Mahe feels, since Bush want a private adviser,whose experience and opinion he respect ... (who) have never hadanother agenda.dan Quayle owe his political life to one man and one manalone, Mahe says. You're never go to see Dan Quayle tellingtales out of school.
