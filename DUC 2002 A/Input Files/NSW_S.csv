There it successfully released the $1.5 billion dollar Hubble Space Telescope from its cargo bay.  Now in the process of overcoming some start-up problems, the telescope should soon be operational.","The shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth, it will provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled.  Once released, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  However, scientists, optimistic that the Hubble will soon be operational, authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return home.","Following an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  Named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who did pioneering work leading to the ""Big Bang"" concept of the universe, it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime, it will provide astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.  The telescope was placed on special flight modes until these start-up problems are resolved.  Confident that the Hubble will soon be operational, the shuttle Discovery is preparing to return home.","Discovery carries $1.5 billion Hubble Telescope to space April 24, 1990","On April 24, 1990, shuttle Discovery carried the Hubble Space Telescope 380 miles into space, then followed briefly to assist if necessary. In orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere for 15 years, Hubble would see 10 times better than Earth telescopes. Hubble's launch had been delayed since 1983.

Once in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere, Hubble would be able to see 10 times better than the largest Earth telescopes. Wednesday it was lifted into space by Discovery's mechanical arm and released into orbit. Friday the 94.5-inch mirror was exposed to starlight. Saturday controllers took Hubble out of safe mode. Problems with a solar power array, communications antennas, and two position-stabilizing gyroscopes -- exacerbated by conservative limits set on systems -- put Hubble several days behind schedule and delayed transmittal of the first photograph. Discovery's astronauts -- Shriver, Bolden, Hawley, McCandless, and Sullivan - - were all veterans of previous flights. The shuttle followed Hubble for two days to assist if necessary. A seven-month checkout period would follow. Spacelab Astro was to be put up two weeks later to give Hubble additional target information. Hubble, delayed since 1983, cost $1.5 billion. Spare parts, training, and software cost $500 million more. Maintenance cost $7 million a month on Earth and will cost $200 million yearly in orbit, for Hubble's 15-year lifetime.

By March 10 the BSE index sunk to a 13-month low at 2,287. On March 12 a coordinated bomb attack against targets in Bombay including the BSE killed at least 255 people and injured 1,200 threatening a resumption of Hindu-Moslem rioting which had occurred earlier. The BSE reopened on March 15, but on March 16 an explosion in Calcutta killed at least 45. Despite the tragedies and threat of war or rioting, the BSE index had climbed up as far as 2,409.23 by March 17.","In March of 1993 the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) experienced a series of shocks, but emerged on the upbeat. The first blow was reaction to a report from the Indian finance minister on February 27 postponing corporate tax reform. Disappointed with the postponement, traders sold with a vengeance driving equity prices to a 13-month low with the BSE index down to 2,287 on March 10 compared to 2,893 on February 27. Then the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accused the BSE of violating regulations limiting speculative investments. On the night of March 12 the BSE was damaged as thirteen bombs exploded in Bombay killing at least 255 people, injuring over 1,200 and threatening resumption of intercommunal riots between Hindus and Moslems. Despite structural damage, the BSE reopened on March 15. On March 16 an explosion in a residential district of Calcutta killed at least 45. A Sikh group claimed responsibility but official Indian comments implied that Pakistan was the main suspect. With the looming threat of riots and war, the BSE index rose by 2.1 per cent on March 15 and even after the Calcutta bombing settled at 2,409.23 on March 17, a marked improvement over the March 10 reading.",Bombay Stock Exchange fights for equilibrium through bombs and investigations.,"The Bombay Stock Exchange has suffered a week of onslaught but remains open.

First the Securities and Exchange Board of India accused the market of ignoring and failing to enforce rules.

On Friday afternoon, India's commercial heart, including the BSE, was hit with car bombs.

The BSE was able to resume limited trading, but a slight rise was halted by an explosion Wednesday in Calcutta.","The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) remains open following a week of onslaught.  Last week, the Securities and Exchange Board of India completed its first inspection of the books and accused the market of ignoring and failing to enforce rules.  This is just the latest dispute between the government and the troubled BSE.  The Indian market already had fallen 48 percent since early last year, aggravated by a negative reaction to the Indian budget, which helped foreign and expatriate investors, but did not provide the expected tax relief to local industry.  On Friday afternoon, the BSE, along with other Bombay commercial centers, was hit with car bombs.  These attacks struck at the heart of India's commerce, seemingly aimed at undermining government efforts to expand foreign investment and tourism.  While a militant Sikh group claimed responsibility, Indian officials still suspect Moslem extremists, maybe with Pakistani help, seeking revenge for the December 1992 destruction of a mosque in northern India.  The BSE was able to resume limited trading on Monday and the index rose for two days.  This rise was halted by an explosion Wednesday, which killed 45 and injured a score in a central Calcutta apartment complex.  Fears abound that communal strife will return.",,,,

Though he won the 1992 general election, the high-school dropout is now accused of being a weak leader, incompetent on both domestic and international issues.","On Easter Sunday, three Cabinet ministers issued statements on behalf of  Prime Minister John Major amidst speculation that he could be forced out this autumn. In May local elections across Britain, however, the Conservatives loss 444 seats, and word circulated that Major was not up to the job.Major became leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister after his mentor, Margaret Thatcher resigned under pressure in 1990. Though he won the 1992 general election, the lingering recession and controversies involving European community issues splintered the Tories. He came to be viewed as a weak, vacillating leader, lacking political conviction.","In early May elections across Britain, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing 444 seats. One editorial claims some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major, and there is speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher when she resigned under pressure in November 1990. After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift. Major's comment while visiting America a month later that Iraqi troops might have to be ""forcibly removed"" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard-line on the Persian Gulf.Within a year of winning the general election, his popularity had plunged. In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015 the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Though Major's personal style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak leader, lacking vision and political conviction. Not even recent revelations that Major uses salty language can alter his wimp image.","John Major elected leader of Conservative Party, becomes next Prime Minister.","John Major emerged victorious in an election for leadership of the Conservative Party and became, at 47, Britain's youngest prime minister. His popularity began to decline very soon after his election and he is viewed and weak and indecisive. Having reneged on campaign promises, he is blamed for the recession which plagues Britain.","At 47, John Major became Britain's youngest prime minister. His accession to power followed the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following a challenge by former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine to her leadership. Major fell two votes shy of a victory in an election with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Heseltine but both opponents quickly conceded to Major. Since his election, Major has been seen as weak and indecisive. He is an unpopular leader whose cabinet has been rocked by scandal and who reneged on campaign promises. Adding to his unpopularity is the recession which continues plague Britain.","John Major was 47 when he was elected to lead the Conservative Party. Assuming the position of prime Minister from Margaret, Mr. Major became the youngest prime minister since the 19th century. Mr. Major was confirmed as leader of the Conservative Party when his two opponents, former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, conceded defeat in an election which saw Major two votes shy of a majority. Major, whose father was a trapeze artist in the circus, overcame many obstacles in his rise to the top. He was a high school drop out and for a time was a welfare recipient. Mr. Major had little time to enjoy his victory as public opinion of him soon soured. While seen as gentler than his abrasive predecessor, he is viewed as timid and indecisive. Almost from the first he has been beset by scandal in his cabinet and a number of controversies ranging from internal party differences over Europe to the debacle surrounding Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System to a deep and continuing recession. Major came out in strong support of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, calling on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait.",,,,

government battles Muslim insurgents in Jammu-Kashmir on Pakistani border.,"The Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir is the scene of continuing violence between the government and Muslim insurgents who are seeking to establish an independent nation.  More the 1,000 have been killed since January.  Since 1947, predominately Islamic Pakistan and Hindu-majority India have fought twice over this Muslim-majority region.","The Indian government has been fighting Muslim insurgents in the state of Jammu-Kashmir for the last seven months.  More than 1,000 people have been killed.  India (predominately Hindu) and Pakistan (predominately Islamic) have fought two wars over Kashmir since the nations were established in 1947.  Jammu-Kashmir is 62 percent Muslim and the insurgents want an independent nation.  Violence is occurring primarily near Srinagar, the capital, and along the border with Pakistan.  India claims the insurgents are being trained and armed in Pakistan.  Pakistan denies these charges.  The two nations recently exchanged fire, but both say there is no cause for concern.","Fighting has broken out sporadically in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir since January 20.  At least 1,034 people had been killed by late August.  The Indian government is battling Muslim insurgents seeking the formation of an independent, neutral, nation.  India (predominately Hindu) and Pakistan (predominately Islamic) have fought two wars over Kashmir since the nations were established in 1947.  Jammu-Kashmir is 62 percent Muslim.  Insurgent tactics have included bombings, kidnappings, killings of suspected police informers, ambushes of police vehicles, and attacks on police installations.  Large demonstrations have been held in Jammu-Kashmir and on the Pakistani border.  Indian tactics have include retaliatory fire, arresting and killing insurgent leaders, 24-hour curfews, disrupting and firing on demonstrations, and interfering with funerals of dead insurgents.  The state is now governed directly from New Delhi.In August, India increased border forces and operations and killed 80 infiltrators, claiming the insurgents are being trained and armed in Pakistan.  Pakistan denies these charges but says it does support the Muslims' crusade for ""self-determination.""  The Prime Minister of Pakistan has sought the support of other Islamic nations.  The two nations have exchanged fire on several occasions, but both say there is no cause for concern.",Moslem separatists exacerbate Kashmir situation; India and Pakistan tradecharges,"Moslem separatists in Jammu-Kashmir have turned to violence hoping to gainseparation from India.  Over 1,000 have died in the violence and repressionfrom government forces.  India and Pakistan hurl accusations and somebullets at each other but claim the situation is localized and not serious.","India and Pakistan have feuded over Jammu-Kashmir since the subcontinentwas divided in 1947.  It is India's only predominately Moslem state with 64%of its five million people Moslem.  Moslem separatists began a campaign ofviolence in Jammu-Kashmir hoping initially to lead to union with Pakistanbut later for independence.  Indian authorities began a crackdown in January1990, and by summer, over a thousand people died.  India accused Pakistan ofarming and training the insurgents, a charge Pakistan denied.  Despiteincidences of soldiers firing across cease-fire lines, the two countriessaid the situation was local and not serious.","Kashmir had been a separate kingdom ruled by a Hindu when Britainrelinquished colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent in 1947.   It waspartitioned on religious lines into India and Pakistan and Kashmir's Hinduking opted to be part of India.  The Jammu-Kashmir state is India's onlypredominately Moslem state with 64% of the state's 5 million people Moslem.Jammu-Kashmir has been a contentious issue between India and Pakistan fromthe beginning and the two have fought over it.  In 1990, separatistelements, most prominently the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, began acampaign of violence, including kidnapping, bombings, and assassinations.Initially, the Moslem separatists wanted to become part of Pakistan, butlater hoped to become an independent nation.  The Indian government began acrackdown in January of that year, imposing curfews and retaliating toinsurgent attacks.   By summer, police actions and separatists' violence hadresulted in over a thousand deaths.   India and Pakistan hurled charges ateach other with India claiming that Pakistan trained and armed theinsurgents, a claim that Pakistan denied.  Both nations sent troops to theborder area astride the cease-fire line and some shots were exchanged.Despite the tensions, both countries downplayed the incidents as beinglocalized and not serious.",,,,

Maxwell was found dead off the Canary Islands, apparently after having fallen overboard. Maxwell, along with his two sons, Kevin and Ian, and Michael Stone, a Maxwell executive, apparently were involved in the illegal transfer of funds.","Economic confusion surrounds the mysterious death of publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. Maxwell, who put together a publishing empire following his immigration to Britain in 1940, was found dead off the coast of the Canary Islands after apparently having fallen overboard from his yacht. There are allegations that Maxwell, along with two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, and a senior executive in several Maxwell corporations, Michael Stoney, were involved in the illegal transfer of funds to help his publishing empire fend off debt. The scheme used Swiss trusts and a number of institutions, including the U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs.","Robert Maxwell has been described as the Citizen Kane of his time. The mysterious death of this larger than life individual on November 5 has left the economic affairs of Maxwell Communications Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers is a state of confusion. Maxwell was born in Czechoslovakia and immigrated to Britain in 1940 to escape the Holocaust. He put together and personally ran world-wide publishing empire that included Macmillan Publishing House in New York, Britain's Daily mirror, the Daily Record and the European and British Printing Company, and communications Corp., Britain's largest printing company. Improprieties have been alleged in the handling of funds which involve not only Robert Maxwell, but two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, as well as Michael Stoney, an executive in several Maxwell companies. At issue is the alleged improper transfer of funds in an attempt to handle his publishing empire's crushing debts. Among the interests named in the transfer of funds to two Swiss trusts, is the U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs. Maxwell also is accused of using MCC in an effort to raise funds by making late payments on the foreign market. In doing so, MCC in effect gave itself an unauthorized loan.",British entrepreneur Robert Maxwell and sons guilty of financial fraud.,British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell died in 1991 in the waters off Canary Island while on vacation. His sons Kevin and Ian took over the Maxwell business but were soon found guilty along with their father of using illegal financial schemes and looting pension funds to pay off crushing debts.,"British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, owner of the Mirror Group Newspaper Ltd. of Britain and publisher of Britain's Daily Mirror and the New York Daily News, died in 1991 in the waters off Canary Island while on vacation.  His sons Kevin and Ian took over the business but were soon implicated along with their father in an illegal scheme to deal with crushing debts. Allegedly, unauthorized loans were acquired by using a Maxwell company to buy currency in one financial center while promising, but often failing, to make payments to another center. Some repayments were made by looting pension funds.","British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, publisher of Britain's Daily Mirror, bought the New York Daily News in 1990. He then planned to raise $448 million through the sale of shares in his Mirror Group Newspaper Ltd. of Britain. He bought Mirror Group in 1984 and turned it into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper groups.A year after the Daily News purchase, he was found dead in the waters off the Canary Island where he was vacationing on his yacht. Investigators say Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in an attempt to deal with crushing debts. Some $630 million was taken from his Mirror Group pension fund without authority. His sons Kevin and Ian, who took over the business, were investigated and found guilty for their knowledge of illegal schemes using two Swiss trusts, a private UK trust company and a US investment bank to support the Maxwell Communications Company (MCC). In a flurry of foreign exchange deals, the MCC would buy currency in one financial center promising, but often failing, to make payment in another center; thus getting an unauthorized loan. Some repayments were made by looting pension funds assets.",,,,

Senator Tower had been President Bush's nominee for Secretary of defense, but the nomination was rejected by the Senate on the recommendation of the Senate Armed Services Committee. This was only the ninth time in history that a cabinet nominee has been rejected. The committee recommended rejection after hearing allegations about Tower's use of alcohol and his inappropriate behavior towards women. The committee also questioned his dealings with defense contractors after Tower gave contradictory testimony.","Former Texas Senator John Tower was killed in a commuter plane crash on Sea Island, off the coast of Georgia. The crash, which killed everyone on board, also took the life of his daughter, Marian. Tower was recently the center of controversy when his nomination for Secretary of Defense was rejected by the Senate Armed Forces Committee and the full Senate. Tower became only the ninth nominee in history to be rejected. He also was the first nominee ever to be rejected so early in the term of a new presidency. Tower's rejection followed allegations of problems with alcohol. Tower admitted that he had been a heavy drinker in the 70s but that he has since limited his drinking to a glass of wine with dinner. Tower, twice divorced, also was accused of inappropriate behavior towards women. The Senate Armed Services Committee also called into question his contradictory testimony on his dealings with defense contractors. Tower told the committee that his advice to British Aerospace was limited to civil aviation matters while in a 1987 deposition written for his second divorce, he said he advised the company on selling certain systems to the defense department.","Ex-Senator John Tower, rejected for Defense Secretary, killed in plane crash","Former senator John Tower's bid to become Defense Secretary failed on a53-47 vote in the Senate.

Tower said earlier problems with alcohol were behind him, butthere were indications that they still existed. The Democratic controlledArmed Services Committee voted 11-9 against recommending Tower.

Tower conceded that years earlier he had problems with alcohol,but said those days were behind him.  Questions continued to surface thatthose days were not that long ago.  The FBI was lax in investigating thoserecent incidents.  An editorial supporting Tower conceded that he hadearlier ""boozed it up and fooled around"" but said that recent charges didnot have substance.  Tower's testimony that he had not dealt in defensematters when on the payroll of British Aerospace contradicted an earlierdeposition in which he said he did just that.

Senator Jesse Helms and other conservatives objectedto one nominee because he was a Democrat and were thought likely to havesuch strong objections to another that her name was withdrawn.

The death toll made this the fourth deadliest earthquake worldwide in fifty years. The quake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale and exacted particularly heavy casualties since it occurred when most people were inside asleep and hit a coastal area of loosely deposited soil that shifts, causing the adobe homes in the area to collapse. The Iranian President appealed for international aid from all countries except Israel and South Africa. Countries around the world, both friendly and hostile to Iran's Islamic government, responded quickly. The aid from the United States, including funds and supplies raised by Iranians in California , was channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This was a rare example of U.S.-Iranian cooperation after the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Countries as diverse as Egypt, China, India, Malaysia and the Soviet Union sent help. Even Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born author of ""Satanic Verses,"" condemned to death by the Iranian ayatollahs, contributed $8,600. All was not sweetness and light, however.

The coup unraveled swiftly as the junta was unable to cope with thousands of people who erected barricades around Yeltsin's stronghold, the Russian Parliament. The national legislature demanded Gorbachev's reinstatement and nullified the coup leaders' decrees. The Communist Party, seeking to salvage its image, denounced the takeover. The coup people thought they could take over by neutralizing Gorbachev.However, the real issue was not Gorbachev but the new political culture of freedom and democracy his reforms had created. Gorbachev initiated the changes but his standing was transformed when he was trumped by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin who, unlike Gorbachev, challenged the Communist Party and stayed close to the Russian people. Gorbachev and Yeltsin at first appeared as equals while launching a purge of the Communist Party, although Gorbachev balked at Yeltsin's proposals to ban the Communist Party.

Some viewers suspected a Gorbachev role in the coup asa ploy to solidify his position. The coup ended after three days due mainlyto opposition by Boris Yeltsin who rallied thousands in opposition.  Coupleaders were arrested and Gorbachev was returned to the presidency.Gorbachev still hoped to implement reforms working through the CommunistParty.  Yeltsin, however, had quit the party and wanted to see its influencelessened.  Yeltsin was clearly moving into a greater leadership role in thenew Russia.","Soviet hard-liners attempted a coup in order to thwart the impending signingof the new Union Treaty incorporating the reforms of Soviet PresidentGorbachev.  The coup leaders put Gorbachev under house arrest in the Crimea.Russian President Boris Yeltsin led opposition to the coup, which did nothave popular support, and it was put down after three days.  Gorbachev wasreturned to Moscow and was reinstated as president.  Some observers wonderedabout Gorbachev's actions just before the coup attempt since he had ignoredample warnings that it might happen. Conspiracy buffs even wondered ifGorbachev might have even been part of the planning.Upon his return to power, Gorbachev ordered the arrest of the coup leadersand made new appointments to key positions.  The putdown of the coup meantthat the reforms giving more authority to the republics would go forward.Gorbachev and Yeltsin approached the reforms differently.  Gorbachev wantedto work through the Communist Party, but Yeltsin had quit the party andwanted to see its influence lessened.  Yeltsin was clearly more in touchwith the people.

Gorbachev decried the unrest, but admitted that early Soviet efforts to fashion a unified culture out of a melange of more than 100 ethnic groups using 100 languages was a cause of the current troubles. In the two years preceding June 1990 the Kremlin had dispatched troops to quell fighting in 13 regions. There had been unrest in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, and serious fighting in Georgia, Azerbaijan and KazakhstanThe demise of the Soviet Union touched off new ethnic conflicts. Those already underway worsened. Armenia and Azerbaijan fought over an enclave of Armenians within Azerbaijan. A group in South Ossetia wanted out of Georgia. Minorities of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians fought for rights in Moldavia.In late 1992 Russia sent specially trained troops to halt fighting in the Caucasus Mountains and in Tajikistan.

deadly use of military force against its citizens by the government of China in Beijing's Tiananmen Square June 3-4, 1989 left thousands dead, resulted in great damage to China's repute abroad, exacerbated internal disputes, and was not a fatal blow to the pro-democracy movement in China.","The military assault on pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square onJune 3-4, 1989 cost at least 2,600 lives and perhaps as many as12,000. 2,000 students had encamped in the square and begun a hungerstrike in May and a million citizens rallied to their support. Whenthe declaration of martial law did not intimidate the students andtheir supporters, the government resorted to the use of massiveforce. The pro- democracy movement started after the death of formerCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989 with studentsshouting ""Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!""","On June 3, 1989 at 1 a.m. tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing marching toward Tiananmen Square to dislodge student pro-democracy demonstrators who had  encamped there for three weeks. Within 28 hours the students were dispersed at a cost in lives estimated by the Chinese government at 300-400, by officials of the Chinese Red Cross as 2,600, and by others as between 3,000 and 12,000. The crisis was not at an end, however, as soldiers continued random shooting of civilians and rival factions of the Chinese army started shooting at one another. During June 5-9 governments around the world condemned the brutal suppression advising theirnationals to leave Beijing. Chinese abroad mourned the dead. Anti-government demonstrations spread to Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities. The pro-democracy movement had its origin with the death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989. By April 17 thousands of students marched in Beijing and Shanghai shouting ""Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!"" The protest movement focused on Tiananmen Square when 2,000 students began a hunger strike there  and a million citizens rallied to their support. When declaration of martial law did not intimidate the protesters the government resorted to the massive use of troops and firepower.",Chinese Troops Crush Student Reformers. Thousand Killed In Tiananmen Square.,"Chinese troops fought through crowds of protesters on 3 June 1989, killing thousands as they crushed the reform-minded student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Surviving students fled the square, ending their defiant three-week occupation of the square. Later demonstrations in other Chinese cities protested the Beijing slaughter.","Firing indiscriminately on the crowds as they advanced, Chinese troops broke through barricades of reform-minded protesters late on 3 June1989 and reached Tiananmen Square after being rebuffed in earlier attempts. Early the next day they routed the surviving demonstrators who fled the square that had occupied for three weeks in defiance of government orders. Thousands died in the two days of violence. The bloody weekend was the climax of trouble that had escalated since April.Later demonstrations in other large Chinese cities protested the Beijing slaughter. The United States suspended all military sales to China.","Late on Saturday evening, 3 June 1989, Chinese troops broke through barricades on streets leading to Tiananmen Square. The soldiers fired indiscriminately on the crowds as they scattered resisters. The troops had previously been unsuccessful in reaching the square. By noon on 4 June the troops had crushed the demonstrators for political reform and forced them to flee the square they had occupied for three weeks in defiance of  government orders issued under martial law. The army soon removed evidence of the protest , including the student-built replica of the Statue of Liberty.The bloody weekend was the climax of trouble that had been escalating since April. It had grown tense, but largely peaceful during the three weeks prior to 3 June.The government insisted that only 300 were killed. The Chinese Red Cross said 3,600 died and 60,000 were injured. Most of those killed on 3 and 4 June fell in streets leading to Tiananmen.Demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other large Chinese cities on 5 June protested the slaughter in Beijing. The United States suspended all military sales to China. Many foreign embassies urged their citizens to leave Beijing.",,,,

The drought has forced some states to import hay from other states. Communities in many states have imposed tight water rationing.",A severe drought continues to affect large areas of the United States and climatologists warn that the future could see more unless steps are taken to halt the earth's rising temperature. The drought is the worst since records began being kept in 1895 and hasaffected grain production across the nation. Grain supplies are expected to fall to 17 percent of what is required to safeguard world food security. Communities in the areas affected have restricted water use and Oregon has begun to ship hay to Kentucky. Some areas have seen some relief as heavy storms hit large sections of the country.,"A severe drought has affected large portions of the United States as rainfall was below normal in major grain growing states. The drought, rated severe by July 2, is the worst noted since the U.S. began keeping records in 1895 and affects about 35 percent of the contiguous United States.  If conditions continue, the areas affect could exceed the 60 percent of 1934 and the 50 percent of 1954. The drought has caused grain and soybean futures to drop and grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of what is considered necessary to safeguard world food security. Many poorer nations could face food shortages as grain prices rise. Many communities from Iowa to Alabama face water shortages that leave officials seeking alternate water supplies. Other areas have imposed bans on outdoor water use. Heavy storms which have spread across the nation have brought deluges to Texas and Arkansas, tornados to Kansas, and damaging high winds to Michigan and Indiana but water restrictions will remain in effect for the immediate future. Kentucky received its first of hay from Oregon. Farmers in Kentucky, as in other states, were forced to seek hay elsewhere when the drought dried up pastures.","Prolonged 1988 drought affects crops, livestock, water, jobs; prompts aid","In mid-July, 1988's drought was predicted to continue three months.

The United Nations voted on 6 August to impose broad trade and military sanctions on Iraq.

Some major oil importers had already embargoed Iraqi oil. Oil prices soared.The United States moved an aircraft carrier into the Arabian Sea. Iraq warned its people of a possible United States attack. President Bush only said that all options were open.","Iraq's powerful army invaded Kuwait early on 2 August 1990. The small Kuwait army offered little resistance. Kuwaiti government buildings were occupied and 350 Iraqi tanks swept toward the southern oilfields. The invasion followed Hussein's claim that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area, and exceeded OPEC production quotas. Kuwait dismissed Iraq's claim that a Kuwaiti revolutionary group invited the invasion. Iraq had signaled the coming of the invasion by moving 100,000 troops to the border, and CIA warned that it might well occur.The United Nations Security Council immediately condemned the invasion, and on 6 August voted 13-0 to impose sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq. United States. Japan and the European community had already cut off the importation of Iraqi oil. Oil prices soared. Iraq felt an almost immediate effect, and closed one of the pipelines that carries export oil across Turkey. Iraq retaliated by rounding up westerners in Kuwait, and moving some to Baghdad.President Bush denounced the invasion. A United States aircraft battle group moved into the Arabian Sea.

It claimed to have responded to a request by a Kuwaiti revolutionary group.  A skeptical U.S. and U.N. rejected this justification, condemned the action, demanded withdrawal, and threatened sanctions.  The beleaguered Kuwaiti government requested U.S. military intervention.  Divided Arab nations failed to resolve the crisis. After further Iraqi intransigence, strong U.N. economic and military sanctions were imposed, including a ban on Iraqi oil and imports.  The price of oil soared.  Iraq responded by rounding up foreigners in Kuwait, sending some to Baghdad, and alerting its citizens to a possible U.S. attack.","Iraq ended its 1980-1988 war with Iran in debt for about $80 billion.  On July 17, 1990 Iraq provoked a major crisis by accusing Kuwait of costing it billions by exceeding Kuwait's OPEC assigned oil production quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, by stealing Iraqi oil from a disputed border oil field, and also by demanding repayment of a $15 billion war debt.  After Egyptian and Saudi Arabian mediation failed, Iraq invaded Kuwait with 100,000 troops led by 350 tanks.  It quickly overran Kuwaiti defenses and continued south to the oil fields.  Kuwait leaders, including the emir, escaped to Saudi Arabia.  They appealed for U.S. military intervention.  The Pentagon diverted an aircraft carrier group toward the gulf.  A U.S. led U.N. resolution demanded that Iraq immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Kuwait.  Iraq responded that it invaded at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had already overthrown the government of Kuwait and this was not a U.N. matter.  The U.N. rejected this justification as a farce and imposed strong economic and military sanctions after Iraq failed to withdraw.

The opposition People's Mojahedin blamed thegovernment for shoddy housing that caused the deaths, which they said wereunderreported.  The government, in turn, blamed the US for robbing it of oilresources and leaving too little for developing modern construction methods.Iran said it would accept aid from all countries, even the US, but not fromIsrael and South Africa.

The quake occurred when most people were inside asleep and hit a coastal floodplain where loosely deposited soil shifts easily and caused the fragile adobe homes in the area to collapse. The Iranian president appealed for international aid and the response was overwhelming, including assistance from the United States, the first such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. On the negative side, Iranian news media were slow to report on the disaster and the Iranian and U.S. government were blamed by their respective critics for the excessive casualties.","An earthquake hit Gilan and Zanjan provinces in northwestern Iran onJune 21, 1990 killing at least 50,000 people, injuring 200,000 andleaving 400,000 homeless.

Super Bowl XXV will be held in Tampa Stadium and will feature local entertainment designed to resolve area racial disputes. For Super Bowl XXVII, the Rose Bowl is being offered rent free to the NFL.","The San Francisco 49ers won the 1989 and 1990 Super Bowls, marking four out of four wins and setting several players' records. The 1990 Super Bowl was the lowest rated in 21 years, although the most watched TV event of the week.Super Bowl XXV, to be held in Tampa in 1991, will feature local events planned by a committee headed by two black men in order to resolve an area racial dispute. Only 80% of the face value of Super Bowl tickets can be deducted now. The Rose Bowl is being offered rent free to the NFL for Super Bowl XXVII.","The San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl in 1989 and 1990 marking the fourth win in four tries. Super Bowl records were set by the 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and wide receiver Jerry Rice. President Bush congratulated the 1989 victors at an East Room reception.Super Bowl XXIV (1990) was the most watched TV event of the week although it was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 21 years. Anheuser Busch Cos., Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., taking advantage of weeks of hype, staged mock football games in TV commercials using animated beer bottles.Super Bowl XXV will kickoff in Tampa Stadium in 1991. It will feature an extravaganza with marching bands, a street festival and floats. Two black men were named to head a community relations committee in order to resolve a local racial dispute. Several minority-owned business won lucrative contracts with the NFL.New tax lows place higher restrictions on what can be claimed as business-entertainment expense. For Super Bowl events, this means only 80% of the face value of tickets can be deducted. For Super Bowl XXVII in 1993, the Rose Bowl is being offered rent free to the NFL, along with all income from concessions and novelty sales.",Communities Offer Incentives for Super Bowl; 49ers Dominate Decade,"The Super Bowl is big. The viewing audience is large, and Beer companies spend millions on game-related ads. Communities offer rent-free stadium use to lure the game. Tighter tax laws haven't diminished corporate attendance. In Tampa 1991, the black community shared in the profits.San Francisco has four Vince Lombardi Trophies.","Super Bowl XXIV gave the 49ers their fourth Vince Lombardi Trophy. Sixty-three percent of TV viewers watched the lopsided game which also featured the conclusion of the ""Bud Bowl II,"" a $7 million Anheuser Bush ad campaign. Though the game can spotlight a community's problems, it also has tremendous economic impact. Communities such as Los Angeles--Orange County, therefore, offer incentives, such as rent-free stadium use, to lure the game to their city. Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

In Guatemala, a ferry captain was charges with negligent homicide when his boat which was being towed, sank after he failed to steer it.   A ferry sank off the Egyptian coast after inexplicably leaving standard navigational channels and ramming a coral reef in stormy seas.  In that accident, survivors claimed that crewmembers abandoned ship without helping them.  The ship's engineer denied the charges.  Two boats carrying Somali refugees sank off the coast of Kenya, resulting in more than 140 deaths, although the cause of the sinking was not reported. An overcrowded ferry in Bangladesh sank with almost double the passengers it was authorized.  In a separate ferry incident in Bangladesh, pirates robbed passengers and threw six overboard. In the Indian accident, monsoon rains may have contributed as well as overcrowding.  Even an advanced country such as Israel can experience ferry accidents.

Most companies, however, can cover the losses. Because South Carolina residents heeded evacuation warnings from the Hurricane Center, Hugo claimed only 17 lives in the state.","The two largest property insurance companies in the Carolinas, State Farm and Nationwide, estimate Hurricane Hugo losses at $600 million, making it the costliest hurricane ever.Hugo, a Category 4 storm dubbed a ""killer hurricane"" by Charleston's mayor, struck the city Thursday night. Though there was significant damage, only two were killed in Charleston, 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who heeded Hurricane Center warnings and evacuated before the storm's arrival.Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.","American Insurance Service Group says Hurricane Hugo, which ravaged the Caribbean and the Carolinas last week, is responsible for record hurricane losses. State Farm Insurance expects claims of approximately $500 million in the Carolinas. Nationwide Insurance is projecting claims near $100 million. Though the Hugo-related losses are substantial, most companies have sufficient funds to cover them. Some companies, however, will reduce third-quarter earnings.Hugo slammed into Charleston Thursday night with top winds of 135 mph. Upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane hours before it struck the historic city, it caused widespread damage throughout the Carolinas. Only two lives were lost in Charleston, however, and only 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who monitored the hurricane and evacuated.  Computer models at the National Hurricane Center used satellite information to track Hugo's path into Charleston. Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, the governor declared a state of emergency and National Guardsmen were ordered to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and shorefront. Thousands fled inland or went to shelters.Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.",Forecasters Saved Lives During Deadly Hurricane Hugo,"Hurricane Hugo which hit Charleston, S.C. head-on the night of Sept. 21, 1989 was the costliest storm in the city's 300-year history. Despite widespread devastation (insured losses approached $5 billion) there were only 17 deaths in South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself thanks to accurate forecasting in time for an effective evacuation.","On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, South Carolina head-on with winds at 135 mph causing extensive property damage, but claiming only 17 lives in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself. The relatively low casualties were a result of an accurate prediction of the point of windfall by hurricane forecasters, effective evacuation measures and good response from residents. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion, by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area, but insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims.","Hurricane Hugo approached the Carolina coast on Sept. 21, 1989 with its windspeed up to 125 mph and threatened to hit between Savannah, GA and Charleston, S.C. It hit Charleston head-on with winds of 135 mph and then proceeded northwestward hitting other population centers rather than heading up the coast or out to sea as expected. Fortunately Hurricane forecasters analyzing computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane made an accurate educated guess as to the point of landfall in time for threatened residents to evacuate. As a result, only 17 deaths resulted in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston which took the brunt of the storm. Charleston had been through many hard times in its 300- year history, but Hugo was by far the worst hurricane in its experience. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion but insurers were confident that they could handle all claims. Disaster aid came to Charleston from an unexpected source. Kingston, New York  raised funds to aid Charleston in thanks for 1,000 New York pounds sent by the South Carolina governor in 1778 to help the citizens of Kingston after it was burned by the British.",,,,

Telescope Finally Got Into Orbit,"After a delay of seven years caused by technical problems and the Challenger accident, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched on space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990 and four days later was orbiting on its own 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere. The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,

He will be remembered for surrendering in WW II. Though mourned by many, Asians often viewed him as a symbol of Japanese aggression. A BBC documentary claims Truman helped Hirohito avoid a war crimes trial.","Japan's Emperor Hirohito, posthumously named Showa, left a $13 milliontaxable estate.  He died of cancer on Jan. 7.Hirohito is remembered for surrendering in WW II. Though many worldleaders mourned his passing, South Korea and others viewed him as asymbol of Japanese crimes against Asian people.Generally portrayed as a peaceful man, a January BBC documentaryclaims that Truman decided not to prosecute Hirohito for war crimes,and that Japan's wartime prime minister was pressured into changinghis testimony to avoid incriminating the emperor.  An LA newspaperpublished a letter to the editor after Hirohito's death alsoquestioning his innocence.","Emperor Hirohito, who died on January 7 of cancer after several months of internal bleeding, left a taxable estate of approximately $13 million. Posthumously named Showa, or Enlightened Peace, the name of his reign, Hirohito will be remembered for his most courageous decision in his 62-year reign: Japan must surrender and end the Pacific conflict in WW II.Though many world leaders mourned his death, painful WW II memories sparked criticism of the monarch. South Korea sent condolences, but a government party statement added, ""We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past."" A Taiwanese newspaper noted that ""while Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe..."", he did not direct a single word to China..."" Generally portrayed as having had no significant role in the war, a BBC documentary by Edward Behr challenged this view, alleging that Hirohito had advance knowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack. The show also claims that President Truman decided not to prosecute Hirohito for war crimes, and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen.Tojo, was pressured into changing his testimony to avoid incriminating the emperor. A letter to the editor of an LA newspaper after Hirohito's death also expressed doubt that he was blameless.","Emperor Hirohito, controversial World War II  leader of Japan dies.","Emperor Hirohito of Japan died in 1989 at the age of 87 after a long illness.  He was emperor During World War II and while some regard him as a powerless figurehead, others believe he was complicit in Japan's war crimes.  He is succeeded by his son Akihito.","Emperor Hirohito of Japan died in 1989 at the age of 87.  He ascended the throne in 1926 and presided over one of Japan's most tumultuous eras.  The last of the World War II generation of leaders, Hirohito was a controversial figure, even in death.  While western leaders generally, Asian leaders whose countries suffered under the Japanese military in World War II were cool.  While some historians regard him as a powerless figurehead, others believe that he was complicit in Japanese war crimes.  Hirohito died of cancer after a long illness and is succeeded by his son Akihito.","Emperor Hirohito of Japan died in 1989 at the age of 87.

While many western leaders praised him, many Asian leaders, whose countries suffered under the Japanese military during World War II were cool.  While most historians believe that Hirohito was a powerless figurehead, others believe that he had to have known of the massacre of thousands of Chinese in Nanking and of the plan to bomb Pearl Harbor.  Some believe that the U.S. covered up his complicity in war crimes after the war to avoid unrest in Japan.  After the U.S. dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, Hirohito announced Japan's surrender in a radio address to his nation.  After the war, Hirohito was just a symbol but the imperial system has remained important to the Japanese people.  Hirohito had traveled in Europe and had a preference for Western food and clothes.  With few real responsibilities, he spent much time in the study of marine biology.  He died of cancer after a long illness and  is succeeded by his son Akihito.",,,,

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing groupof runners in those events.In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured manysuccessful Olympic athletes.",,,,

Satellites, computers, and reconnaissance planes helped forecasters monitor Hugo's progress. Insurance claims broke records. The greenhouse effect could raise future storms' destructive power by 50%.","Category 4 Hurricane Hugo did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean on Sep 17, 1989, and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo. Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.",Hurricane Hugo Could Have Been Deadlier. Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.",,,,

The Oct. 4-6 uprising never spread to other islands. Aquino has survived two major coup attempts and several military mutinies. The current rebellion is the latest of several military mutinies. In August Aquino reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to negotiate cease-fires with Communist guerillas and former soldiers who have staged coup attempts. In December 1989 a confrontation between pro-coup supporters and Aquino supporters occurred at the Philippine consulate in Los Angeles.Aquino's government has also had its political controversies. Her opposition to the nomination of Secretary-designate Abad raised doubts about her commitment to social reform. In 1989, her Vice President refused to condemn the insurrection that was then unfolding.Aquino rose to power in 1986 after dictator Ferdinand Marcos, accused of stealing billions of government funds, was ousted. June1988 news stories quoted sources saying Aquino would allow Marcos to return to the Philippines to stand trial, but a year later she stated the critically ill Marcos could not return to die, nor could he be buried in the Philippines.Aquino traveled to West German in 1989 seeking economic assistance.","Marcos, military, Communists, agrarian policy, and economy plague Philippine President Aquino.","Philippine President Corazon Aquino was beset with problems from 1988 to 1990.

The jury acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 counts and deadlocked on 13.  The case began in 1983 and became a frenetic witch-hunt led by the California media.  At one time, seven defendants, 135 charges, and over 400 children were involved.  Following the verdict, defendants wept, while parents decried the system for failing their children.  The judge was not surprised.  Jurors faulted the children's videotaped interviews, saying the interviewer asked leading questions.  Jurors believed some may have been molested, but the prosecution failed to prove the defendants responsible.  The therapist conducting the interviews defended her technique.  The current and former Los Angles district attorneys blamed each other and denied their ambitions influenced the case.  The pre-school's neighbors were disappointed and concerned about the building.Reverberations will continue.  Several books and television movies are planned, although the response of the networks is not known.  Two civil suits by former defendants are underway and Mrs. Buckey said she plans to sue.  Parents of the children may decide to file civil charges because the burden proof is lower.

Prosecutors must now decide if they want a retrial on the deadlocked charges. Originally involving 7 defendants, including Raymond Buckeys sister and grandmother, the charges against the sister and grandmother as well as three employees of the school were dropped. Parents of the children involved expressed anger and disappoint at the verdict.","The McMartin Pre-School child molestation case, the longest and costliest criminal trial in U.S. history ended with the acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 charges. A decision has yet to be reached on whether to retry Buckey on the 13 charges on which the jury deadlocked. The case originally involved Buckey and his mother, as well as his sister and grandmother and three other employees of the school. The charges against the sister, grandmother and the three employees were dropped for lack of evidence. In reaching their verdict, the jury said that the videotaped interviews of the child were a factor in finding the Buckeys innocent. The jurors felt the interviewers asked leading questions and never allowed the children to tell their own story. A number of the jurors stated that they believed some of the children had been molested but that the prosecution had not proven that Raymond Buckey was responsible. The verdict was greeted with anger by the parents of the children involved who felt the prosecution and the legal system had let them down.

It quickly overran the Kuwaiti capital and then continued on to southern oil facilities.  The United States led the United Nations in condemning this action and imposing tough economic and military sanctions.","Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions by exceeding OPEC production quotas thus driving down oil prices.  He further accused Kuwait of ""stealing"" Iraqi oil from a common oil field on their border.  He then invaded Kuwait, claiming to do so at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  The United States led the western world and the United Nations in calling the coup a sham, denouncing this invasion and imposing strong economic and military sanctions on Iraq in an attempt to get them to withdraw.  Oil prices surged while Saddam warned against foreign intervention.  The U.S. dispatched warships to the area.","It appeared that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his countries financial problems and territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  Iraq emerged from its 1980-1988 war with Iran with a debt of approximately $80 billion.  Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions in oil revenues by exceeding OPEC assigned oil quotas, thus driving down the price of oil.  He further accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from an oil field common to their border and also of conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq economically and militarily.  Breaking off perfunctory negotiations with Kuwait, Iraq invaded, claiming it responded to a request for help from Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  Iraq quickly overwhelmed a mismatched Kuwaiti military, captured the capital and continued south to the oil facilities.  The United States called the coup a farce.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador asked the United States to intervene militarily.  U.S. President George Bush called for an ""immediate and unconditional"" withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  Although not willing to publicly discuss military options, Bush said all U.S. options remained open.  His administration led a United Nations embargo of Iraqi exports, including oil, and Iraqi imports.  Iraq retaliated by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait.",Saddam Hussein Defied United States and United Nations,"On August 2, 1990, after Saddam Hussein had charged Kuwait with unfriendly acts, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic moves by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq remained defiant and moved troops toward the Saudi Arabian border. As of August 6, 1990 the situation was ominous.","In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border. The two countries agreed to talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives walked out. The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of them to Iraq. As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.","On July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPECproduction quotas and of stealing oil from wells along the countries'disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a""short-notice exercise"" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would notbe intimidated by U.S. pressure. Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwaitagreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq hadmassed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. The next day Iraq pulledout of the talks and on August 2,1990 invaded and quickly occupied allof Kuwait. President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blockedmost Iraqi imports. The U.N. Security Council denounced the invasionand demanded Iraq's withdrawal. The Pentagon stepped up air patrolsand movement of warships into the Persian Gulf. When, on August 6, theU.S.  pushed strong sanctions against Iraq through the U.N. SecurityCouncil, Iraq struck back, rounding up several hundred Britons,Americans, and West Germans in Kuwait, taking some of them toIraq. Iraqi troop concentrations menaced the Saudi Arabian border andthe U.S. warned Iraq of vital American interests in Saudi Arabia, butas of August 6, 1990 it was a stand-off. Iraq was in possession ofKuwait and oil prices soared on the international market.",,,,

Serving for over 11 years, longer than any prime minister in the 20th Century, the announcement of her resignation took the world by surprise. Mrs. Thatcher was the first woman prime minister in Great Britain and is credited with reviving the faltering British economy in the early '80s. Former President Reagan had nothing but praise for Mrs. Thatcher. While he was still in office, the two shared a special relationship, calling each other Margaret and Ronnie and often appearing together at international gatherings. The relationship with American cooled with the coming of the Bush administration but had improved in recent months. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev also had nothing but praise for Mrs. Thatcher and her attitude to the Soviet Union softened after her meeting with him. Her critics were not less vocal. Iraq rejoiced at her departure, while Argentina was guarded it its comments. Critics at home complained about her lack of sensitivity to women's issues. Queen Elizabeth II, awarded Mrs. Thatcher the Order of Merit on Friday while elevating her husband, Denis, to the hereditary title of baronet, dispelling rumors of animosity between the two women.",,,,,,,,

Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

Nearby Clark Air Base Emptied,"A series of volcanic eruptions in June 1991 rocked Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines. Gases, rock and ash shot from the mountain. Ascending clouds blanketed the area. The large U.S. facility Clark Air Base was evacuated. Farm villages were emptied. Experts issued warnings of a more massive eruption.","Mt. Pinatubo erupted on 9 June 1991 for the first time in 600 years. Further explosions continued for five days, with as many as six in a single day. Philippine and U.S. experts said that a more massive eruption could occur. The mountain shot out gases, rock and ash. Clouds ascending from Pinatubo rose to heights of ten miles, turning day into night and covering wide areas in ash. Personnel from the large U.S. facility at Clark Air Base were evacuated to the naval base at Subic Bay, most of them soon after the first eruption.","After slumbering for 600 years, the Mt. Pinatubo volcano erupted in June 1991. Mt. Pinatubo is on the Philippine Island of Luzon. It first erupted on 9 June, and the eruptions continued through the 14th, with as many as six eruptions on one day. The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, and the United States Geological Survey said the volcanic activity was increasing in a way that suggested a more massive eruption would occur. Heavy rain increased the danger of mudslides.The mountain shot out gases, rock and ash. Mushroom clouds ascended to heights of ten miles. The gray-green clouds turned day into night, and covered wide areas with ash. More than 19,000 panicked villagers within a 12-mile radius were evacuated.Clark Air Base, one of the largest U.S. overseas installations, is about ten miles from Pinatubo. Most airmen, dependents and civilian employees were evacuated to the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay on the 11th, following the first major eruption. The remaining personnel left a day or two later. Philippine President Aquino dismissed as a fabrication that she had been warned volcanic damage could cause a nuclear incident.","Pinatubo: Four Dead; 84,000 Evacuated.

About 84,000 have been evacuated.

The first eruptions shot gas, steam and ash 12,000 feet above the mountain. Today's eruptions spewed matter over 12 miles high, and a possible lava flow was seen for the first time. Clark, evacuated nearly a week ago, is covered in ash, as is Subic Bay naval base, which received the 16,000 Clark evacuees. U.S. officials, while not commenting on whether nuclear weapons are at the abandoned base, denied the possibility of radioactive contamination if molten rock hits the weapons depots. At least four deaths and 24 people injured have been recorded since Pinatubo began erupting after six centuries of dormancy. About 84,000 have been evacuated. Heavy rains today have raised fears of catastrophic mudflows.Pinatubo is in the ""Ring of Fire"" that circles the Pacific. Mount Unzen in Japan, also in the ring, recently erupted, killing 38.President Aquino toured refugee centers and authorized the release of $1.42 million for relief efforts.

Meanwhile vigorous lobbying of the entire Senate by pro- and anti-Thomas groups proceeded.","From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Thomas's refusal to answer certain questions caused complaints, but it appeared early on that the committee would approve the nomination. By the end of the questioning an affirmative vote of 10-4 or 9-5 was predicted. There was media attention to Thomas's wife Virginia. A successful Washington lawyer, she had taken strong conservative positions that antagonized certain groups and the fact that she was white and he black raised questions for some blacks. During the hearings lobbyists on either side worked to influence the ensuing vote of the full Senate.","From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, underwent five days of intensive questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Although it seemed likely that the committee would vote to confirm the nomination, some members complained that the candidate refused to answer certain questions and seemed to back away from statements that he had made in the past. By the end of the questioning it appeared that Thomas would be confirmed by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote. In the media Thomas's wife Virginia was presented as an issue. Virginia had an impressive career as a lawyer in Washington, often taking strong conservative positions. She is white while Clarence is black. Women's-rights activists objected to her opposition to comparable-worth legislation; some religious groups were wary of her anti-cult activities; and some blacks viewed the Thomases' marriage as indicating his rejection of the black community. Throughout the hearings the entire Senate came under pressure from groups supporting or opposing the nomination. Pro-Thomas groups included the Coalition for the Restoration of the Black Family and Society and the Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas. Opposing were the National Abortion Rights Action League and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.",Thomas' confirmation as second black justice in history of Supreme Court.,"Clarence Thomas completed five days of grueling days of testimony, apparently well on his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.  Thomas, a federal judge, was picked by President Bush to replace Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.","Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of testimony, apparently well on his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.

Thomas, a federal judge was picked by President Bush to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.

Several Democrats accused Thomas of being evasive and of disavowing many statements he made while an official of the Reagan and Bush administration.  Those who support the nomination include conservative groups such as The Restoration of the Black Family and Society and opposition came from women's and civil rights groups such as the national Abortion Right's Action League and the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.   Thomas and his wife Virginia, who is white, have opposed affirmative action programs.During the hearings Thomas refused to give his views on the 1973 abortion decision based on a woman's right to privacy.  On school prayer, he said ""any policy of exclusion should considered inappropriate.

in Texas.","Gilbert, the most intense hurricane ever recorded, ripped through the Caribbean, slammed into the Yucatan, then lost it's punch at the Texas-Mexico border.  It has caused massive flooding, took 109 lives, left about $8 billion damage in its wake and destroyed approximately 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes.","Gilbert, a killer Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds over 155mph and a record low barometric pressure of 26.13 inches, was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere.  At least 109 people died and damage is estimated at $8 billion.  It caused limited damage in the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba, but extensive death and damage in Jamaica where 100,000 of the country's 500,000 homes were destroyed.  It then inflicted severe damage to the Yucatan Peninsula resort areas of Cancun and Cozumel before weakening and moving on to the Texas-Mexico border.  In Texas it caused flooding and spawned dozens of tornadoes.","Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere.  This Category 5 storm, with sustained winds exceeding 155 mph and gusts clocked at 175 mph, had the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded at 26.13 inches.  Massive in size, it had storm winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of its eye.  For one hellish week in mid-September, 1988, it roared through the Caribbean, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula, and then moved back over water before finally losing its punch at its second landfall at the Texas-Mexican border.  In spite of officials' warnings and both voluntary and forced evacuations from coastal areas, it left a trail of death and destruction in its wake.  At least 109 people died; damage is estimated at $8 billion.  Hundreds of thousands are homeless.  Many survivors are still without food, drinking water and electricity.  The storm caused damage in Haiti, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, but the most severe damage was in Jamaica, where 100,000 of the country's 500,000 homes were destroyed, and then the Yucatan Peninsula where the resort areas of Cancun and Cozumel were hit hard.  The limited damage in Texas was caused primarily by flooding and by hurricane spawned tornadoes.",Hurricane Gilbert abates after ravaging the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan.,"Gilbert is now a tropical storm, bringing heavy rains, flooding, and mudslides to areas of northeastern Mexico.  Gilbert at one time was the most intense hurricane recorded and brought havoc to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.  Gilbert's center avoided Texas, although it spawned tornadoes along the coast.","Gilbert is now a tropical storm, bringing heavy rain, flooding, and mudslides to northeastern Mexico.  It did not hit Texas as feared, but did spawn tornadoes.  The Hurricane Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and during the last week ravaged the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands.  On Tuesday Gilbert had winds of 175mph and the lowest pressure ever recorded and was upgraded to a Category 5 storm, the highest.  Wednesday it slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula severely damaging the resort areas, severing electricity and communications, and causing widespread flooding.  At least 109 people have been killed and 800,000 left homeless.","Hurricane Gilbert has been downgraded to a tropical storm and is bringing heavy rain, flooding, and mudslides to northeastern Mexico.  Ten policemen were swept away in Monterrey and buses full of evacuees were lost in Matamoros.  Gilbert's feared path onto the Texas Gulf Coast did not materialize, although a number of tornadoes were spawned on Friday and Saturday.  In Mexico, relief operations are continuing in order to bring food, water, and medical supplies to survivors.Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and for the last week rampaged through the Caribbean, bringing destruction to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands.  Damages in Jamaica, where six were killed, are estimated at $8 billion.  On Tuesday Gilbert was upgraded to a Category 5 storm, the highest category and only the third recorded.  Winds were clocked at 175 mph and the lowest pressure ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere was measured at its center.  Wednesday Gilbert slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds, severely damaging the resort areas in Cancun and Cozumel, severing electricity and communications over a wide area, and causing widespread flooding.

Competitions attract numerous contestants and visitors.  In Israel, the dog of the year contest briefly outshone the general election and the uprising known as the intefadeh.Owners of one dog were embroiled in a law suit over whether the dog should be retired or not and a Manhattan artist's Weimaraners have served as both models for his work and appeared on Sesame Street.  Dog handling can be lucrative, but the overhead is high and the hours are long, according to Bill McFadden a professional dog handler.","Dog competition in national and international events is both entertainment and big business.  More than 2,500 dogs, representing 138 breeds competed for prizes at the All breed Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in 1989.  In 1988, 20,000 people attended Israel's dog of the year contest in Tel Aviv with 800 contestants representing over 50 breeds.  The event briefly outshone Israel's general election and the uprising known as the intefadeh.  The owners of one prize winning dog were embroiled in a law suit over whether the dog should be retired or not.  Stud fees were also at issue.Weimaraners served as both companions and models to a Manhattan artist.  One of the dogs has appeared on the television show Sesame Street and another was world famous when he died at the age of 11.  The Dog Fancier's Club organized an event in New York City to honor the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.   Bill McFadden, a professional dog handler for various owners has close to 100 champions a year.  He says he makes a good living, but the overhead is high and the hours are long.","Dog Shows - Bringing Out the Best of ""Man's Best Friend""","Dog shows throughout the world bring together hundreds if not thousands of contestants representing the world's 135 dog breeds.  Publicity stunts, professional handlers, sometimes the courts and possibly even violence may be involved.  Awards and glory await the champions.  Occasionally, some dogs manage to gain fame outside of the dog show scene.","From the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden, to Tel Aviv, Israel's violence threatened show, to the massive 2500 contestant show in Los Angeles, proud owners, or professional handlers such as Bill McFadden, let their pampered pouches strut their stuff for awards and glory.  For some dogs, shows aren't necessary to attain fame.  Police dog Nero, the NYPD's finest, was feted for apprehending more than 50 felons.  And photographer William Wegman's Weimaraners are, through his work, know to artists and children around the world.  And like other international championship events, sometimes lawyers and court are involved.","At dog shows throughout the world, proud owners compete their charges for the awards and glory that await the champions.  Prince, a fluffy, little Pomeranian, after winning at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden was honored at a lunch held at a Sardi's, a prominent New York City restaurant.  However, not all ""famous"" dogs are show dogs.  Sharing the limelight at Sardi's was Nero, New York City's top police dog.  Nero helped the police make hundreds of arrests and apprehend more than 50 felons.  And one need only look at the renown attained by photographer William Wegman's Weimaraners.  Artists worldwide know his dogs, as do children who watch ""Sesame Street"".  But it's the show dogs that crisscross the country to strut their stuff, sometimes as many as the 2,500 dogs representing 138 breeds that competed at the All Breed Dog Show and Obedience trials in Los Angeles.  Some may possibly go to Tel Aviv, Israel for its annual show.  Bill McFadden, a professional dog handler, works about 120 shows a year throughout the U.S., showing 20 to 25 dogs at each show.  Among those he shows is Kerrageen's Hotspur, the top award winning Kerry blue terrier of all time.",,,,

Millions watch the televised presentation of awards worth millions to film studios.","The Oscar nomination and selection process is under scrutiny as studios campaign to influence voting by Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences members. Directors  Brooks (1988),  Spielberg (1988), and Lee (1989) are among the luminaries who were overlooked in the annual voting during the award's 61-year history.Millions watch the televised awards show which can take over three hours. The 1989 show is memorable for the number of films honored and for a musical number that sparked a Disney suit against the Academy.The highly recognizable statue is not protected by copyright. Walt Disney was the most-awarded person (32).","Director Spike Lee, speaking at Syracuse University Monday, shrugged off the treatment of his movie by Academy Award voters. Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories. The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers. In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.  Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting. On average a best picture award is worth about $20 million, but there is no guarantee that Academy members actually complete their own ballots.Millions watch the awards presentation. The last awards show took a long three plus hours. The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character. Though long, the 1989 ceremony will be favorably remembered for the spread of the awards. Ten movies split 17 awards. The Oscar, created in 1928, is one of the most recognizable symbols in the entertainment world and is not protected by copyright. Katherine Hepburn and Walter Brennan are the actress and actor, respectively, with the most awards.","High-stakes Oscar is prized, promoted, presented with pomp, and protected","Oscars increase film earnings, prompting studios to woo votes. The Thalberg award recognizes overlooked giants like Steven Spielberg. Oscar shows have been criticized for their excesses. Disney sued over an unauthorized Snow White routine, and the academy  sued when other awards resembled the Oscar too much. The gold-plated Oscar is manufactured by R.S. Owens Co.","Oscar nominations and victories increase film earnings, and studios woo academy  members' votes. The Irving Thalberg award is useful for acknowledging overlooked giants. Steven Spielberg received it in 1987. Spike Lee blamed the few ""Do the Right Thing"" nominations on generational politics and racism. Oscar shows have been criticized for their excesses. Disney sued when the 1989 program opened with an unauthorized Snow White routine. The academy sued when other awards resembled the Oscar too closely, but a federal judge ruled the statuette was not copyrighted. The academy has tried to block Oscar sales. The gold-plated, 8-pound, 13-inch Oscar is manufactured by Chicago's R.S. Owens Co.","Oscar nominations and victories increase film earnings, and studios woo the 4600 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to get their votes. The annual awards ceremony has generated a wealth of Oscar award trivia. The Irving Thalberg award for consistently high quality has become useful for acknowledging overlooked giants and salving the academy's conscience. Steven Spielberg, never nominated for an individual achievement even though his films are record moneymakers, received it in 1987. 32-year-old Spike Lee blamed the paucity of nominations for his critically acclaimed ""Do the Right Thing"" on generational politics and racism. Oscar shows have been criticized for their excesses of commercialism, production numbers, and meaningless awards.  In 1989, Disney sued the academy for opening the program with a Snow White routine. The academy closely protects the Oscar's name and image. It sued when a film festival award and an employee-incentive trophy were too similar, but a federal judge ruled that the statuette had no copyright protection. The academy has also tried to block the sale of statuettes. The Oscar, manufactured by Chicago's R.S. Owens Co., weighs 8 pounds and stands 13 inches tall. It is made of Britannia metal and plated with copper, nickel, and gold.",,,,

Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican escaped with only some coastal flooding and a few deaths before Gilbert continued on to strike Jamaica with 110mph winds and torrential rains.  The storm, now one of the largest systems seen in the Caribbean for a long time, slowly traversed the length of the island causing massive damage and nineteen deaths.  100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes were destroyed leaving 500,000 people homeless.

The opening daycrowds were large and  enthusiastic about the flavor of the Big Mac. The openings cameafter years of negotiations which, in some cases, stipulated that McDonald's buy itssupplies locally.","The Big Mac debuted to mixed review as McDonald's opened restaurants in Korea,Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Large crowds stood in line for hours atopenings in Belgrade, Moscow, and Peking. Customers in Yugoslavia, the firstcommunist country to get a McDonald's, and China raved about the taste of the Big Mac.In Moscow, the Russians were less enthusiastic about its taste but gave a thumbs up tothe shakes. The openings came after long negotiations which, in most cases, sawMcDonald's contracting with local farmers for the beef, potatoes and other suppliesneeded for its restaurants.","McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets. After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.  To participate in Asia's fastest expanding economy, came their first restaurant in South Korea.  Moving into communist countries, its opening in Belgrade, Yugoslavia was followed by a record shattering opening of its largest outlet anywhere in Moscow.  Then came Shenzhan, McDonald's first foray into China.","To capitalize on Asia's fastest-growing economy McDonald's opened its first outlet in South Korea.  Moving into communist countries, on March 24, 1988 it opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  There to compete with the locally favored ""pljeskavica"", a pork and onion sandwich, initial reaction was favorable.  Two years later came its largest outlet to date.  In Moscow thousands lined up for an opening day record of 30,000 meals being served at 27 cash registers.  Next, McDonald's opened in China, where cooking is a culinary art.  McDonald's worldwide restaurants are joint ventures with locals of the country in which they operate.","""Golden Arches"" continues its worldwide expansion.  In 1988, seven years after its first attempt to bring a restaurant to South Korea, McDonald's successfully joint-ventured with Ahn Hyo Young, a Harvard schooled entrepreneur. McAhn Enterprises Ltd. had to fight government red tape and develop local suppliers in order to open in Seoul.  That year, Big Mac also braved the communist world.  On March 24, 1988, McDonald's successfully opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  Its local competition was the hamburger-like pljeskavica, i.e., ground pork and onion served on bread and eaten by hand.  Two years later, McDonald's had their most successful opening ever, worldwide.  In Pushkin Square, Moscow, thousands of people waited in line for hours at the largest McDonald's in the world for hamburgers, fries and shakes.  This opening day ""Mac attack"" resulted in 30,000 meals being served over fourteen hours at 27 cash registers.  Customers were surprised and pleased to find efficient, friendly workers in this country of generally surly service.  And then, China, where cooking is a culinary art.  A restaurant opened in Shenzhen, a special economic zone outside of Hong Kong where the average worker's pay there is considerably higher than in the rest of China.  McDonald's hopes to soon expand into Mainland China.",,,,

concerned world watches a divided Germany unite.,"With growing numbers of disgruntled East Germans emigrating to West Germany, the idea of reunification seemed possible and became actively discussed among western leaders.  Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.  All European and Jewish issues were addressed.  Reunification occurred.",East's Economy Sagging. Soviets Endorse German Reunification. World Awaits Change,"Woeful economic conditions and massive demonstrations in East Germany gave impetusto German reunification. Soviet endorsement of reunification in 1990 made it imminent.Many perceived a strong unified Germany as a danger, but that was accepted as a lesserthreat than East Germany in turmoil.","East Germany was near chaos by the end of 1989. Woeful economic conditionsprevailed. Massive demonstrations for democratic reform swept the nation. The hard-lineCommunist government admitted its failure, giving strong impetus to the Germanreunification movement. The Soviets endorsed it in February as the World War II Alliesdid later. Unification was now imminent.The specter of an economically and politically powerful Germany disturbed many, butparticularly the Poles, Soviets and world Jewry. Despite concerns, reunification would beaccepted as a lesser threat than a chaotic East Germany.","Through the first three months of 1989, 80,00 East Germans fled their country, andmassive demonstrations raised doubts that Erich Honeker the, hard-line Communistleader could resist the democratic reforms sweeping his country. Street demonstrationsoccurred throughout East Germany in November 1989, and the East German CommunistParty was forced to admit the its system had failed.The West German constitution called for a united Germany, but it received little attentionuntil late 1989. The specter of a powerful undivided Germany troubled many, butparticularly the Soviets and Poles.Matters moved quickly in early 1990. Soviet President Gorbachev gave West Germanyan unequivocal promise that German reunification would be honored. Two days later, onthe 12th of February, said that negotiations with East Germany should begin as soon aspossible after the 18 March East German elections. In time the World War II Allieswould endorse reunification.With reunification imminent, world Jewish leaders asked for guarantees that theHolocaust would not be repeated. Most prominent American historians agreed that astable Germany was a lesser threat to stability than the woeful conditions and near chaosin East Germany.",,,,

The Governor called a special session of the legislature to deal with the disaster and despite heavy losses, the insurance industry appeared optimistic. In Washington the White House launched into furious activity to answer critics of its performance in earlier crises.","The California earthquake of Oct. 17, 1989 caused extensive damage. Despite heavy insurance losses, insurance company stocks posted gains as investors bet on increases in insurance rates producing a long-term increase in profits. In Washington, the White House appeared hyperactive, anxious to show its responsiveness to the disaster. In Sacramento, Governor Deukmejian called a special session of the legislature to deal with the crisis. Critics accused him of blaming others for the collapse of freeways and called on him to get on with reconstruction and a temporary increase of the gasoline tax so hundreds of thousands of commuters could get to work.","The northern California earthquake of October 17, 1989 caused extensive damage to buildings and roadways. An official of the California Seismic Safety Commission said that assessing the disaster was ""like the blind man trying to feel an elephant."" Another on-site observer commented that the quake ""was like somebody slugging a punching bag. Usually earthquakes pass, but this one went on and on...It was very very bad."" Estimates of the loss to insurers ranged from $2 billion to $4 billion. Ironically, despite the record losses to insurers, insurance company stocks posted strong gains as investors bet that market forces and action by state regulators would result in higher insurance rates and long-term profits. In Washington the Bush White House flew into a whirlwind of activity to show the administration's ability for rapid response. In Sacramento Governor Deukmejian called a special session of the California legislature to deal with the disaster, but was perceived as blaming others for the collapse of freeways. Critics called on him to stop pointing fingers and get on with reconstruction.

The White House and the Federal Emergency Management Agency were accused of slow response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill and Hurricane Hugo. The Governor of California is assuring victims that the state will provide aid.  Analysts and industry spokesmen say only about 25-30% of homes in the San Francisco area have earthquake insurance.Insurers may have to pay billions of dollars for the earthquake.  The damage goes far beyond that of Hurricane Hugo last month.  Insurers are rushing into the area to process claims but no company is expected to suffer serious financial damage. Investors hope the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake will stem price-cutting wars between insurers the past two years. It is predicted that the quake damages may in fact lead to rate hikes. Insurers and state legislators are battling over rates and how they are set. Insurers as a whole are likely to increase the amount of reinsurance they buy, which will translate into an overall price rise.",,,,

There is also a ""scholarly study"" on his business.","Sam Walton died in April 1992, shortly after his 74th birthday on 29 March. He rose from humble beginnings to become the country's richest man.  He accomplished this by dint of hard work, an engaging personality and willingness to defy accepted retailing practices.After earning a college degree and serving in the army, he opened a Ben Franklin franchise in Arkansas. In 1962 his brother joined him and they opened the first Wal-Mart. When Wal-Mart was incorporated in 1971 there were 38 outlets. Wal-Mart's revenues then were only nine percent of Sears' and 11 percent of K-Mart's. Wal-Mart experienced phenomenal growth. In 1991, the year before Walton's death, Wal-Mart's revenues were greater than those of any other discount retailer. Walton eschewed the publicity that accompanied the annual Forbes' listing of the richest people. He spent most of his time at home in Arkansas, and whenever possible he visited his stores to exchange ideas with his salespeople, or as he called them ""his associates"".He was criticized for putting his stores in small towns, and causing the failure of many small businesses. He was also criticized for his anti-union policies.",,,,

About $8 billion is covered by insurance.  Most costs will fall on American companies, with British loses limited.  Andrew tore through southern Florida, flattening Homestead and leaving 25,000 homeless.  Industries and farms were damaged in Louisiana.  The dollar sustained a similar assault.","Damage from Hurricane Andrew is estimated at $20 billion, with $8 billion covered by insurance.  American insurers will take the brunt of the claims, but General Accident, the leading British insurer, expects claims to rise as high as $40 million.  Andrew tore through southern Florida, leaving 15 dead, power outages, and polluted water in his wake.  Homestead and the nearby air force base were flattened.  In Dade County, 250,000 people are homeless.  Andrew next smashed into Louisiana, killing two.  It missed the important oil refineries, but damaged crops and the oyster and alligator businesses.  The dollar sustained a similar assault.","Damage from Hurricane Andrew is estimated at $20 billion, with only $8 billion covered by insurance.  The last serious hurricane caused $4.2 billion in insured loses in 1989.  American insurers most affected by claims from Andrew are the State Farm Group, Allstate, Hartford Insurance, Aetna, and Travellers.  General Accident, the leading British insurer, expects their claims to rise as high as $40 million, which means the company may be able to pass losses on to external reinsurers.  Andrew hit the Bahamas, killing two, then on August 24 tore through southern Florida, where 15 were killed and power outages and polluted water plagued the residents for several days.  The city of Homestead and the nearby air force base were flattened.  In Dade County, 250,000 people are without homes.  After gathering strength over the Gulf of Mexico, Andrew next smashed into Louisiana, killing two and injuring dozens.  It did miss the important oil refineries, but damaged crops and the oyster and alligator businesses.  Andrew was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland.While Andrew ravaged the land, the dollar sustained a similar assault.  Bond yields rose as the Dow Jones and the dollar fell.  Insurance stock also fell, but home construction stock had big gains.","Hurricane Andrew, August 1992, Was Costliest to Date","Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas, southern Florida and Louisiana in August 1992 killing 19 and causing extensive property damage, particularly in Florida. The cost to insurers was estimated as high as $20 billion. After a slow start federal assistance was dispatched to Florida and Louisiana. The cost of the Florida operation alone was estimated at $20-$30 billion.","In August 1992 Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas, southern Florida, and Louisiana leaving 19 dead and extensive property damage. In Florida a quarter of a million were left homeless. The cost to insurers, concentrated in U.S. companies, was estimated as high as $20 billion and much of the damaged property was not insured. Federal authorities promised emergency aid after Florida officials complained of delays in supplying food and water. The cost of rebuilding Florida and caring for those displaced by the storm was estimated at $20-$30 billion. Fortunately the storm did not hit low-lying New Orleans or oil facilities along the gulf coast.","Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas, southern Florida and Louisiana in August 1992 with winds ranging up to 165 miles per hour, killing 2 in the Bahamas, 15 in Florida, and 2 in Louisiana. The greatest property damage was in Florida where a quarter of a million people were left homeless and 2 million were without power. Property damage there exceeded $15 billion, most of it uninsured. An early estimate set the total cost of the storm to insurers at more than $8 billion, but others forecast a total as high as $20 billion, mainly to U.S. insurers. After local officials in Florida criticized delays in delivery of emergency supplies, the White House promised ""dramatic"" improvement within 24 hours and President Bush ordered troops to Florida. The U.S. government estimated it would cost $20 billion to $30 billion to rebuild Florida and care for those displaced by the storm. Fortunately Andrew did not hit low-lying New Orleans or off--shore oil facilities along the Gulf coast. After the hurricane had passed an article in the  ""Financial Times"" compared Andrew to a crisis in the value of the U.S. dollar which was ""blowing itself out"" during the course of the hurricane. The comparison was inept.",,,,

Quayle briefly worked for state officials after college, and met and married his wife Marilyn in law school. They practiced law together before Quayle's 12 years in Congress.","Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, George Bush's surprise choice for vice-president in 1988, was criticized as a novice. His National Guard service and campaign gaffes were attacked. He proved a low-profile team player and Bush announced he would be on the 1992 ticket. Quayle's grandfather owned the newspaper in Quayle's hometown of Huntington. Quayle, known always as a nice guy, graduated from DePauw in 1969, took National Guard training, then in 1971 worked in the Indiana Attorney General's office and for the governor. At Indiana University Law School he met and married his wife Marilyn. They practiced law together before Quayle spent 12 years in Congress. They have three children.","Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, was the surprise choice of Republican George Bush for  presidential running mate in 1988. Quayle was compared to John F. Kennedy because of their similar ages and congressional service, and to Robert Redford in appearance. Quayle was criticized as a novice and his National Guard service attacked. His campaign gaffes made news, but he was loyal to Bush and a team player. After controversies subsided he kept a low profile. A year after the election he agreed to be on ""Meet the Press"", shortly after Bush announced he would be on the ticket in 1992, and was uncontroversial. Quayle grew up in Huntington, Indiana, population 17,000, where his grandfather owned the newspaper. He graduated from DePauw University in 1969, spent six months in National Guard training, then in 1971 investigated consumer problems in the Indiana Attorney General's office and became an aide to the governor. While attending Indiana University Law School he met and married his wife Marilyn. They jointly practiced law in Huntington before Quayle spent 12 years in the US Congress. Quayle has three children and is known as a nice guy with good values. In 1991, Huntington hosted an exhibit in his honor, which he didn't attend because of a busy schedule.","Bush, friends support Quayle despite errors and political inexperience",George Bush's selection of Dan Quayle as his running mate surprised many.Many political observers thought him a lightweight with baggage to carry.Bush continued to voice support for him even though Quayle was given only avery small role in the campaign and was not highly visible as vicepresident.,"George Bush's choice of Dan Quayle as his running mate surprised mostpolitical observers, but was quickly supported by many of Quayle's fellowRepublican senators. Quayle was viewed as a lightweight and questions wereraised about his military service and errors in his official resume. Hismain attributes were party loyalty and identification as a devoted familyman.  Quayle contributed little to the campaign and, after being elected,all but disappeared from the political scene.  President Bush, however,continued to voice support for, and confidence in Quayle.  His friends,especially in his home town, called him a winner.","George Bush's choice of Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate,surprised most political observers.  Despite service in Congress andSenate, he was looked upon as lacking the experience and mettle for avigorous national campaign.  Several Republican senators rallied support.Senator John Warner of Virginia compared Quayle to Thomas Jefferson.Senator Bob Dole in nominating Quayle at the Republican Convention, calledhim a dedicated public servant and devoted family man and cited his supportfor the Reagan program.Devotion to family and friends was a theme voiced by those who had knownQuayle for many years. Relatives and friends believed that if Quayle wereelected, he and his family would remain a strong unit.Questions arose regarding Quayle's fitness for the job, and there were somesuggestions that he should withdraw.  He had called himself a ""Vietnam-eraveteran"" which angered some actual combat veterans.  Quayle's service was in the National Guard, a position he apparently gained through familyinfluence.  Quayle's resume contained a reference to a position held inIndiana, two years before it was created.Quayle survived these criticisms but did not play a strong role in thecampaign or as vice president.  Friends, especially those in his hometown,remained loyal.",,,,

Top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies took part in the festivities.","On June 22, 1990 Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was hoisted by crane onto a flatbed truck. The removal of this symbol of the Cold War was part of an elaborate ceremony attended by the top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies. Appropriate to the occasion, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze backed away from all-out opposition to united Germany's membership in NATO, suggesting that this could take place but only after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave thecountry.","On June 22, 1990 Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was hoisted by a huge crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum. The guardhouse, constructed after erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was the scene of many successful and unsuccessful attempts at escape from East Berlin and had become a symbol of the Cold War. By June of 1990 with the Berlin Wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, and with top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city after unification, U.S. officials decided it was time to remove the famous landmark. The foreign ministers attended an elaborate ceremony to honor the symbolic act. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze took the occasion to modify the previous Soviet firm opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, proposing that such a step be allowed after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. U.S. Secretary of State Baker declared himself ""underwhelmed"" by the offer, but softening of the Soviet position was a welcome sign appropriate to the occasion.",The Cold War ends as Checkpoint Charlie is lifted into history.,"As a U.S. army band played and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, Checkpoint Charlie, the symbol of the Cold War, was lifted into history today. Its removal came after East Germany overthrew its communist government and opened the border between the two Germanys.","Checkpoint Charlie was lifted into history today during a ceremony including the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies. Secretary of State Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie as a symbol of the Cold War, hoped its removal would bury the conflicts it created. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for a removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city. Checkpoint Charlie became superfluous when the East Germany overthrew its communist-controlled government and the border between East and West Germany was opened. Although the ceremony was closed to the public, residents of the street watched from their windows.","Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous symbol of the Cold War was lifted into history today. At an invitation only ceremony attended by the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies, a U.S. army band played an old Berlin song as the checkpoint was hoisted onto a waiting flatbed truck, to be taken to a museum. Speaking at the ceremony, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for the removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city and the withdrawal of troops six months after the two German states unify. Secretary of State James Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol, expressed the hope that its removal would bury the conflicts it created. The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous. Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany. Among the invited guests was West Germany's Chancellor Willy Brandt who was mayor of Berlin in the 1960s.",,,,
