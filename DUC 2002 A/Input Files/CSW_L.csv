0,d116i,"Five astronaut boarded Discovery today second try sending Hubble Space Telescope orbit scan outermost reach universe clue beginning time. Astronomers starting tingle anticipation Hubble able accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head NASA science activity. Air Force forecaster said 90 percent chance weather would favorable launching shuttle scheduled time 8:31 am. EDT. More half million gallon liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen pumped space ship's fuel tank midnight. The astronaut, wearing bright orange flight suit, climbed crew cabin dawn breaking Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, give astronomer new set eye ear have, said William Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program. It's going change perspective altogether. I can't say we're going learn, I'll astounded learn many new thing. Discovery aiming altitude 380 mile, highest shuttle ever gone, telescope placed proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. It 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, journey space next month Astro observatory, sat launch pad 1.6 mile Discovery, second time pad occupied; first 1986 Challenger explosion. Hubble waiting take place space 1983, delayed technical problem Challenger accident. The latest postponement occurred April 10, Discovery's launch scrubbed four minute liftoff faulty power unit shuttle. The mood Kennedy Space Center considerably le festive first launch attempt, hundred astronomer gathered family. The day launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley use shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescope space. Veteran spacewalker Bruce McCandless II Kathryn Sullivan assist problem develops. Discovery follow Hubble 40 mile away two day lens cap opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Hubble expected start providing scientific data satellite month liftoff. However, NASA said release first image open star cluster constellation Carina week launch. In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million spent spare part, astronaut training computer software operate instrument. The European Space Agency contributed $250 million 15 percent viewing time. NASA estimate cost $200 million year operate maintain telescope space. During 15-year working lifetime, telescope provide astronomer 10 time better resolution 25 time sensitivity ground-based observatory. As result, able study star galaxy distant light traveling Earth 14 billion year. Astronomers hope learn whether universe created 15 billion year ago believed uncover mystery surrounding galaxy, black hole quasar. Hubble also expected shed light universe might end. The telescope named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, discovered 1920s universe expanding. His work gave rise Big Bang theory universe created tremendous explosion. In addition Hubble, Discovery carry human skull filled sensor measure space radiation astronaut receive. It skull's third trip space. The shuttle end five-day mission landing Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronaut returned Sunday second attempt launch shuttle NASA's valuable celebrated payload, $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery scheduled lift 8:31 am. EDT Tuesday. We feel confident thing going go well time, said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're going come OK Tuesday morning and, not, we'll keep trying do. That's kind name game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday countdown proceeding smoothly shuttle appeared perfect condition. The countdown got way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit forced first launch attempt scrubbed four minute liftoff April 10. The unit replaced new one, test showed fine. Hopefully, we'll get shuttle pad time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance favorable weather expected launch time, low cloud main concern, said Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front north expected pas area Monday night. The outlook considerably better Wednesday Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronaut arrived Johnson Space Center Houston early Sunday afternoon, shuttle Columbia transported launch pad 1.6 mile Discovery. It second time shuttle launch pad Kennedy Space Center occupied simultaneously. The first time January 1986; 16 day Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand said believe National Aeronautics Space Administration moving fast shuttle. NASA expects launch Columbia astronomical observatory called Astro earlier May 16, one week later planned Discovery's two-week delay. In case, could problem shuttle launch pad, Brand said. In particular case, everything's fitting together. NASA Saturday get Discovery ground. After that, launch attempt must halted eight day Hubble's battery recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen battery power Hubble time disconnected Discovery's electrical system two energy-collecting solar panel take space. Discovery's payload bay sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing risk contamination telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery aim altitude 380 mile, highest shuttle ever gone, telescope placed proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey space, astronomer expect look back nearly beginning time solve universe's perplexing mystery. Astro measure ultraviolet radiation undetected Hubble thus provide additional target telescope. The $100 million observatory also focus Columbia's nine-day mission Comet Austin, believed first trip solar system. Both Hubble Astro scheduled launch 1986, delayed Challenger accident. The Hubble Space Telescope awakened self-induced sleep today still use high-speed antenna, science instrument hold, unable begin observation. We `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, supervisor engineer controlling telescope. He said telescope running normal control-all mode, computer sensor guide pointing. Discovery's astronaut, meanwhile, packed gear return Earth Sunday, made last-minute observation Earth talked ground-based reporter flight. Pilot Charles Bolden said especially upbeat widespread public awareness telescope, expected eventually look back 14 billion light year nearly birth universe. It's hard go somewhere find someone never heard Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It make little kids' eye light up. It make little kid want learn add subtract study science. The telescope's big eye remained open, Hubble safe mode motion stopped earlier problem linking high-speed dish antenna relay satellite. The antenna primary link relaying scientific data ground. Terry said safe mode, one tape recorder telescope read telemetry signal system would played Earth analyzed antenna working properly. We expect use data investigate happened, said. Engineers able send command telescope secondary antenna communication system useful scientific data, must transmitted high rate speed. We're putting scientific instrument hold mode, effect standby mode, said. Shortly 6 am. EDT, controller Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md., completed series command took telescope safe mode began run 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health. It take another day $1.5 billion telescope operating way supposed point startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're backing deliberate slow careful approach problem, Olivier said Friday. This time anything dumb. The telescope problem put flight center several day behind, five astronaut deployed earlier week sticking schedule. Landing scheduled 9:48 am. EDT Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., flight controller keeping close watch weather. Winds predicted 20 mph gust 29 mph. Mission rule dictate headwind cannot exceed 29 mph touchdown. The shuttle carry enough supply stay orbit three day Sunday necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awakened crew member 1:30 am. EDT today playing song, Cosmos. Thanks wake-up music, pretty appropriate today, said Commander Loren Shriver. The song selected honor Hubble Space Telescope, open business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronaut finish experiment photography today pack trip home. They also planned hold news conference space reporter Johnson Space Center. Shriver pilot Charles Bolden run series test make certain shuttle's computer control jet ready return Earth. The crew deployed Hubble Wednesday stayed close telescope case trouble opening aperture door. Mission specialist Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan prepared perform space walk today crank open orbit 380 mile Earth. But proved unnecessary door opened Friday morning, exposing telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye starlight first time. Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscope stopped working door opened, engineer later got back line. The gyroscope knocked motion that, too, kept telescope safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director orbital verification Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's system set conservative limit first operation caused many malfunction. There also two communication outage totaling several hour. Hubble designed safe mode master destiny case contact orbiting communication system lost extended period, Terry said. NASA planned release first test image telescope Tuesday, showing open star cluster constellation Carina. But Terry said would delayed antenna problem. Scientific data follow month two. The telescope, named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, enable astronomer 15-year working lifetime look back 14 billion year possibly determine age universe. The universe believed created 15 billion year ago cosmic explosion. Hubble provided basis big-bang theory creation. He discovered 1920s universe expanding farther galaxy Earth, faster moving away. After year delay last-minute snag, Hubble Space Telescope freed shuttle Discovery Wednesday and, glinting sunlight, drifted orbit 15-year search new world. Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble end shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm delay getting one telescope's solar wing unfurled. The first NASA's great observatory station 330 nautical mile Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really looked great flew away it, sure hope good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later. The $1.5 billion telescope released 3:38 pm. EDT shuttle entered 20th orbit Earth, nearly two hour one orbit later planned. The shuttle backed away. Thank much ride, said Mike Harrington, director orbital verification Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialist Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan shuttle's airlock, ready walk inspace free solar panel. That proved unnecessary. Close cigar, better Hubble went way did, Sullivan said. She McCandless trained nearly five year make rescue mission. The first solar array unreeled mast midday Wednesday shuttle passed 380 statute mile, 330 nautical mile, South America's eastern coast. It started providing power telescope's battery, otherwise eight hour charge. Deployment starboard panel, however, troublesome. It budge latch first released, moved fifth 39-foot length, stopped again. A third attempt rolled panel way. Houston, see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley began long process releasing Hubble shortly 7 am. EDT grasped Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm carefully hoisted 12{-ton telescope high shuttle. Hubble taken shuttle electrical power lifted cargo bay operating nickel-hydrogen battery. At one day, seven minute flight Discovery, Hubble internal power, Carr said. The game begun. The race on. The clock ticking. Worries telescope's instrument would starved electricity eased first solar panel stretched out. Television camera Discovery showed first array pulled reel slowly steadily, sun reflecting gold-colored panel silvery telescope. Discovery 380 statute mile Earth, 70 mile higher shuttle ever flown. The orbit dictated need put telescope Earth's distorting atmosphere. Discovery's five astronaut awed view. I'd pas quote day on-board astronomer something effect big marble sure look far away today, Shriver said Hawley. Astronomers waited seven year Hubble take place space. The telescope originally scheduled launch 1983, technical problem Challenger explosion pushed back. The mission delayed another two week faulty power unit Discovery forced National Aeronautics Space Administration halt first launch attempt four minute April 10's scheduled liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted space, transporting Hubble world search others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door opened Friday, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Discovery Hubble case door open properly. If problem develops, McCandless Sullivan prepared walk space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said telescope would tested Thursday ability maneuever aperture door opened. We want full control ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, said. The telescope cannot focus sun sensitivity five instrument. If go well, crew land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects release first image telescope open star cluster constellation Carina Tuesday. Data follow month two. Astronomers hope look back almost beginning time, studying star galaxy distant light traveling Earth 14 billion year. They expect determine precisely universe formed, currently estimated 15 billion year ago. The telescope named late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, discovered 1920s universe expanding. He also responsible helping form Big Bang theory creation. Ground controller Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today two main antenna $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope trying six hour lock on. Applause erupted Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md., glitch marred Hubble's first full day space solved. We confirmation achieved communication Tracking Data Relay Satellite high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers said believed antenna working right problem incorrectly pointing either satellite TDRS, orbiting communication satellite act switchboard. In successful attempt, nearly doubled width antennas' beam take territory, sweep 6.2 degree 10.8 degree. The telescope's low-gain antenna, receive transmit information much slower rate used emergency, working well. Space shuttle Discovery 46 mile away, available remedy certain problem. The outage problem space walker would summoned. The five astronaut otherwise busy making picture storm Texas 380-mile-high perch, experiment. Steve Terry, director team calibrating various aspect telescope, said first outage caused human error serious problem. It began 1 1:30 am. EDT lasted 45 minute hour, said. The second failure occurred 6:44 am. controller attempted send signal telescope's two high-gain antenna TDRS. This time pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, Goddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft think inexperience dealing cause. The telescope, embarking 15-year search new world, released shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minute snag almost sent two astronaut emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awakened crew early today loud rendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite. Good morning, Discovery. I guess awake song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There lot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday Hubble good night asleep. We appreciate good word everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away telescope put shuttle series maneuver, last one completed morning, park Discovery orbit 46 mile Hubble. The telescope really looked great flew away it, sure hope good work, Shriver said Wednesday. Well, sure now, Loren, thanks great work done, replied Mission Control. Galileo real proud you. Scientists hailed Hubble NASA's expensive unmanned spacecraft greatest advance astronomy Galileo raised small telescope eye nearly 400 year ago. Discovery five astronaut follow telescope controller Goddard center make sure Hubble operating properly, responding directional command. The next milestone Friday, telescope's 10-foot aperture door opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Then Tuesday, NASA expects release first image telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina. Data follow month two. If aperture door open properly, Discovery could return telescope two astronaut could perform spacewalk fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said telescope would tested today ability maneuver aperture door opened. We want full control ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, said. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitive instrument. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used shuttle's 50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope hoist cargo bay. One telescope's solar array unreeled mast expected started providing power telescope's battery, otherwise eight hour charge. But trouble second panel. It budge latch released, moved fifth 39-foot length stopped again. The panel rolled way third attempt. By final attempt, astronaut Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan space suit airlock, 30 minute away taking tool hand going outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik said cause problem unknown. The 8{-hour procedure performed 380 mile Earth, 70 mile higher shuttle ever flown. The orbit dictated need put Hubble Earth's distorting atmosphere. Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost beginning time, studying star galaxy distant light taken 14 billion year reach Earth. They hope determine universe formed, currently estimated 15 billion year ago. The telescope originally scheduled launch 1983 delayed technical problem Challenger accident. Discovery, blasted orbit Tuesday, scheduled land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven year late, Hubble Space Telescope belongs, world search distant may formed beginning time. Less five hour rode space shuttle Discovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope sent first test radio signal. At sign life, applause cheer erupted Mission Control Houston. As tell, everything look perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesday drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space. Discovery, trailing arc white smoke brilliant blue sky, carried silver-colored telescope orbit 380 mile Earth higher 70 mile previous shuttle. There Hubble stay search yet-unseen wonder creation instrument look 14 billion year backward time. Our window universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted Discovery rose seaside launch pad. It's beautiful day Hubble Space Telescope orbit instead Earth many year, said NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's element I'm delighted. The telescope supposed launched 1983, technical problem Challenger accident delayed deployment. It suffered delay two week ago countdown stopped four-minutes-to-go point faulty hydraulic unit shuttle. While remained Earth, telescope cost $7 million month exercise keep readiness. In first day space, checkout testing continued remotely control Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland. On hand watch Discovery launching contingent scientist hailed Hubble greatest advance astronomy Galileo raised small telescope eye nearly 400 year ago. Truly referred early-day astronomer asked long delay getting telescope working station. Somebody day said, `Who remembers day Galileo picked telescope look stars?' said Truly, former shuttle astronaut. It matter day launch Hubble, matter right. The telescope 43 foot long 14 foot diameter, size railroad tank car. When fly free, receive electrical power six scientific instrument two wing-like solar array extend outward side. It named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, theorized universe expanding farther away galaxy is, faster traveling. That gave support theory massive explosion Big Bang created universe 10 20 billion year ago. The Hubble expected help provide answer two major questions: How old universe? How big it? The telescope two mirror, one 94.5 inch diameter, 12 inch. Two instrument camera, two spectrometer one photometer. In addition, fine pointing system act sixth instrument providing precise measurement distance. On Wednesday, Hawley grapple 12{-ton telescope shuttle's mechanical arm, lift cargo bay, point it, long checkout drop overboard orbit own. In cargo bay, telescope receives electrical power shuttle. But juice cut instrument lifted depend internal battery solar panel extended receive light sun. Should solar panel deploy, mission specialist Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan standing by, partially dressed space suit, ready go open cargo bay unfurl array manually. Discovery's launch problem. With 31 second left countdown, computer run final moment liftoff refused close fuel valve stopped launch process. The problem overcome shuttle lifted 8:34 am. EDT, three minute late. The shuttle scheduled land Sunday 9:49 am. EDT Edwards Air Force Base California. On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, shuttle's windshield splattered several fleck thing. He said windshield streaked debris also smeared spent booster rocket fell climb orbit. The astronaut also problem UHF radio circuit, one ship's small rear thruster inoperative. Neither problem considered serious. The shuttle put Hubble Space Telescope orbit also carry instrument used 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble: eyepiece world's powerful telescope. It's great pleasure something historical significance something directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contribution astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday circled Earth space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope carried orbit Sullivan. After brings eyepiece back Earth, placed display observatory. It's basically symbolic gesture astronomy future astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group run observatory, located San Gabriel Mountains Los Angeles. The discovery made Hubble 100-inch telescope Mount Wilson gave u giant leap forward understanding universe, McAfee said. We believe Hubble Space Telescope thing. The Hooker Telescope world's powerful telescope construction 1918 1948, 200-inch Hale Telescope placed operation Mount Palomar Observatory northeast San Diego. Using Hooker Telescope, Hubble first determine distance galaxy Milky Way, institute said statement. This crucial discovery provided first definite proof galaxy existed far confines local galaxy, institute said. During 1920s 1930s, Hubble assistant used Hooker telescope take thousand photograph faint galaxy, showing moving away quickly. This provided observational evidence concept, suggested Einstein's Theory Relativity, universe expanding, institute said. Hubble's work helped convince scientist universe created giant explosion, called big bang, estimated 15 billion year ago. The Hooker Telescope mothballed 1985 Carnegie Institution, former operator observatory, money-saving move. The institute hope obtain fund reopen it.

While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth, it will provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled.  Once released, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  However, scientists, optimistic that the Hubble will soon be operational, authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return home.","Following an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  Named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who did pioneering work leading to the ""Big Bang"" concept of the universe, it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime, it will provide astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.

Police said bomb exploded crowded trade residential district Bowbazaar shortly midnight, causing two block flat collapse trapping 70 people rubble. The identity bomber unknown explosion come five day 250 people killed least 1,200 injured series bomb attack aimed heart Indian business capital Bombay. A militant Sikh group fighting independence Indian state Punjab claimed responsibility Bombay blast, police unconvinced, saying carried foreign group connivance 'local criminals'. In many interpreted reference Pakistan, India fought three war, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, federal home (interior) minister, told parliament New Delhi suspected 'an international conspiracy.' Most estimated 125 people living Calcutta flat bed blast occurred, setting fire building, according official city's central control room. At least 45 people dead arrival hospital, said. Last Friday series car bomb exploded Bombay government described systematic attack India's commercial heart. Among target Bombay Stock Exchange, landmark Air India building, shopping complex, two hotel airport. The attack Calcutta Bombay severe setback attempt heal wound created recent intercommunal violence, caused deep shock throughout India. More 2,000 people died riot, including 700 Bombay, razing mosque Ayodhya northern India Hindu zealot December 6. Some fear wave bomb attack designed stir renewal communal strife undermine effort government Mr P V Narasimha Rao open economy attract foreign investment tourism. Last night national local state leader appealed calm attempt prevent renewed outbreak violence. Mr Rao urged nation ignore rumour 'inhuman criminal blast'. A ROW erupted Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, Securities Exchange Board India, security watchdog, board's recent first-ever inspection stockbrokers' book. The Sebi accused stockbroker flouting exchange's rule, including regulation margin trading designed limit risk member defaulting excessive speculative investment. It also accused exchange authority failing enforce rule poor administration. The stock exchange denied allegation, saying 'baseless, made context blown proportion.' The argument nothing restore investors' faith stock market where, measured Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, share fallen 48 cent peak early last year, including 320 point fall government's budget announced two week ago. Yesterday index closed 2330. Foreign investor, wooed India source much-needed capital, also concerned latest allegation poor management exchange. In one damaging passage, inspectors' report alleges D S Prabhoodas, leading firm headed Mr Hemendra Kothari, former BSE president, Mr Jaswant Chotalal, member BSE's governing body, avoided margin payment totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 408m). Mr Kothari said yesterday transaction covered report off-exchange deal directly financial institution margin payment required.

All taken place volatile background: Bombay equity market, six week so, contend first unusually bullish speculation, national budget February 27, subsequently savage expression disappointment. Dr Manmohan Singh, Indian finance minister, disappointed trader budget end last month. He postponed corporate tax reform year, denying hope tax cut recommended expert group. He reduce excise import duty broad front, left cement steel sector, share price boosted pre-budget speculation. To top all, Dr Singh refused equate domestic investor overseas counterpart taxing short-term capital gain. He lowered tax 30 cent 65 cent expatriate Indians foreign investor local investor remained 44.5 cent. Taking tax concession granted, trader driven share price February make kill later. Instead, budget turned nightmare. While industry business welcomed statement which, once, propose new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, stock market theorist academic, said reduction import duty would leave corporate profit ex-growth year. The relative lack financial concession meant disappointed trader sold vengeance and, weekend, market seemed bottomless equity price plummeted 13-month low. Overseas investor fuelled downtrend sold half million share Reliance Industries, arbitraging share price Bombay stock exchange market price Euro-issue global depository receipt (GDRs).

Last week, the Securities and Exchange Board of India completed its first inspection of the books and accused the market of ignoring and failing to enforce rules.  This is just the latest dispute between the government and the troubled BSE.  The Indian market already had fallen 48 percent since early last year, aggravated by a negative reaction to the Indian budget, which helped foreign and expatriate investors, but did not provide the expected tax relief to local industry.  On Friday afternoon, the BSE, along with other Bombay commercial centers, was hit with car bombs.  These attacks struck at the heart of India's commerce, seemingly aimed at undermining government efforts to expand foreign investment and tourism.

It suggested recording prime minister's conversation Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, Major used variety four-, six- eight-letter word communicate lack fondness certain colleague, may good. With luck, reckoned, Major's image leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction. What piffle. Major gonner, especially week's revolt wooden-tops Christchurch by-election, Conservative majority 23,015 last year's general election converted 16,427 majority Liberal Democrats. Fifteen month late, voter Christchurch rounded Tories malignant squeaky fury. In reality, politician, Major, far candid salty chatting private speaking public. In public, careful say, utterance achieve horrible mattness. But private relax. Their syntax disappears. Their word become nonsensical. They swear joke shout. It really spectacle. To show I mean, I spoke yesterday John Major John Smith. Smith, Scot, leader Labour Party, though many people know that. In aftermath Christchurch, Labour lost deposit, I wanted provoke two Johns spot real soul-searching. To guarantee privacy, I used signal-scrambler. No one could eavesdropped. Their response true form. But I left swear-words new Financial Times Style Guide state 'the gratuitous use expletive obscenity discouraged . . . Four-letter expletive confined infrequent use review (Arts) pages.' I live that, though artsy-fartsies receive dispensation puzzle. First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did read, John, Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson Robert Solow wrote, one article, FT week? They describing Europe's lunatic monetary policy exchange rate arrangement. They pull punch. I bet went chalk-white. 'So walk plank, John? You unpopular prime minister start fourth century. Why invite punishment? Unfairly not, drawing blame life's unpleasantness, let alone cock-ups.' 'Are sure?' prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load . . . let put - economy, course . . . I mean, wimpy guy me. But I'm giving that, . . .' On went. Then I rang John Smith. I told I impressed interview Andrew Marr The Independent Thursday, sharpened promise introduce meaty political reform (if ever get elected), including referendum proportional representation. I said: 'You starting raise game, John. Many people agreed assertion democracy Britain decaying, Tories must roasted arrogance, incompetence, complacency sharp practice - especially 'centralisation power elimination opposition'. But critic still accuse you, John, laziness ineffectualness. What say that?' 'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted Labour leader. 'Gie o'wit an' sense life, behint kist lie an' sklent.

But I raise energy. Last year biography Mrs Norma Major - or, old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed Majors' favourite film Being There. I entirely concur choice. In case see marvellous film, this, essence, plot: man one know anything about, gardener called Chauncey, rise trace become, end film, serious candidate US presidency. Chauncey, played Peter Sellers, utters mundane sentiment halting monotone convinces Republican party's power broker sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromide everyone seems hear want believe. He deadly innocence. No wonder Majors liked film. John Major must, level, appreciated similarity own, strangely intangible, rise Chauncey's. If see similarity, still revealing. Do protest urban John Major could identify gardener. In interview Farmers Weekly, day ago, Major disclosed unknown fact: father farmer. Farmers Weekly, see, asked Major 'such obvious empathy agriculture'. (Well, obvious Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father farmer. He lived small farm somewhere Shropshire.' Francis Wheen The Guardian, keen student Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, claimed Major's father farmed Bromsgrove 1910. As Wheen pointed out, Major unresponsive 33 year old time, - minor point - Bromsgrove Shropshire. This, course, mean Major made everything up. Family folklore peculiar thing. Yet I heard this, mind immediately went back incident month ago, Major visited Pittsburgh, centre US steel industry, part American tour. I recall made great hit recounting father steelworker city. A farmer Farmers Weekly, Pittsburgh steelworker American audience . . . pattern emerges. Major's father, therefore extension John Major himself, thing people. If John Major different sort politician, would point barely worth making. But seem piece Major's approach wider political issue. On one hand appeal pro-Europeans party claiming want Britain heart Europe. On free insulting reference European Commission, whenever necessary appeal audience Euro-sceptics. There argue merely mean Major typical democratic politician, one want become prime minister democracy must recognise many constituency interest, one. But true Major's recent Conservative predecessor. Margaret Thatcher notoriously dogmatic, public, Edward Heath, though always pretended 'consensus politician'. No, Major's technique much invention, much reflection particular character, product unsettled family background. His father, Tom Major-Ball, itinerant figure, moving place place, trying hand number occupation, including circus. No wonder young John Major learned skill fitting prevailing circumstance, matter fluctuating. The problem old one: cannot fool people time. Except movie. Dominic Lawson editor The Spectator ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone winning general election. His honeymoon, personal victory, short-lived begin second year hard-won term deeply unpopular leader everything still prove. The 12 month hijacked internal party difference Europe, debacle surrounding UK withdrawal exchange rate mechanism European Monetary System, continuing, deep recession disappointed alienated many traditional Tory supporter business. Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday outbreak political point-scoring government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader Commons, conceded: 'No one pretend last year easy,' also claimed much achieved. The government's effort secure framework long-term prosperity beginning pay off. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, joined 10 frontbench colleague launching counter-attack, involving detailed documented indictment Mr Major's failure. He attacked Tories building 'a bonfire pre-election commitments'. Tory allegiance business world also put immense pressure, though criticism policy drift inaction may soften recession end. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president Confederation British Industry, remained cautious volunteered: 'If I betting man I would say embryo recovery.' Mr Major take little comfort conclusion, widespread industrialist, greatest achievement year Britain's withdrawal ERM - something resisted which, end, control. Most industrialist, however, find hard criticise Mr Major individual, many drawing flattering parallel personal quality predecessor. He still attracts gratitude election victory, seen - subsequent problem economy - best result business. But, previous No 10 occupant, seen weak leader, little vision bereft clearly articulated political conviction.

One editorial claims some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major, and there is speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher when she resigned under pressure in November 1990. After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift.

Mr. Major had little time to enjoy his victory as public opinion of him soon soured. While seen as gentler than his abrasive predecessor, he is viewed as timid and indecisive. Almost from the first he has been beset by scandal in his cabinet and a number of controversies ranging from internal party differences over Europe to the debacle surrounding Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System to a deep and continuing recession.

Investigators say Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in an attempt to deal with crushing debts. Some $630 million was taken from his Mirror Group pension fund without authority. His sons Kevin and Ian, who took over the business, were investigated and found guilty for their knowledge of illegal schemes using two Swiss trusts, a private UK trust company and a US investment bank to support the Maxwell Communications Company (MCC).

But, tragic sinking Estonia loss 800 life demonstrates, go toll human life high. As ferry increase size, number board risk mechanical failure crew error go up. The move roll-on roll-off ferry vehicle deck run entire length vessel increased risk that, sea penetrates hold bow door gash ship's side, lead vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) member, ship-owning nation, devoted much thought two decade ship safety. But sinking Estonia lead new review ferry safety. Particularly worrying eyewitness report suggest water penetrated bow door manner reminiscent sinking Herald Free Enterprise 1987. Unlike Herald, Estonia appears door closed, ro-ros undoubtedly vulnerable water penetration. Any review ferry safety focus three main issue. First subject ferry design reconsidered. Additional stability could provided addition sponsons, stabilising bulge project ship's side water line. Greater resistance influx water could obtained installing moveable barrier bulkhead break large car deck. These proposal looked British government wake sinking Herald Free Enterprise. It calculated would cost Pounds 70m Pounds 85m improve standard 57 vessel UK ferry fleet, Pounds 22m extra annual running cost. Higher cost would inevitably lead higher fare - unwelcome ferry operator when, short cross-Channel route, face competition Channel tunnel. But difficulty pushing fare rise would nothing damaging ferry company another disaster. Second, IMO national government must look closely improve enforcement existing regulation. The IMO trying move enforcement agenda, depends good professionalism government shipowner. Third, IMO given support national government campaign, launched yesterday, improve crew training. Much regulation recent year concentrated improving ship equipment. Above all, new regulation turn necessary, must introduced speedily. As thing stand, take year change ratified enough government give force. The European Union, Sweden Finland getting ready join, could take lead speeding process. Ship safety not, course, issue ferry sector. Five (small) ferry lost last year, according Lloyd's Register. But figure pale insignificance compared 96 general cargo ship 12 tanker also went down. When cargo vessel third-world crew go distant ocean, little attention paid. If loss relatively modern passenger vessel European water make shipping safety higher priority government public, small compensation loss life Estonia.

Some major oil importers had already embargoed Iraqi oil. Oil prices soared.The United States moved an aircraft carrier into the Arabian Sea. Iraq warned its people of a possible United States attack. President Bush only said that all options were open.","Iraq's powerful army invaded Kuwait early on 2 August 1990. The small Kuwait army offered little resistance. Kuwaiti government buildings were occupied and 350 Iraqi tanks swept toward the southern oilfields. The invasion followed Hussein's claim that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area, and exceeded OPEC production quotas. Kuwait dismissed Iraq's claim that a Kuwaiti revolutionary group invited the invasion. Iraq had signaled the coming of the invasion by moving 100,000 troops to the border, and CIA warned that it might well occur.The United Nations Security Council immediately condemned the invasion, and on 6 August voted 13-0 to impose sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq.

It claimed to have responded to a request by a Kuwaiti revolutionary group.  A skeptical U.S. and U.N. rejected this justification, condemned the action, demanded withdrawal, and threatened sanctions.  The beleaguered Kuwaiti government requested U.S. military intervention.  Divided Arab nations failed to resolve the crisis. After further Iraqi intransigence, strong U.N. economic and military sanctions were imposed, including a ban on Iraqi oil and imports.  The price of oil soared.  Iraq responded by rounding up foreigners in Kuwait, sending some to Baghdad, and alerting its citizens to a possible U.S. attack.","Iraq ended its 1980-1988 war with Iran in debt for about $80 billion.  On July 17, 1990 Iraq provoked a major crisis by accusing Kuwait of costing it billions by exceeding Kuwait's OPEC assigned oil production quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, by stealing Iraqi oil from a disputed border oil field, and also by demanding repayment of a $15 billion war debt.  After Egyptian and Saudi Arabian mediation failed, Iraq invaded Kuwait with 100,000 troops led by 350 tanks.  It quickly overran Kuwaiti defenses and continued south to the oil fields.  Kuwait leaders, including the emir, escaped to Saudi Arabia.  They appealed for U.S. military intervention.  The Pentagon diverted an aircraft carrier group toward the gulf.  A U.S. led U.N. resolution demanded that Iraq immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Kuwait.  Iraq responded that it invaded at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had already overthrown the government of Kuwait and this was not a U.N. matter.  The U.N. rejected this justification as a farce and imposed strong economic and military sanctions after Iraq failed to withdraw.

Super Bowl XXV will be held in Tampa Stadium and will feature local entertainment designed to resolve area racial disputes. For Super Bowl XXVII, the Rose Bowl is being offered rent free to the NFL.","The San Francisco 49ers won the 1989 and 1990 Super Bowls, marking four out of four wins and setting several players' records. The 1990 Super Bowl was the lowest rated in 21 years, although the most watched TV event of the week.Super Bowl XXV, to be held in Tampa in 1991, will feature local events planned by a committee headed by two black men in order to resolve an area racial dispute. Only 80% of the face value of Super Bowl tickets can be deducted now. The Rose Bowl is being offered rent free to the NFL for Super Bowl XXVII.","The San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl in 1989 and 1990 marking the fourth win in four tries. Super Bowl records were set by the 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and wide receiver Jerry Rice. President Bush congratulated the 1989 victors at an East Room reception.Super Bowl XXIV (1990) was the most watched TV event of the week although it was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 21 years. Anheuser Busch Cos., Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., taking advantage of weeks of hype, staged mock football games in TV commercials using animated beer bottles.Super Bowl XXV will kickoff in Tampa Stadium in 1991. It will feature an extravaganza with marching bands, a street festival and floats. Two black men were named to head a community relations committee in order to resolve a local racial dispute. Several minority-owned business won lucrative contracts with the NFL.New tax lows place higher restrictions on what can be claimed as business-entertainment expense. For Super Bowl events, this means only 80% of the face value of tickets can be deducted. For Super Bowl XXVII in 1993, the Rose Bowl is being offered rent free to the NFL, along with all income from concessions and novelty sales.",Communities Offer Incentives for Super Bowl; 49ers Dominate Decade,"The Super Bowl is big. The viewing audience is large, and Beer companies spend millions on game-related ads. Communities offer rent-free stadium use to lure the game. Tighter tax laws haven't diminished corporate attendance. In Tampa 1991, the black community shared in the profits.San Francisco has four Vince Lombardi Trophies.","Super Bowl XXIV gave the 49ers their fourth Vince Lombardi Trophy. Sixty-three percent of TV viewers watched the lopsided game which also featured the conclusion of the ""Bud Bowl II,"" a $7 million Anheuser Bush ad campaign. Though the game can spotlight a community's problems, it also has tremendous economic impact. Communities such as Los Angeles--Orange County, therefore, offer incentives, such as rent-free stadium use, to lure the game to their city. Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

The resulting portrait dissipated ogre can't spell duly presented hardback form public, turn shocked disgusted force buy biography million. A can't-miss formula, surely. Albert Goldman's previous victim genre Elvis Presley. Now Mr. Presley wa, forgive expression, fat target writer Mr. Goldman's method. His title notwithstanding, ""King Rock 'n' Roll"" truth creature old show biz, star whose wholesome image, carefully created PR. wizard, ripe debunking. But choosing Mr. Lennon next target, Mr. Goldman appears trying debunk undebunkable. For apart puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic thousand interview gave squalid history: His voracious drug use, perfidy employee, unquenchable sexual promiscuity on. By accounting, then, Mr. Lennon dethrone Ward Cleaver all-American dad. His public loved spite -- perhaps all. Mr. Lennon grew celebrity time transgression intemperance adultery (quaint terms!) losing social sting. His candor -- that's wa, simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything. And ground insufficient candor resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot debunk, attack subject. The leitmotif Mr. Lennon's confession worst day him, Yoko Ono last learned prize virtue quietude domesticity. Now Mr. Goldman announce: He tell half it. Hence 718-page stew unrelieved sordidness, percolating ""scoops"" widely publicized People magazine, ""West 57th"" scholarly venues: Mr. Lennon thing young boys; marriage Ms. Ono pocked faithlessness rancor characterized first marriage; sweet tooth quit. The squalid revelation dribble chemical leak, sliming every page. Remarkably, then, sleazemonger's art triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon worse John Lennon's John Lennon. A great deal muck manages splash Ms. Ono, Mr. Goldman portrays cynical manipulator whose major talent lay exploiting Mr. Lennon craving fame wealth. Mr. Goldman, ala, allows pas unremarked obvious irony rather fine thumbnail sketch well. The keeper Lennon flame course quick point out. Ms. Ono son taken path preferred offended celebrity, hit talk show display wound. And Rolling Stone magazine, long house organ Lennon publicity machine, recently published extensive rebuttal book, undercut tone priggish indignation bordering comic. Criticizing ""The Lives John Lennon"" insufficient respect fallen Beatle's legacy rather point -- condemning Charles Manson bad table manner. The book may indeed inaccurate, critic charged. But one hope quibble veracity obscure countless reason hate Mr. Goldman's book. There is, starter, sloppy, pompous prose, suggestive grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman sort writer refers pop song ""pieces,"" though concerto. There knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- drug, sex, music -- give license second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. And awkward organization, minor event assume large proportion simple reason reflect badly Mr. Lennon, major event skipped lightly -- go advance! -- might reveal Mr. Lennon flattering light. All indicates ""The Lives John Lennon"" wretched book: make good man look bad, show purpose make man -- whether good man bad one, layman probably never know -- look bad.

The relatively low casualties were a result of an accurate prediction of the point of windfall by hurricane forecasters, effective evacuation measures and good response from residents. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion, by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area, but insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims.","Hurricane Hugo approached the Carolina coast on Sept. 21, 1989 with its windspeed up to 125 mph and threatened to hit between Savannah, GA and Charleston, S.C. It hit Charleston head-on with winds of 135 mph and then proceeded northwestward hitting other population centers rather than heading up the coast or out to sea as expected. Fortunately Hurricane forecasters analyzing computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane made an accurate educated guess as to the point of landfall in time for threatened residents to evacuate. As a result, only 17 deaths resulted in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston which took the brunt of the storm. Charleston had been through many hard times in its 300- year history, but Hugo was by far the worst hurricane in its experience. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion but insurers were confident that they could handle all claims. Disaster aid came to Charleston from an unexpected source.

The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,

Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking head springboard, coming back win two gold medal? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, two-inch fingernail raking air 100-meter sprint? But two, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, women's heptathalon long jump, may find difficult previous year turn gold medal gold bank. The fact is, say many marketer, Olympic gold lost much commercial luster. ""I think big money used be,"" say Michael Goldberg National Media Group Inc., New York sports-marketing firm represents Ms. Retton. ""It used kind knee-jerk reaction ad campaign Olympic athlete. It happen anymore."" Certainly, year's winning Olympians trouble securing contract specialized sports-equipment outfitter speaking invitation obscure trade group. But major, high-paying endorsement -- soft-drink company fast-food outlet -- seem surfacing, least yet. Earlier year, sport marketer estimated gold medal Summer Games could earn personable athlete $1 million endorsement. Now, marketer say, medalist lucky pull $100,000 $500,000 year. Advertisers reel litany reason Olympics igniting much spark. For one thing, suffer comparison 1984 Summer Games, exciting held Los Angeles because, absence boycotting Soviet-bloc country, Americans 83 gold medal. The 1988 Games, contrast, broadcast halfway world, Soviets trounced Americans, 55 gold medal 36. What's more, marketer say, year's drug scandal cast pall Games, especially incident involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, lost gold medal testing positive steroid. NBC's TV coverage also get share blame. Marketers say bland skipped frequently one event another little chance excitement build. The constant commercial interruption, led rating much lower expected, help, either. During Games, ""there enough continuous TV coverage that, much soap opera, possible get involved life competition,"" say Leigh Steinberg, attorney ice-skater Brian Boitano, gold medalist 1988 Winter Games. But summer, say. Recent change Olympic rule, meanwhile, led glut Olympians search endorsement deal. Before 1984 Games, Olympic athlete allowed make commercial unless gave amateur status. Now, appear many ad want, income must go trust fund training expense. ""Every year, Olympic people wanting commercial -- basically, everybody available,"" say Daisy Sinclair, vice president ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As result, ""aura"" surrounded Olympian, ""the bloom off."" Companies also becoming sophisticated approach celebrity endorsement. Increasingly cost conscious, longer hook Olympian company president like athlete's sport. And year paying big buck Olympic star see fade obscurity, company finally gotten hint Olympian fame fleeting variety. ""If think phone ring hook (you win) gold medal, going happen anymore,"" say Stephen Disson, senior vice president marketing ProServ Inc., Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies know ""six month hero sporting events"" consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude Olympics becoming typical. It us sport star commercial Pepsi Light Oppenheimer Mutual Funds plan call 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer use athlete public eye regular basis, football basketball players,"" say Charles Miesmer, agency's executive creative director. ""People Michael Jordan 10-plus year sport career, row, I worry public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And look 1988's winner start showing Wheaties box, either. General Mills Inc., featured Ms. Retton decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner Wheaties box past, say look three quality endorser: career achievement, popular appeal off-the-field accomplishment. A spokeswoman say none year's crop meet three criterion. So far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee visible endorsement. Even Olympics began, made commercial Primatene mist 7-Up. And, according agent, Pearl Hodge World Class Management, ""in process"" signing McDonald's Corp., work behalf effort aid underprivileged child. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take endorsement lead. Advertisers say good look fashion flare, attracting interest medal winner. (The sprinter's manager reached comment.) Another Olympian endorsement potential swimmer Matt Biondi, five gold medal. Mr. Biondi already signed swim-wear contract Arena USA Inc., Parkes Brittain, agent Advantage International Inc., say client ""will definitely high-income ring, highest name."" Then Mr. Louganis. Since winning two gold medal 1984 Summer Olympics, diver little luck major endorsement. And marketing executive say second sweep diving event may potential. ""When advertiser looking male hero, word 'macho' trail closely,"" say Marty Blackman Blackman & Raber, sports-marketing firm New York. ""I find Louganis macho guy."" Still, marketing professional say Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery smashing head secured diver's future. His manager, Jim Babbitt, comment contract offer. He say, however, client ""done fine. He unhappy.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing groupof runners in those events.In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured manysuccessful Olympic athletes.",,,,

Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo. Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.",Hurricane Hugo Could Have Been Deadlier. Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.",,,,

The jury acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 counts and deadlocked on 13.  The case began in 1983 and became a frenetic witch-hunt led by the California media.  At one time, seven defendants, 135 charges, and over 400 children were involved.  Following the verdict, defendants wept, while parents decried the system for failing their children.  The judge was not surprised.  Jurors faulted the children's videotaped interviews, saying the interviewer asked leading questions.  Jurors believed some may have been molested, but the prosecution failed to prove the defendants responsible.  The therapist conducting the interviews defended her technique.  The current and former Los Angles district attorneys blamed each other and denied their ambitions influenced the case.  The pre-school's neighbors were disappointed and concerned about the building.Reverberations will continue.  Several books and television movies are planned, although the response of the networks is not known.  Two civil suits by former defendants are underway and Mrs. Buckey said she plans to sue.  Parents of the children may decide to file civil charges because the burden proof is lower.

The case originally involved Buckey and his mother, as well as his sister and grandmother and three other employees of the school. The charges against the sister, grandmother and the three employees were dropped for lack of evidence. In reaching their verdict, the jury said that the videotaped interviews of the child were a factor in finding the Buckeys innocent. The jurors felt the interviewers asked leading questions and never allowed the children to tell their own story. A number of the jurors stated that they believed some of the children had been molested but that the prosecution had not proven that Raymond Buckey was responsible. The verdict was greeted with anger by the parents of the children involved who felt the prosecution and the legal system had let them down.

It quickly overran the Kuwaiti capital and then continued on to southern oil facilities.  The United States led the United Nations in condemning this action and imposing tough economic and military sanctions.","Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions by exceeding OPEC production quotas thus driving down oil prices.  He further accused Kuwait of ""stealing"" Iraqi oil from a common oil field on their border.  He then invaded Kuwait, claiming to do so at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  The United States led the western world and the United Nations in calling the coup a sham, denouncing this invasion and imposing strong economic and military sanctions on Iraq in an attempt to get them to withdraw.  Oil prices surged while Saddam warned against foreign intervention.  The U.S. dispatched warships to the area.","It appeared that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his countries financial problems and territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  Iraq emerged from its 1980-1988 war with Iran with a debt of approximately $80 billion.  Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions in oil revenues by exceeding OPEC assigned oil quotas, thus driving down the price of oil.  He further accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from an oil field common to their border and also of conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq economically and militarily.  Breaking off perfunctory negotiations with Kuwait, Iraq invaded, claiming it responded to a request for help from Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  Iraq quickly overwhelmed a mismatched Kuwaiti military, captured the capital and continued south to the oil facilities.  The United States called the coup a farce.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador asked the United States to intervene militarily.  U.S. President George Bush called for an ""immediate and unconditional"" withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  Although not willing to publicly discuss military options, Bush said all U.S. options remained open.  His administration led a United Nations embargo of Iraqi exports, including oil, and Iraqi imports.  Iraq retaliated by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait.",Saddam Hussein Defied United States and United Nations,"On August 2, 1990, after Saddam Hussein had charged Kuwait with unfriendly acts, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic moves by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq remained defiant and moved troops toward the Saudi Arabian border. As of August 6, 1990 the situation was ominous.","In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border. The two countries agreed to talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives walked out. The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of them to Iraq. As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.","On July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPECproduction quotas and of stealing oil from wells along the countries'disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a""short-notice exercise"" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would notbe intimidated by U.S. pressure. Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwaitagreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq hadmassed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. The next day Iraq pulledout of the talks and on August 2,1990 invaded and quickly occupied allof Kuwait. President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blockedmost Iraqi imports. The U.N. Security Council denounced the invasionand demanded Iraq's withdrawal. The Pentagon stepped up air patrolsand movement of warships into the Persian Gulf. When, on August 6, theU.S.  pushed strong sanctions against Iraq through the U.N. SecurityCouncil, Iraq struck back, rounding up several hundred Britons,Americans, and West Germans in Kuwait, taking some of them toIraq.

42,d075b,"The expensive practice using ballooncatheters force open heart artery immediately heartattacks, routinely done many large hospital, unnecessaryand abandoned, according major study released Tuesday.The study found heart attack victim quickly receiveclot-dissolving drug, need extra step thecommon balloon procedure, known angioplasty.Some expert said result good news, meanthat heart attack patient treated communityhospitals, angioplasty available.The study also important financial message. Its authorsestimated angioplasty widely adopted heartattacks, could raise nation's annual medical bill $704million.This trial settled one important question inmodern-day cardiology, commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy theUniversity Washington, Seattle.The study phase 2 Thrombolysis Miocardial InfarctionTrial, TIMI-II, directed Dr. Eugene Braunwald Brigham andWomen's Hospital Boston.The first phase study showed giving people aclot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, TPA,immediately heart attack dramatically improved chancesof survival.The latest study, presented annual meeting AmericanHeart Association, intended see whether people betterstill doctor tried clear away remaining blockage aftergiving TPA.At 50 hospital United States, doctor randomlyassigned 1,636 patient get angioplasty two day theirheart attack test showed chance mightbenefit. Sixty percent actually underwent procedure,which temporarily inflates balloon dangerously narrowed heartarteries squeeze open.A comparison group 1,626 also got TPA. But notconsidered angioplasty unless lingering heart pain orabnormal exercise test recovery.After 42 day, 11 percent angioplasty group haddied suffered heart attack, 10 percent thosein comparison group.A year treatment, difference survival.About 93 percent group still alive.There appear additional benefit fromangioplasty, Braunwald saidDr. Thomas J. Ryan Boston University Medical Center commented,We answer trial important question ofhealth care delivery.While small hospital give clot-dissolving drug heartattack patient, sophisticated labswhere angioplasty performed.If study found immediate angioplasty improvessurvival, would meant many angioplasty lab wouldneed established doctor trained give theprocedure.The watch word watchful waiting see patient needangioplasty. This ultimately make possible patient betreated community hospital transfered terciary carecenters angioplasty needed, said Dr. Howard Morgan,immediate president heart association.Heart attack occur clot block artery feed theheart muscle. The purpose TPA similar drug dissolvethese clot muscle dy. To effective, drug mustbe given four hour start heart attacksymptoms.Experts say 20 percent heart attack victimsare considered candidate drug. Many people delaygoing hospital permanent damage occurs. In others, thetreatment may considered dangerous recent surgeryor history strokes.Balloon angioplasty also widely used treat people withclogged heart artery suffered heart attack. Thelatest study question usefulness kind ofangioplasty.Deaths heart blood vesseldisease dropped 24 percent decade, remains byfar nation's biggest killer, taking life every 32 second, theAmerican Heart Association said Sunday.The good news continue see improvement thedeath rate biggest killer population, said Dr.Bernadine Healy Cleveland Clinic Foundation, presidentof heart association.Those trend dramatic seem reversing, shesaid. The bad news heart disease still killing almost 1million Americans year, we've got long way go.The association released statistic annual forum forscience writers.Experts attribute decline death rate combination ofhealthier living habit, including fewer cigarette better food,and improved medical treatment.The public ought appreciate progress madein heart disease 20 year, said Dr. Myron L.Weisfeldt Johns Hopkins University. It's almost unbelievable.There almost form heart disease can't approachwithout meaningful treatment.However, Weisfeldt, president-elect heartassociation, also cautioned much work remains, inimproving care encouraging people take better care theirhealth.I believe prevent least 50 percent ischemicheart disease United States year 2000 stopsmoking, get cholesterol treated 220, identify andtreat hypertension, said.Ischemic heart disease clogging blood vessel feedthe heart. It underlies heart attack, single lethalheart ailment.Association figure indicated 1986 recent yearfor statistic estimated 978,500 Americans diedfrom heart attack, stroke disease heart andblood vessel. Cancer, No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.Between 1976 1986, death rate form ofcardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It declined 28 percent forheart attack 40 percent strokes.The association's figure show one fourAmericans suffers form cardiovascular disease, almosthalf eventually die it.About 60 percent heart attack death occur thevictim reach hospital. Studies show half allheart attack victim wait two hour getting anemergency room.Weisfeldt said major health goal getting people go thehospital three four hour first sign heartattacks. During period, still time give drugsto dissolve blood clot causing heart attacks.This treatment life reduce disability heartattacks.Other major goal, said, include finding way improve theeffectiveness angioplasty, technique us balloon openclogged heart artery, finding surgical medical techniquesto identify protect people risk cardiac arrest.The heart association estimate cardiovascular disease willcost $88.2 billion year medical expense lost wages.Among statistic released association:The common cardiovascular disease high blood pressure,which affect 60 million Americans.About 200,000 death cardiovascular disease eachyear occur people age 65.There 1,418 heart transplant 1987, almost nine time asmany 1983.About 2.5 million Americans angina, chest painresulting clogged heart artery. About 300,000 new case occurannually.As many 1.5 million Americans heart attack thisyear.A drug eas heart's workload cancut risk new cardiac attack death 20 percent inpeople recovering heart attack, according major studyreleased Thursday.The study, conducted Denmark, found drug Verapamil,known calcium channel blocker, effective 1{ yearsafter heart attack. Calcium blocker several class ofmedicines commonly prescribed relieve high blood pressure.This first trial indicates calcium blockermay beneficial acute myocardial infarction, heartattack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine University Florida.Several study calcium blocker, including one largeUS. study published last year, failed find benefit fromusing medicine heart attacks.According Danish study, Verapamil effectiveas another variety blood pressure medicine known betablockers protecting people heart attacks.While calcium blocker may replace beta blocker heartattacks, researcher said drug still rolein treatment.We feel important alternative. Many patient donot tolerate beta blocker, said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard ofCentral County Hospital Hillerod, Denmark, co-author thestudy.Beta blocker generally recommended people withasthma emphysema. This mean drug cannot given tocigarette smoker, frequent victim heart attacks.In study, conducted 20 community hospital, doctorscompared 897 patient got Verapamil heart attack with878 people took placebos.After 18 month followup, 146 death recurringheart attack Verapamil patient, compared 180 inpeople got dummy medication.We wanted see effect would observed withVerapamil, said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen Copenhagen MunicipalHospital.If effect, seen first 12 18months, big increase mortality myocardialinfarction period, said. Then level off. That'swhat demonstrated. It worked.The researcher believe reducing amount workneeded heart sustain circulation, calcium blockerslowered chance ischemia, episode heart's ownmuscle deprived oxygen.They said unsure earlier study failed showany benefit calcium blocker heart attack. However,they noted study enrolled patient also takingbeta blocker. And might obscured benefit fromcalcium blockers.The result presented meeting American Collegeof Cardiology. Among research described meeting:Dr. James H. Chesebro Mayo Clinic said five-year studyfound aspirin stop continued buildup existingblockages artery feeding heart, although maymodestly protect development new deposit. However,like study, one found aspirin signficantly cutthe risk heart attacksDr. Eugene Braunwald Harvard Medical School said nextphase large study clot-dissolving drug see whateffect unstable angina. This condition whichpeople suffer spontaneous chest pain triggered workor stress. Until now, drug used treat heartattacks.An intestinal operation lower cholesterolof heart attack patient reduced risk another heartattack death heart disease, researcher said today.The surgery, called partial ileal bypass, one significantdrawback: It cause chronic diarrhea persists years.In operation, doctor change route smallintestine one-third bypassed. This reduces theamount cholesterol absorbed bloodstream.The $52 million, 17-year study conducted people hadalready suffered heart attack. The approach lengthened livesof people mild heart attack moresevere heart damage.During average 10 year follow up, death rate amongsurgery patient sustained minimal heart damage 24percent. In comparison group intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percentDr. Henry Buchwald University Minnesota, directedthe study, said surgery considered withcholesterol-lowering drug possible standard treatment.It role management patient highcholesterol heart attack, Buchwald said. It iseminently logical extend cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, patient high cholesterol hada heart attack.Besides diarrhea, undergo surgery somewhatmore prone kidney stone, gallstone intestinalobstructions.The study conducted Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia Little Rock, Ark., published today's NewEngland Journal Medicine.Despite wide acceptance cholesterol lowering, doubt remainabout whether actually help people live longer alreadyhave healthy heart. Although latest study conductedexclusively people suffered heart attack, Buchwald saidhe belief research settle question.It offer strongest justification marked lipid(cholesterol) ineervention ever offered, Buchwaldsaid. It powerful study should, certainpeople never satisfied, end cholesterolcontroversy.In study, 421 people recovered heart attacksunderwent surgery, comparison group 417 people weretreated diet alone. At start study, averagecholesterol level 251. The surgery lowered people'scholesterol 23 percent.The overall risk dying heart disease sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack reduced 35 percent thesurgical patient healthiest heart. The surgical patientsalso required le half many coronary bypass operationsbecause clogged heart arteries.New treatment stop heart attack itstracks may help victim get hospital quicklythan ever before, perhaps three day attack, astudy published today concludes.Doctors University Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effect sending carefully selected heart patient homeearly. They found people unusual complications,got back work sooner substantially lower medical bills.It extraordinarily safe strategy, said Dr. Eric J.Topol, study's director. There problem anyserious events.Topol said early discharge made possible two recentmedical advance tissue plasminogen activator, TPA, andangioplasty.When given quickly heart attack, TPA dissolve clotsin heart's artery minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar result opening clogged artery withtiny balloons.The report represents latest steady three-decade trendof sending heart attack patient home hospital evershorter stays.However, study New England Journal Medicine saidmore research needed finding widely adopted.In 1950s, doctor recommended patient stay inbed one two month heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffered uncomplicated heart attack in1955, spent seven week recovering hospital.However, doctor learned long inactivity harm thangood. Patients got shape, developed blood clot becamedemoralized.In 1960s, stay shortened three week the1970s two week. Now, doctor typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalized seven 10 days.In paper, doctor determined 80 507 heartattack patient studied healthy enough considered forearly discharge. None irregular heart beat, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill test showed sign heart attackdamage.Forty patient sent home three day, reststayed seven 10 day. After six month followup, none haddied, number medical problem group similar.However, people early discharge group able returnto work two week sooner others, medicalbills significantly lower $12,546 $17,868.The researcher estimated 15 percent heart attackpatients discharged three day, annual saving wouldbe least $280 million.In accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, deputyeditor journal, cautioned study largeenough spot complication might result reducinghospital stays.This single study, wrote, sufficient justifysweeping change current management practice patientswho may first appear uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors cautious prescribing aspirin preventer heart attack research support value, Food Drug Administration said. Taking aspirin prevent heart attack may increase people's chance dying thing, especially hemorrhagic stroke, agency said commentary today's Journal American Medical Association. The FDA persuaded aspirin maker March refrain promoting aspirin preventer first heart attack, least now. A study published January indicated aspirin every day reduced risk nonfatal, first heart attack 47% 11,000 male doctor five year, compared 11,000 took non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tends promote bleeding reducing ability blood platelet help form clot. Heart attack occur clot form artery nourishing heart choke blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risk people already clotting problem, high blood pressure, put increased risk hemorrhagic stroke, FDA commentary said. Strokes result brain damage caused bleeding brain blood clots; hemorrhagic stroke caused bleeding. The FDA commentary pointed 10 hemorrhagic stroke recorded 11,000 subject taking aspirin recent study, compared two stroke 11,000 subject taking substitute. Overall death rate two group same, though aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate much lower. There 104 nonfatal heart attack aspirin user 189 comparison group. ""Physicians, will, time, forced make professional judgment aspirin use basis incomplete information,"" said FDA commentary, co-written agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree completely,"" said Dr. Julie Buring, Harvard University researcher participated aspirin study. She added telephone interview yesterday extension study way, researcher expect report FDA late fall. The commentary noted British study, also released January, 5,000 male physician found aspirin failed protect heart attack, associated 2 1/2-fold increase disabling strokes.A drug used treat patient complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attack infour five heart patient, according study published intoday's edition New England Journal Medicine.Surprisingly, however, study found drug, diltiazem,increases chance subsequent heart attack patient whosehearts pump abnormally, expert said.Even so, result may trigger increase use thedrug, primarily used treat angina, doctor said.The drug tested 38 hospital United States andCanada patient recently suffered heart attack, saidDr. Arthur Moss, clinical professor medicine Universityof Rochester principal investigator study.The result suggest drug may quite effective indecreasing likelihood second heart attack majorityof patient, Moss said. But study also surprisingly suggeststhat patient suffer pulmonary congestion givendiltiazem drug increase chance subsequentheart attack.We know prescribe drug to,Moss said. That's study about.Diltiazem calcium entry blocker, newest class drugsto introduced fight heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blocker type commonly prescribed doctors.The study involved 2,466 heart attack patient, giveneither 240 milligram diltiazem day placebo. Patientswere recruited 1983 1986 followed 12 52 months.Overall, drug decreased additional heart attack 11percent, statistically significant, Moss said.But patient normal near-normal heart pumpfunction 1,909 patient 80 percent total group diltiazem decreased chance another heart attack 25percent, Moss said.In patient whose heart pumping problem, drug onlydidn't help, increased chance heart attack 25percentDr. John Schroeder, cardiologist professor StanfordUniversity, said surprised drug increased thechance heart attack group overall result werenot higher.But bottom line first study showthat diltiazem effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean patient routinely put drug ona long-term basisDr. George Beller, cardiologist professor theUniversity Virginia, said also somewhat surprised aboutthe increase heart attack group suffering pulmonarycongestion.This one first report seems identifythat, said.Diltiazem two calcium entry blocker introducedin decade, Beller said, research effectivethey various application early stages.Nitrates used 50 year, betablockers developed 1960s.Aspirin sale jumped 41 percent weeksearlier year, rash headaches.A study 22,000 male doctor shown taking asingle aspirin every day could cut heart attack risk half.The study one series recent report showing thefirst time doctor able treat heart attack also prevent them.In recent report, doctor found one aspirin tabletand single dose clot-dissolving drug given 24 hourscan dramatically cut risk second fatal heart attack.Without treatment, patient 13 percent chance dyingfrom second heart attack five week, researchersfound. With treatment, figure dropped 8 percent.The real discovery treatment patient going toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, say Richard Peto ofOxford University, one study's authors.Heart disease nation's leading cause death, far.The National Center Health Statistics report 762,820Americans died heart disease 1987.To put another way: Of 2,127,000 American died thatyear, one three died heart disease. (This notinclude died blood-vessel disease, strokes.)The drug responsible recent success preventingheart attack new clot-dissolvers old standby,aspirin.The usual cause heart attack blockage coronaryarteries, supply heart muscle oxygen-rich blood. Theblockage arises buildup fat, cholesterol clottedblood.Clot-dissolvers break clot, thus restoring blood flow.Aspirin interferes aspect clotting process, helping toprevent clot formation first place.The limited sale clot-dissolving drug UnitedStates show many doctor still using them, despitetheir proven success. But beginning change.Some doctor predict not-too-distant future thesedrugs judged safe administeredroutinely paramedic ambulance suspected heart attackvictims reach hospital.We know respond quickly, havethe courage use drug absence definitivediagnosis, say Dr. Burton Sobel Washington University St.Louis, pioneer testing clot-dissolvers.The important thing teach patient inadvance value early treatment, says.While public attention focused new ability toprevent heart attack, researcher also made importantprogress speeding recovery patient survive heartattacks.Researchers University Michigan recently determinedthat heart attack victim released hospital assoon three day heart attack. Most heart attacksvictims kept hospital least seven 10 days.The patient given early discharge able return worktwo week sooner study group. After six months,not one death recorded early-discharge group. Theresearchers concluded perhaps 15 percent heart attacksvictims could safely discharged three days.In July, Stanford University doctor found worker wentback job seven week heart attack didat least well worker went back typicalconvalescence 10 11 weeks.All advance come time public health expertsare increasingly emphasizing role good health goodnutrition lowering heart disease risk.Early next year, American Heart Association seal approvalwill begin appearing food low fat cholesteroland therefore help reduce heart disease riskUS. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop July issued firstreport nutrition, calling Americans lower theirconsumption fat eat vegetable, fruit, fish,poultry whole grains.The report likened first Surgeon Generals reporton smoking, issued 1964, focused public attention onsmoking's hazard. Koop's recommendation largely echo theAmerican Heart Association, help carry messageto many people.Progress research heart disease making clear theheart attack longer mysterious killer strike withoutwarning cannot defended against.Much done prevent heart attack, great improvementsare made treatment, recovery faster everbefore.The use clot-dissolver aspirin could, alone, save25,000 life year United States, doctor say.These result, say Dr. Peter Sleight Oxford University,will change medical practice worldwide.A natural substance called transforming growthfactor beta appears able limit damage cardiac cellsfollowing heart attack, according study published thejournal Science.In study Jefferson Medical College Philadelphia, agroup laboratory rat induced heart attack suffered 50percent le cell damage injection transforming growthfactor beta rat receive TGF beta.TGF beta growth factor opposes bad guysfollowing heart attack, said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, professor atJefferson.Lefer said research team simulated heart attack 24 ratsby partially blocking key artery hearts.In 12 rat, researcher injected placebo.

Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

Meanwhile vigorous lobbying of the entire Senate by pro- and anti-Thomas groups proceeded.","From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Thomas's refusal to answer certain questions caused complaints, but it appeared early on that the committee would approve the nomination. By the end of the questioning an affirmative vote of 10-4 or 9-5 was predicted. There was media attention to Thomas's wife Virginia. A successful Washington lawyer, she had taken strong conservative positions that antagonized certain groups and the fact that she was white and he black raised questions for some blacks. During the hearings lobbyists on either side worked to influence the ensuing vote of the full Senate.","From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, underwent five days of intensive questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Although it seemed likely that the committee would vote to confirm the nomination, some members complained that the candidate refused to answer certain questions and seemed to back away from statements that he had made in the past. By the end of the questioning it appeared that Thomas would be confirmed by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote. In the media Thomas's wife Virginia was presented as an issue. Virginia had an impressive career as a lawyer in Washington, often taking strong conservative positions. She is white while Clarence is black. Women's-rights activists objected to her opposition to comparable-worth legislation; some religious groups were wary of her anti-cult activities; and some blacks viewed the Thomases' marriage as indicating his rejection of the black community. Throughout the hearings the entire Senate came under pressure from groups supporting or opposing the nomination. Pro-Thomas groups included the Coalition for the Restoration of the Black Family and Society and the Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas. Opposing were the National Abortion Rights Action League and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.",Thomas' confirmation as second black justice in history of Supreme Court.,"Clarence Thomas completed five days of grueling days of testimony, apparently well on his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.

In 1988, 20,000 people attended Israel's dog of the year contest in Tel Aviv with 800 contestants representing over 50 breeds.  The event briefly outshone Israel's general election and the uprising known as the intefadeh.  The owners of one prize winning dog were embroiled in a law suit over whether the dog should be retired or not.  Stud fees were also at issue.Weimaraners served as both companions and models to a Manhattan artist.  One of the dogs has appeared on the television show Sesame Street and another was world famous when he died at the age of 11.  The Dog Fancier's Club organized an event in New York City to honor the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.   Bill McFadden, a professional dog handler for various owners has close to 100 champions a year.  He says he makes a good living, but the overhead is high and the hours are long.","Dog Shows - Bringing Out the Best of ""Man's Best Friend""","Dog shows throughout the world bring together hundreds if not thousands of contestants representing the world's 135 dog breeds.  Publicity stunts, professional handlers, sometimes the courts and possibly even violence may be involved.  Awards and glory await the champions.  Occasionally, some dogs manage to gain fame outside of the dog show scene.","From the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden, to Tel Aviv, Israel's violence threatened show, to the massive 2500 contestant show in Los Angeles, proud owners, or professional handlers such as Bill McFadden, let their pampered pouches strut their stuff for awards and glory.  For some dogs, shows aren't necessary to attain fame.  Police dog Nero, the NYPD's finest, was feted for apprehending more than 50 felons.  And photographer William Wegman's Weimaraners are, through his work, know to artists and children around the world.  And like other international championship events, sometimes lawyers and court are involved.","At dog shows throughout the world, proud owners compete their charges for the awards and glory that await the champions.  Prince, a fluffy, little Pomeranian, after winning at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden was honored at a lunch held at a Sardi's, a prominent New York City restaurant.  However, not all ""famous"" dogs are show dogs.  Sharing the limelight at Sardi's was Nero, New York City's top police dog.  Nero helped the police make hundreds of arrests and apprehend more than 50 felons.  And one need only look at the renown attained by photographer William Wegman's Weimaraners.  Artists worldwide know his dogs, as do children who watch ""Sesame Street"".  But it's the show dogs that crisscross the country to strut their stuff, sometimes as many as the 2,500 dogs representing 138 breeds that competed at the All Breed Dog Show and Obedience trials in Los Angeles.  Some may possibly go to Tel Aviv, Israel for its annual show.  Bill McFadden, a professional dog handler, works about 120 shows a year throughout the U.S., showing 20 to 25 dogs at each show.  Among those he shows is Kerrageen's Hotspur, the top award winning Kerry blue terrier of all time.",,,,

Some observer cite fact only257 director nominate Academy Awards, many areveterans might look kindly young man whose film arethe biggest moneymaker history (Jaws, E.T., Raidersof Lost Ark).The Academy appeared make amends last year presentingSpielberg Irving Thalberg award consistently highquality production. There mention fact thatSpielberg primarily director, producer.The Thalberg award come handy acknowledge giant whowere overlooked individual award. The recipient includedCecil B.

I'd blacken teeth first, quipped,alluding Academy's fondness actor portray bum anddowntrodden characters.Alfred Hitchcock also lighthearted comment hefailed win Oscar: I suppose matter ofcarelessness.The overlooking classic film industry's mosttalented filmmaker provided historian cause dispute.For example, Citizen Kane, customarily place No. 1 onpolls greatest American film, nominated 1941 forbest picture (there 10 nominee days), OrsonWelles' performance, direction co-scripting HermanMankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, art direction, sound,music editing.The Oscar Citizen Kane script.

Directors  Brooks (1988),  Spielberg (1988), and Lee (1989) are among the luminaries who were overlooked in the annual voting during the award's 61-year history.Millions watch the televised awards show which can take over three hours. The 1989 show is memorable for the number of films honored and for a musical number that sparked a Disney suit against the Academy.The highly recognizable statue is not protected by copyright. Walt Disney was the most-awarded person (32).","Director Spike Lee, speaking at Syracuse University Monday, shrugged off the treatment of his movie by Academy Award voters. Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories. The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers. In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.  Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting. On average a best picture award is worth about $20 million, but there is no guarantee that Academy members actually complete their own ballots.Millions watch the awards presentation. The last awards show took a long three plus hours. The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character. Though long, the 1989 ceremony will be favorably remembered for the spread of the awards. Ten movies split 17 awards. The Oscar, created in 1928, is one of the most recognizable symbols in the entertainment world and is not protected by copyright. Katherine Hepburn and Walter Brennan are the actress and actor, respectively, with the most awards.","High-stakes Oscar is prized, promoted, presented with pomp, and protected","Oscars increase film earnings, prompting studios to woo votes.

The Irving Thalberg award for consistently high quality has become useful for acknowledging overlooked giants and salving the academy's conscience. Steven Spielberg, never nominated for an individual achievement even though his films are record moneymakers, received it in 1987. 32-year-old Spike Lee blamed the paucity of nominations for his critically acclaimed ""Do the Right Thing"" on generational politics and racism.

Large crowds stood in line for hours atopenings in Belgrade, Moscow, and Peking. Customers in Yugoslavia, the firstcommunist country to get a McDonald's, and China raved about the taste of the Big Mac.In Moscow, the Russians were less enthusiastic about its taste but gave a thumbs up tothe shakes. The openings came after long negotiations which, in most cases, sawMcDonald's contracting with local farmers for the beef, potatoes and other suppliesneeded for its restaurants.","McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets. After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.

In Moscow thousands lined up for an opening day record of 30,000 meals being served at 27 cash registers.  Next, McDonald's opened in China, where cooking is a culinary art.  McDonald's worldwide restaurants are joint ventures with locals of the country in which they operate.","""Golden Arches"" continues its worldwide expansion.  In 1988, seven years after its first attempt to bring a restaurant to South Korea, McDonald's successfully joint-ventured with Ahn Hyo Young, a Harvard schooled entrepreneur. McAhn Enterprises Ltd. had to fight government red tape and develop local suppliers in order to open in Seoul.  That year, Big Mac also braved the communist world.  On March 24, 1988, McDonald's successfully opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  Its local competition was the hamburger-like pljeskavica, i.e., ground pork and onion served on bread and eaten by hand.  Two years later, McDonald's had their most successful opening ever, worldwide.  In Pushkin Square, Moscow, thousands of people waited in line for hours at the largest McDonald's in the world for hamburgers, fries and shakes.  This opening day ""Mac attack"" resulted in 30,000 meals being served over fourteen hours at 27 cash registers.  Customers were surprised and pleased to find efficient, friendly workers in this country of generally surly service.  And then, China, where cooking is a culinary art.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.  All European and Jewish issues were addressed.  Reunification occurred.",East's Economy Sagging. Soviets Endorse German Reunification. World Awaits Change,"Woeful economic conditions and massive demonstrations in East Germany gave impetusto German reunification. Soviet endorsement of reunification in 1990 made it imminent.Many perceived a strong unified Germany as a danger, but that was accepted as a lesserthreat than East Germany in turmoil.","East Germany was near chaos by the end of 1989. Woeful economic conditionsprevailed. Massive demonstrations for democratic reform swept the nation. The hard-lineCommunist government admitted its failure, giving strong impetus to the Germanreunification movement. The Soviets endorsed it in February as the World War II Alliesdid later. Unification was now imminent.The specter of an economically and politically powerful Germany disturbed many, butparticularly the Poles, Soviets and world Jewry. Despite concerns, reunification would beaccepted as a lesser threat than a chaotic East Germany.","Through the first three months of 1989, 80,00 East Germans fled their country, andmassive demonstrations raised doubts that Erich Honeker the, hard-line Communistleader could resist the democratic reforms sweeping his country. Street demonstrationsoccurred throughout East Germany in November 1989, and the East German CommunistParty was forced to admit the its system had failed.The West German constitution called for a united Germany, but it received little attentionuntil late 1989. The specter of a powerful undivided Germany troubled many, butparticularly the Soviets and Poles.Matters moved quickly in early 1990. Soviet President Gorbachev gave West Germanyan unequivocal promise that German reunification would be honored. Two days later, onthe 12th of February, said that negotiations with East Germany should begin as soon aspossible after the 18 March East German elections. In time the World War II Allieswould endorse reunification.With reunification imminent, world Jewish leaders asked for guarantees that theHolocaust would not be repeated. Most prominent American historians agreed that astable Germany was a lesser threat to stability than the woeful conditions and near chaosin East Germany.",,,,

American insurers most affected by claims from Andrew are the State Farm Group, Allstate, Hartford Insurance, Aetna, and Travellers.

Top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies took part in the festivities.","On June 22, 1990 Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was hoisted by crane onto a flatbed truck. The removal of this symbol of the Cold War was part of an elaborate ceremony attended by the top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies. Appropriate to the occasion, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze backed away from all-out opposition to united Germany's membership in NATO, suggesting that this could take place but only after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave thecountry.","On June 22, 1990 Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was hoisted by a huge crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum. The guardhouse, constructed after erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was the scene of many successful and unsuccessful attempts at escape from East Berlin and had become a symbol of the Cold War. By June of 1990 with the Berlin Wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, and with top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city after unification, U.S. officials decided it was time to remove the famous landmark. The foreign ministers attended an elaborate ceremony to honor the symbolic act. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze took the occasion to modify the previous Soviet firm opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, proposing that such a step be allowed after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. U.S. Secretary of State Baker declared himself ""underwhelmed"" by the offer, but softening of the Soviet position was a welcome sign appropriate to the occasion.",The Cold War ends as Checkpoint Charlie is lifted into history.,"As a U.S. army band played and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, Checkpoint Charlie, the symbol of the Cold War, was lifted into history today. Its removal came after East Germany overthrew its communist government and opened the border between the two Germanys.","Checkpoint Charlie was lifted into history today during a ceremony including the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies. Secretary of State Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie as a symbol of the Cold War, hoped its removal would bury the conflicts it created. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for a removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city. Checkpoint Charlie became superfluous when the East Germany overthrew its communist-controlled government and the border between East and West Germany was opened. Although the ceremony was closed to the public, residents of the street watched from their windows.","Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous symbol of the Cold War was lifted into history today. At an invitation only ceremony attended by the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies, a U.S. army band played an old Berlin song as the checkpoint was hoisted onto a waiting flatbed truck, to be taken to a museum. Speaking at the ceremony, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for the removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city and the withdrawal of troops six months after the two German states unify. Secretary of State James Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol, expressed the hope that its removal would bury the conflicts it created. The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous. Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany. Among the invited guests was West Germany's Chancellor Willy Brandt who was mayor of Berlin in the 1960s.",,,,
