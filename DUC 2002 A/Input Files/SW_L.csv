0,d116i,"Five astronaut boarded Discovery today second try sending Hubble Space Telescope orbit scan outermost reach universe clue beginning time. Astronomers are starting tingle again anticipation what Hubble will be able accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head NASA science activity. Air Force forecaster said there wa 90 percent chance weather would be favorable launching shuttle scheduled time 8:31 am. EDT. More half million gallon liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped space ship's fuel tank midnight. The astronaut, wearing bright orange flight suit, climbed crew cabin just dawn wa breaking Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomer new set eye and ear that we don't have, said William Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program. It's going change our perspective altogether. I can't say what we're going learn, I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new thing. Discovery wa aiming altitude 380 mile, highest shuttle ha ever gone, so telescope can be placed it proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, which journey space next month Astro observatory, sat launch pad 1.6 mile Discovery, only second time pad have been occupied; first wa 1986 just Challenger explosion. Hubble ha been waiting take it place space 1983, delayed technical problem and Challenger accident. The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch wa scrubbed four minute liftoff because faulty power unit shuttle. The mood Kennedy Space Center wa considerably le festive first launch attempt, when hundred astronomer gathered their family. The day launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescope space. Veteran spacewalker Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if problem develops. Discovery will follow Hubble 40 mile away two day it lens cap is opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Hubble is not expected start providing scientific data satellite month or more liftoff. However, NASA said it will release it first image open star cluster constellation Carina week launch. In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million ha been spent spare part, astronaut training and computer software operate instrument. The European Space Agency contributed $250 million 15 percent viewing time. NASA estimate it will cost $200 million year operate and maintain telescope space. During it 15-year working lifetime, telescope will provide astronomer 10 time better resolution and 25 time more sensitivity ground-based observatory. As result, they will be able study star and galaxy so distant their light ha been traveling Earth 14 billion year. Astronomers hope learn whether universe wa created 15 billion year ago believed and uncover some mystery surrounding galaxy, black hole and quasar. Hubble also is expected shed light how and when universe might end. The telescope is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered 1920s that universe is expanding. His work gave rise Big Bang theory that universe wa created tremendous explosion. In addition Hubble, Discovery carry human skull filled sensor measure space radiation that astronaut receive. It is skull's third trip space. The shuttle is end it five-day mission landing Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronaut returned Sunday second attempt launch shuttle NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery is scheduled lift 8:31 am. EDT Tuesday. We feel very confident that thing are going go well this time, said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're going come out OK Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep trying we do. That's kind name game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that countdown wa proceeding smoothly and shuttle appeared be perfect condition. The countdown got way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit forced first launch attempt be scrubbed four minute liftoff April 10. The unit wa replaced new one, which test showed be fine. Hopefully, we'll get shuttle pad this time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance favorable weather wa expected launch time, low cloud being main concern, said Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front north wa expected pas area Monday night. The outlook is considerably better Wednesday and Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronaut arrived Johnson Space Center Houston early Sunday afternoon, shuttle Columbia wa being transported launch pad 1.6 mile Discovery. It is only second time shuttle launch pad Kennedy Space Center have been occupied simultaneously. The first time wa January 1986; 16 day Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand said he doe not believe National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast his shuttle. NASA expects launch Columbia astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier May 16, one week later planned because Discovery's two-week delay. In some case, it could be problem having shuttle launch pad, Brand said. In this particular case, everything's fitting together. NASA ha Saturday get Discovery ground. After that, all launch attempt must be halted eight day so Hubble's battery can be recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen battery will power Hubble time it is disconnected Discovery's electrical system it two energy-collecting solar panel take space. Discovery's payload bay wa sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing risk contamination telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery will aim altitude 380 mile, highest shuttle ha ever gone, so telescope can be placed it proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey space, astronomer expect look back nearly beginning time and solve some universe's most perplexing mystery. Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected Hubble and thus provide additional target telescope. The $100 million observatory also will focus Columbia's nine-day mission Comet Austin, believed be it first trip solar system. Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled launch 1986, were delayed Challenger accident. The Hubble Space Telescope wa awakened it self-induced sleep today it wa still use it high-speed antenna, and it science instrument were hold, unable begin any observation. We are out `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, supervisor engineer controlling telescope. He said telescope wa running normal control-all mode, where it computer and sensor guide where it is pointing. Discovery's astronaut, meanwhile, packed their gear return Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observation Earth and talked ground-based reporter their flight. Pilot Charles Bolden said he wa especially upbeat widespread public awareness telescope, which is expected eventually look back 14 billion light year nearly birth universe. It's hard go somewhere and find someone who ha never heard Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It make little kids' eye light up. It make little kid want learn how add and subtract and study science. The telescope's big eye ha remained open, Hubble had been safe mode all motion stopped because earlier problem linking high-speed dish antenna relay satellite. The antenna are primary link relaying scientific data ground. Terry said that safe mode, one tape recorder telescope read telemetry signal all it system and that these would be played Earth and analyzed when antenna are working properly. We expect use that data investigate what happened, he said. Engineers are able send command telescope it secondary antenna communication system is not useful scientific data, which must be transmitted high rate speed. We're putting scientific instrument hold mode, effect standby mode, he said. Shortly 6 am. EDT, controller Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md., completed series command that took telescope out it safe mode and then began run 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health. It will take another day $1.5 billion telescope is operating way it wa supposed this point startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're backing very deliberate and slow and careful approach these problem, Olivier said Friday. This is not time do anything dumb. The telescope problem have put flight center several day behind, five astronaut who deployed it earlier this week were sticking their schedule. Landing is scheduled 9:48 am. EDT Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., flight controller were keeping close watch weather. Winds were predicted be 20 mph gust 29 mph. Mission rule dictate that headwind cannot exceed 29 mph touchdown. The shuttle carry enough supply stay orbit three day Sunday if necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awakened crew member 1:30 am. EDT today playing song, Cosmos. Thanks wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate today, said Commander Loren Shriver. The song wa selected honor Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronaut were finish their experiment and photography today and pack trip home. They also planned hold news conference space reporter Johnson Space Center. Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were run series test make certain shuttle's computer and control jet were ready return Earth. The crew deployed Hubble Wednesday they had stayed close telescope case there wa trouble opening aperture door. Mission specialist Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared perform space walk today crank it open orbit 380 mile Earth. But that proved unnecessary when door wa opened Friday morning, exposing telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye starlight first time. Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscope stopped working when door opened, engineer later got them back line. The gyroscope were knocked out motion and that, too, kept telescope safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director orbital verification Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's system were set conservative limit first operation and that caused many malfunction. There also were two communication outage totaling several hour. Hubble is designed safe mode so it can be master it destiny case contact orbiting communication system is lost extended period, Terry said. NASA had planned release it first test image telescope Tuesday, showing open star cluster constellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed because antenna problem. Scientific data will follow month or two. The telescope, named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomer it 15-year working lifetime look back 14 billion year and possibly determine age universe. The universe is believed have been created 15 billion year ago cosmic explosion. Hubble provided basis big-bang theory creation. He discovered 1920s that universe is expanding and that farther galaxy is Earth, faster it is moving away. After year delay and last-minute snag, Hubble Space Telescope wa freed shuttle Discovery Wednesday and, glinting sunlight, drifted orbit it 15-year search new world. Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble end shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm delay getting one telescope's solar wing unfurled. The first NASA's great observatory is now station 330 nautical mile Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really looked great we flew away it, and we sure hope it doe good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later. The $1.5 billion telescope wa released 3:38 pm. EDT shuttle entered it 20th orbit Earth, nearly two hour and one orbit later planned. The shuttle then backed away. Thank you very much ride, said Mike Harrington, director orbital verification Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialist Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been shuttle's airlock, ready walk inspace free solar panel. That proved be unnecessary. Close no cigar, better Hubble that it went way it did, Sullivan said. She and McCandless had trained nearly five year make such rescue mission. The first solar array unreeled it mast midday Wednesday shuttle passed 380 statute mile, or 330 nautical mile, South America's eastern coast. It started providing power telescope's battery, which otherwise had only eight hour charge. Deployment starboard panel, however, wa more troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latch were first released, then moved fifth it 39-foot length, and stopped again. A third attempt rolled panel out all way. Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley began long process releasing Hubble shortly 7 am. EDT when he grasped it Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted 12{-ton telescope high shuttle. Hubble wa taken shuttle electrical power just it wa lifted out cargo bay and wa operating it nickel-hydrogen battery. At one day, seven minute flight Discovery, Hubble is now it internal power, Carr said. The game ha begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking. Worries that telescope's instrument would be starved electricity eased first solar panel wa stretched out. Television camera Discovery showed first array it wa pulled it reel slowly steadily, sun reflecting gold-colored panel and silvery telescope. Discovery wa 380 statute mile Earth, 70 mile higher any shuttle ha ever flown. The orbit wa dictated need put telescope Earth's distorting atmosphere. Discovery's five astronaut were awed view. I'd pas quote day on-board astronomer something effect that big marble sure look far away today, Shriver said Hawley. Astronomers have waited seven year Hubble take it place space. The telescope originally wa scheduled launch 1983, technical problem and Challenger explosion pushed it back. The mission wa delayed another two week when faulty power unit Discovery forced National Aeronautics and Space Administration halt first launch attempt four minute April 10's scheduled liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted space, transporting Hubble out this world and search others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is be opened Friday, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Discovery wa Hubble case door doe not open properly. If problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again walk space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said telescope would be tested Thursday it ability maneuever aperture door is opened. We want be full control so we don't ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, he said. The telescope cannot focus sun because sensitivity it five instrument. If all go well, crew will land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects release it first image telescope open star cluster constellation Carina Tuesday. Data will follow month or two. Astronomers hope look back almost beginning time, studying star and galaxy so distant their light ha been traveling Earth 14 billion year. They expect determine precisely how and when universe wa formed, currently estimated 15 billion year ago. The telescope is named late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered 1920s that universe wa expanding. He also wa responsible helping form Big Bang theory creation. Ground controller Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today two main antenna $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope trying more six hour lock on. Applause erupted Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md., glitch that marred Hubble's first full day space wa solved. We have confirmation that we have achieved communication Tracking and Data Relay Satellite high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers had said all they believed antenna were working all right and that problem wa incorrectly pointing either satellite or TDRS, orbiting communication satellite that act switchboard. In successful attempt, they nearly doubled width antennas' beam take more territory, sweep 6.2 degree 10.8 degree. The telescope's low-gain antenna, which receive and transmit information much slower rate and can be used emergency, were working well. Space shuttle Discovery wa 46 mile away, available remedy certain problem. The outage wa not problem which space walker would have been summoned. The five astronaut were otherwise busy making picture storm Texas their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiment. Steve Terry, director team calibrating various aspect telescope, said first outage wa caused human error and wa not serious problem. It began 1 and 1:30 am. EDT and lasted 45 minute hour, he said. The second failure occurred 6:44 am. when controller attempted send signal telescope's two high-gain antenna TDRS. This time it wa pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, Goddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing it wa cause. The telescope, embarking 15-year search new world, wa released shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minute snag that almost sent two astronaut emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awakened crew early today loud rendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite. Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake that song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are lot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday and Hubble had good night while you were asleep. We appreciate good word everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away telescope and put shuttle series maneuver, last one completed this morning, park Discovery orbit 46 mile Hubble. The telescope really looked great we flew away it, and we sure hope it doe good work, Shriver said Wednesday. Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks all great work you've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud you. Scientists have hailed Hubble NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft greatest advance astronomy Galileo raised small telescope his eye nearly 400 year ago. Discovery and it five astronaut will follow telescope while controller Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such responding directional command. The next milestone is Friday, when telescope's 10-foot aperture door is be opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Then Tuesday, NASA expects release first image telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina. Data will follow month or two. If aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return telescope so two astronaut could perform spacewalk fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said telescope would be tested today it ability maneuver aperture door is opened. We want be full control so we don't ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, he said. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitive instrument. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used shuttle's 50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope and hoist it cargo bay. One telescope's solar array unreeled it mast expected and started providing power telescope's battery, which otherwise had only eight hour charge. But there wa trouble second panel. It wouldn't budge when latch were released, and then moved fifth it 39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all way out third attempt. By final attempt, astronaut Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were their space suit airlock, 30 minute away taking tool hand and going outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik said cause problem is unknown. The 8{-hour procedure wa performed 380 mile Earth, 70 mile higher any shuttle ha ever flown. The orbit wa dictated need put Hubble Earth's distorting atmosphere. Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost beginning time, studying star and galaxy so distant their light ha taken 14 billion year reach Earth. They hope determine how and when universe wa formed, currently estimated 15 billion year ago. The telescope originally wa scheduled launch 1983 wa delayed technical problem and Challenger accident. Discovery, which blasted orbit Tuesday, is scheduled land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven year late, Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out this world and search so distant that they may have been formed beginning time. Less five hour it rode space shuttle Discovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope sent it first test radio signal. At sign life, applause and cheer erupted Mission Control Houston. As we can tell, everything look perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesday will be drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space. Discovery, trailing arc white smoke brilliant blue sky, carried silver-colored telescope orbit 380 mile Earth higher 70 mile any previous shuttle. There Hubble will stay search yet-unseen wonder creation instrument that can look 14 billion year backward time. Our window universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted Discovery rose it seaside launch pad. It's beautiful day have Hubble Space Telescope orbit instead here Earth it's been so many year, said NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's it element and I'm delighted. The telescope wa supposed be launched 1983, technical problem and Challenger accident delayed it deployment. It suffered further delay two week ago when countdown wa stopped four-minutes-to-go point because faulty hydraulic unit shuttle. While it remained Earth, telescope cost $7 million month exercise and keep readiness. In it first day space, that checkout and testing continued remotely control Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland. On hand watch Discovery launching wa contingent scientist who have hailed Hubble greatest advance astronomy Galileo raised small telescope his eye nearly 400 year ago. Truly referred early-day astronomer when he wa asked long delay getting telescope it working station. Somebody other day said, `Who remembers day that Galileo picked his telescope look stars?' said Truly, former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matter that we do it right. The telescope is 43 foot long and 14 foot diameter, size railroad tank car. When it fly free, it will receive electrical power it six scientific instrument two wing-like solar array that extend outward each side. It is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that universe wa expanding and that farther away galaxy is, faster it is traveling. That gave support theory that massive explosion Big Bang created universe 10 20 billion year ago. The Hubble is expected help provide answer two major questions: How old is universe? How big is it? The telescope ha two mirror, one 94.5 inch diameter, other 12 inch. Two instrument are camera, two are spectrometer and one is photometer. In addition, fine pointing system act sixth instrument providing precise measurement distance. On Wednesday, Hawley is grapple 12{-ton telescope shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out cargo bay, point it, and long checkout drop it overboard orbit it own. In cargo bay, telescope receives electrical power shuttle. But juice is cut when instrument is lifted out and it will depend internal battery solar panel are extended receive light sun. Should solar panel not deploy, mission specialist Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed space suit, ready go open cargo bay unfurl array manually. Discovery's launch wa not it problem. With 31 second left countdown, computer that run final moment liftoff refused close fuel valve and stopped launch process. The problem wa overcome and shuttle lifted 8:34 am. EDT, three minute late. The shuttle is scheduled land Sunday 9:49 am. EDT Edwards Air Force Base California. On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, shuttle's windshield wa splattered several fleck thing. He said windshield wa streaked debris and that it also wa smeared when spent booster rocket fell climb orbit. The astronaut also had problem their UHF radio circuit, and one ship's small rear thruster wa inoperative. Neither problem wa considered serious. The shuttle that put Hubble Space Telescope orbit also carry instrument used 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble: eyepiece what once wa world's most powerful telescope. It's great pleasure have something such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contribution astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday she circled Earth space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope wa carried orbit Sullivan. After she brings eyepiece back Earth, it will be placed display observatory. It's basically symbolic gesture astronomy future astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group run observatory, located San Gabriel Mountains Los Angeles. The discovery made Hubble 100-inch telescope Mount Wilson gave u giant leap forward our understanding universe, McAfee said. We believe Hubble Space Telescope will do same thing. The Hooker Telescope wa world's most powerful telescope it construction 1918 1948, when 200-inch Hale Telescope wa placed operation Mount Palomar Observatory northeast San Diego. Using Hooker Telescope, Hubble wa first determine distance galaxy Milky Way, institute said statement. This crucial discovery provided first definite proof that other galaxy existed far confines our local galaxy, institute said. During 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and assistant used Hooker telescope take thousand photograph faint galaxy, showing that most them were moving away each other very quickly. This provided observational evidence concept, suggested Einstein's Theory Relativity, that universe is expanding, institute said. Hubble's work helped convince scientist universe wa created giant explosion, called big bang, estimated 15 billion year ago. The Hooker Telescope wa mothballed 1985 Carnegie Institution, former operator observatory, money-saving move. The institute hope obtain fund reopen it.

Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.

1,d113h,"INDIA suffered fresh wave terror last night when explosion destroyed two block flat centre city Calcutta, killing least 45 people and injuring score others. Police said bomb exploded crowded trade and residential district Bowbazaar shortly midnight, causing two block flat collapse and trapping 70 people rubble. The identity bomber wa unknown explosion come just five day 250 people were killed and least 1,200 injured series bomb attack aimed heart Indian business capital Bombay. A militant Sikh group fighting independence Indian state Punjab ha claimed responsibility Bombay blast, police are unconvinced, saying they were carried out foreign group connivance 'local criminals'. In what many interpreted reference Pakistan, whom India ha fought three war, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, federal home (interior) minister, told parliament New Delhi that he suspected 'an international conspiracy.' Most estimated 125 people living Calcutta flat were their bed when blast occurred, setting fire building, according official city's central control room. At least 45 people were dead arrival hospital, they said. Last Friday series car bomb exploded Bombay what government described systematic attack India's commercial heart. Among target were Bombay Stock Exchange, landmark Air India building, shopping complex, and two hotel airport. The attack Calcutta and Bombay are severe setback attempt heal wound created recent intercommunal violence, which ha caused deep shock throughout India. More 2,000 people died riot, including 700 Bombay, razing mosque Ayodhya northern India Hindu zealot December 6. Some fear wave bomb attack is designed stir renewal communal strife and undermine effort government Mr P V Narasimha Rao open economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. Last night national and local state leader appealed calm attempt prevent renewed outbreak violence. Mr Rao urged nation ignore rumour 'inhuman and criminal blast'. A ROW ha erupted Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and Securities and Exchange Board India, security watchdog, board's recent first-ever inspection stockbrokers' book. The Sebi ha accused stockbroker flouting exchange's rule, including regulation margin trading designed limit risk member defaulting excessive speculative investment. It ha also accused exchange authority failing enforce rule and poor administration. The stock exchange denied allegation, saying they were 'baseless, made out context and blown out proportion.' The argument will do nothing restore investors' faith stock market where, measured Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, share have fallen 48 cent their peak early last year, including 320 point fall government's budget wa announced two week ago. Yesterday index closed 2330. Foreign investor, who are being wooed India source much-needed capital, will also be concerned latest allegation poor management exchange. In one it most damaging passage, inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas, leading firm headed Mr Hemendra Kothari, former BSE president, and Mr Jaswant Chotalal, member BSE's governing body, avoided margin payment totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 408m). Mr Kothari said yesterday that most transaction covered report were off-exchange deal directly financial institution which margin payment were not required. Mr M R Mayya, BSE's executive director, said BSE rule permitted such bilateral off-exchange transaction. Sebi also accused exchange mismanaging administration it building. This week's argument is only latest series dispute which began almost soon Sebi started operation year ago. It wa established Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, crucial element financial reform. Brokers claim Sebi is heavy-handed and fails understand their need. They say rule must be applied flexibly and many firm are extremely small and unable carry cost extra regulation. But finance minister is backing Sebi hilt and singled it out praise his recent budget speech. Finance ministry official believe loose regulation allow broker and dodge tax and also contributed last year's security market scandal which bank, including UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost combined gross total Rs40bn. The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home Bombay Stock Exchange, wa rocked two powerful bomb last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured. The market reopened Monday attempt return normal. It ha had compromise - trading ha been restricted hour day, and dealing ha moved back traditional ring, where it stopped year ago. Dealers seemed this, BSE index rising 5.6 cent Monday and Tuesday. But another bomb blast Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday, and index came back 50.62, or 2.1 cent, 2,40923. All this ha taken place volatile background: Bombay equity market, six week or so, ha had contend first unusually bullish speculation, national budget February 27, and subsequently some savage expression disappointment. Dr Manmohan Singh, Indian finance minister, disappointed trader budget end last month. He postponed corporate tax reform year, denying hope tax cut recommended expert group. He reduce excise and import duty broad front, left out cement and steel sector, where share price had been boosted pre-budget speculation. To top it all, Dr Singh refused equate domestic investor their overseas counterpart taxing short-term capital gain. He lowered tax 30 cent 65 cent expatriate Indians and foreign investor local investor it remained 44.5 cent. Taking tax concession granted, trader had driven share price February make kill later. Instead, budget turned out be nightmare.

THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troop Bombay last night more dozen bomb exploded city, killing 200 people and injuring more thousand. The device, mostly car bomb, appeared be systematic attack India's commercial heart. All exploded 90 minute afternoon. Among target were Bombay Stock Exchange, landmark Air India building, shopping complex, and two hotel airport.

The bomb appeared designed stir renewal communal strife and undermine effort government Mr PV Narasimha Rao open economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. One target wa close headquarters Shiv Sena, Hindu nationalist party accused fomenting violence riot, which most victim were Moslems. National and local state leader appealed calm attempt prevent renewed outbreak violence. Mr Rao urged nation ignore rumour 'inhuman and criminal bomb blasts'. Mr Sharad Pawar, former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister Maharashtra state, said all road Bombay had been blocked and army put alert. He said: 'It is aimed disrupting economy and it appears conscious effort because only Bombay seems be target.' Mr Shankarrao Chavan, federal home (interior) minister, told parliament New Delhi: 'We suspect international conspiracy.' The Indian High Commission London said attack were 'part externally supported terrorism which ha targeted India some time'. However, Indian official stopped short directly accusing Pakistan, country's arch-enemy. The bomb attack were spread throughout city and were clearly aimed city's better-off business people - contrast riot which victim were mainly poor. At 28-storey stock exchange building, 3,000 people were second-storey trading floor when bomb exploded underground car park, hurling shard glass floor and street.

'I'm lucky be alive,' he said his hospital bed. 'Who this? Who can stop this happening again?' Across Bombay people were asking themselves same question this weekend. They sensed there wa enormous difference riot which scarred city December and again January. Those were caused traditional mix crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatred stirred destruction mosque Ayodhya. The weapon used were mostly primitive - knife, club and petrol bottle. Friday's outrage, contrast, bear deadly stamp high-technology terrorism, complete Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timer, efficient organisation and money. The only comparable previous incident wa assassination 1991 Mr Rajiv Gandhi, former prime minister, Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorist. But that wa single bomb aimed one man - explosion Bombay were designed terrorise nation's commercial capital. Bombay account 35 cent India's export. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, described blast attack India's economy. The immediate assumption highest level and street Bombay wa that those responsible must have been foreigner or had foreign help. But these suggestion were seen Bombay deliberate attempt deflect attention people who popular mind are real suspect - Moslem extremist who might have taken revenge riot which hit India Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 Bombay. If Moslems are found have staged attack, Indian authority will certainly suspect that operation wa supported Moslem country, notably Pakistan. The implication would be vast. Breaking diplomatic relation would be minimum step Delhi could take dangerous road. Mr Rao chose his word carefully his visit Bombay: 'There is definite possibility that our search may not stop country. I do not want name anybody because it will have ramification and country.' There is no evidence linking attack Moslem extremist, let alone Pakistan. Even if Moslem group are found be responsible bombing, they could have been supplied other Moslem country. India would still face diplomatic crisis hardly same scale. For moment, such concern seem remote street Bombay, where atmosphere yesterday wa calm. Workmen were clearing away rubble blast site, including blackened stock exchange building. Bombayites seemed determined put outrage them. At Gymkhana Club and dozen other sport ground, hundred men and boy were playing cricket they do every Sunday. Others were walking seafront arch Gateway India. The stock exchange authority plan re-start trading soon they can -probably today - using old trading floor exchange vacated only last year. Businessmen estimated main loss city would be loss life and injury and damage caused blasted building. They not expect same widespread disruption production occurred riot.

2,d120i,"THE revelation that John Major is capable candid, blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record friendly journalist ha surprised some people. It ha been suggested that recording prime minister's conversation Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, which Major used variety four-, six- and eight-letter word communicate his lack fondness certain colleague, may do him good. With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction. What piffle. Major is gonner, especially this week's revolt wooden-tops Christchurch by-election, where Conservative majority 23,015 last year's general election wa converted 16,427 majority Liberal Democrats. Fifteen month too late, voter Christchurch rounded Tories malignant and squeaky fury. In reality, all politician, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting private when speaking public. In public, they have be careful what they say, so their utterance achieve horrible mattness. But private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their word become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really is spectacle. To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday John Major and John Smith. Smith, Scot, is leader Labour Party, though not many people know that. In aftermath Christchurch, where Labour lost it deposit, I wanted provoke two Johns spot real soul-searching. To guarantee them privacy, I used signal-scrambler. No one could have eavesdropped. Their response were true form. But I have left out swear-words because new Financial Times Style Guide state that 'the gratuitous use expletive or obscenity is discouraged . . . Four-letter expletive will be confined infrequent use review (Arts) pages.' I can live that, though why artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is puzzle. First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, just one article, FT this week? They were describing Europe's lunatic monetary policy and exchange rate arrangement. They not pull their punch. I bet you went chalk-white. 'So why not walk plank, John? You are most unpopular prime minister start fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly or not, you are drawing blame all life's unpleasantness, let alone cock-ups.' 'Are you sure?' prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . how it come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load . . . let me put it you - economy, course . . . I mean, wimpy guy me. But I'm not giving that, . . .' On and it went. Then I rang John Smith. I told him I had been impressed his interview Andrew Marr The Independent Thursday, which he sharpened his promise introduce meaty political reform (if he ever get elected), including referendum proportional representation. I said: 'You are starting raise your game, John. Many people will have agreed your assertion that democracy Britain is decaying, and that Tories must be roasted their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practice - especially their 'centralisation power and elimination opposition'. But some your critic still accuse you, John, laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say that?' 'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense life, behint kist lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig wa Rab M'Graen, clever, sturdy fellow, then he wa sae fley'd his showther gae keek, an' tumbl'd wi' wintle. Likewise political and constitutional reform, Michael, L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, lang's I dow]' After that, I thought telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader Liberal Democrats, solicit his view Christchurch. But I couldn't raise energy. Last year biography Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that Majors' favourite film wa Being There. I entirely concur their choice. In case you not see that marvellous film, this, essence, wa plot: man no one know anything about, gardener called Chauncey, rise trace become, end film, serious candidate US presidency. Chauncey, played Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiment halting monotone this convinces Republican party's power broker that he is sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromide everyone seems hear what they want believe. He ha deadly innocence. No wonder Majors liked this film. John Major must, some level, have appreciated similarity his own, strangely intangible, rise and that Chauncey's. If he not see similarity, that is still more revealing. Do not protest that urban John Major could not identify gardener. In interview Farmers Weekly, few day ago, Major disclosed unknown fact: his father wa once farmer. Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy agriculture'. (Well, it wa obvious Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father wa farmer. He lived small farm somewhere Shropshire.' Francis Wheen The Guardian, keen student Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed Bromsgrove 1910. As Wheen pointed out, Major wa unresponsive 33 year old that time, and - minor point this - Bromsgrove is not Shropshire. This, course, doe not mean that Major made everything up. Family folklore is peculiar thing. Yet when I heard this, my mind immediately went back incident few month ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre US steel industry, part his American tour. I recall that he made great hit recounting that his father had been steelworker city. A farmer Farmers Weekly, Pittsburgh steelworker American audience . . . pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore extension John Major himself, can be all thing all people. If John Major were different sort politician, this would be point barely worth making. But it doe seem all piece Major's approach wider political issue. On one hand he will appeal pro-Europeans his party claiming want Britain be heart Europe. On other he is free insulting reference European Commission, whenever it is necessary appeal audience Euro-sceptics. There are those who will argue that this merely mean that Major is typical democratic politician, that one who want become prime minister democracy must recognise many constituency interest, not just one. But that ha not been true Major's most recent Conservative predecessor. Margaret Thatcher wa notoriously dogmatic, public, and so too wa Edward Heath, though he always pretended be 'consensus politician'. No, Major's technique is very much his invention, very much reflection his particular character, itself product his unsettled family background. His father, Tom Major-Ball, wa itinerant figure, moving place place, trying his hand any number occupation, including circus. No wonder young John Major learned skill fitting prevailing circumstance, no matter how fluctuating. The only problem is old one: you cannot fool all people all time. Except movie. Dominic Lawson is editor The Spectator ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone himself winning general election. His honeymoon, very personal victory, wa short-lived and now he begin second year his hard-won term deeply unpopular leader who ha everything still prove. The 12 month have been hijacked internal party difference Europe, debacle surrounding UK withdrawal exchange rate mechanism European Monetary System, and continuing, deep recession which ha disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory supporter business. Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday outbreak political point-scoring government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader Commons, conceded: 'No one pretend that last year ha been easy,' he also claimed that much had been achieved. The government's effort secure framework long-term prosperity wa beginning pay off. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, wa joined 10 frontbench colleague launching counter-attack, involving detailed and documented indictment Mr Major's failure. He attacked Tories building 'a bonfire pre-election commitments'. Tory allegiance business world have also been put immense pressure, though criticism policy drift and inaction may soften recession end. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president Confederation British Industry, remained cautious volunteered: 'If I were betting man I would say we have embryo recovery.' Mr Major can take little comfort conclusion, widespread industrialist, that his greatest achievement year ha been Britain's withdrawal ERM - something which he resisted and which, end, he had no control. Most industrialist, however, find it hard criticise Mr Major individual, many drawing flattering parallel his personal quality and those his predecessor. He still attracts gratitude election victory, which wa seen - subsequent problem economy - best result business. But, previous No 10 occupant, he is seen weak leader, little vision and bereft clearly articulated political conviction. There is general perception that, important though Britain's future place Europe is, prime minister ha been excessively preoccupied community affair and associated internal party ruction, detriment domestic economy. Many industrialist are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting reshape economic strategy favour manufacturing base. But jury is out whether rhetoric will give way effective action. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The first 12 month - election victory initial Maastricht defeat ----------------------------------------------------------------------- APRIL Wins election 21 seat majority 'The country looked Labour government eye and decided that it wa not all Time Change' - Peter Jenkins, late political commentator 'We have won tonight magnificent victory, victory many people thought our grasp' - Major ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAY Best Conservative local election result 13 year England and Wales.

Out are eminence gris Victorian letter - novel Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make grade. This week shortlist hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced six judge, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. They have avoided dull and worthy classic and chosen six book which stirred fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In Year Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide. The winner will be revealed October 15 (four day 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) Cheltenham Festival Literature. Like today's Booker Prize, it is publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is backing spoof award, is significant publisher classic Victorian novel. But retrospective Booker is also fascinating exercise historical reconstruction. It raise question how relationship literature and society ha changed 100 year. First, similarity. A good yarn is good yarn. Of 1894 book, Trilby is tale tone-deaf model who sings angel when mesmerised sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croak crow when he dy one her concert. The Prisoner Zenda tell Englishman impersonating King Ruritania and rescuing him demon. On 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge Angels re-enacts wolf-child legend. All book list are gripping story. The list share key theme. Both, instance, have book colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which is set First World War German East Africa. Both provoke similar way. The controversial book 1894 were Trilby, it louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, which 17-year-old girl is seduced, impregnated and offered service professional baby killer fiver. It is now seen Moore's best work, 1894 it had problem finding publisher and powerful circulating library refused take it. A century on, relationship fiction and sexual morality remains vexed. Last week, Times critic complained inclusion Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel homosexual love, The Folding Star, Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethic. But if Hollinghurst win Booker, his novel will not become succes de scandale Esther Waters and Trilby, which became bestselling novel 19th century. For great difference then and now is that 1894 Booker Prize wa not needed sell fiction. Today, we accept gap literary writing, such Hollinghurst's, and popular bestseller writer Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland. This is gap Booker try bridge giving high-level publicity work which would not normally reach mass audience. The trick work - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback copy. Before short-list wa announced it sold 10,600. The Victorians, contrast, were lover contemporary fiction. Novels accounted 20 cent published book, and no distinction wa made high and low art. In mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 Little Dorrit, equivalent nearly Pounds 400,000 today. Between 1861 and 1894, when population UK wa half that today and literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copy. All 1894 Booker writer were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writer whose book can be reread pleasure 100 year later. Why wa fiction so much closer public heart 1894? Social, cultural and psychological reason play part. Socially, 1890s reading public wa vastly more homogenous group today: small number middle class author wrote middle class audience time when be literate wa belong elite. The idea two-tier, and down-market, fiction wa irrelevant. Culturally, these writer and reader were certain their place mainstream, and novel wa their political and intellectual forum. Today we no longer share Victorian confidence novel key genre our age. Modernism and overturning traditional form Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief novel and encouraged divergence highbrow and lowbrow. The dominance film and television ha made novel more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract most creative talent. George du Maurier originally offered outline Trilby Henry James, who he thought would write better novel. Today du Maurier would have sold it Hollywood or BBC. The fantasy element fiction, which we identify character if we know them, wa answered 19th century novel; 20th century we have TV soap. Just tabloid newspaper feature character EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop wa running serial there wa widespread press speculation whether Little Nell would die, and reader wrote begging her be saved. Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soap were clear feature novel 1894. Both In Year Jubilee and Esther Waters, example, centre burning 1890s debate marriage, feminism and 'New Woman', are also tearjerker which everyone enjoyed. The 1894 book are compelling because they prefigure our time and are set back them. Trilby is tale hypnotism and unconscious decade away Freud; The Ebb Tide paved way Conrad's Heart Darkness and first questioning colonial oppression. It is unlikely that 1994 Booker choice will speak eloquently new trend today. Whereas 1894 title had contemporary setting, many 1994 book are historical (such Paradise) or are driven nostalgia (such Beside Ocean Time). Which book will win October 15? Stevenson will get sympathy vote because he died 1894 Samoa, setting The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book will get retrospective vote, because it is best-known today and ha fashionable mythic overtone lost paradise Mowgli's jungle; it position list may also rescue it schmaltzy Disney association and confirm it serious novel young man's self-discovery. My vote go Trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - it anti-Semitic portrait Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is story demonic possession and haunt imagination fairy tale long better-written work have faded memory. Like Rebecca, popular novel du Maurier's granddaughter, it is natural equivalent what current Booker Prize seek create: combination classic and bestseller. The shortlist six Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted question 'Who?' many publishing industry. According one insider, some list 'are B-team writer best'. The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published Chatto and Windus), melancholy study homosexual obsession which wa tipped likely candidate initial 'long list' 15, The Reef (Granta) young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which wa almost universally well-reviewed. As other three - Knowledge Angels (Green Bay) philosophical fable children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside Ocean Time (John Murray) 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make grade'. The shortlist Booker, UK's most hyped literary prize and one most lucrative, is all more surprising bumper year new fiction fulfilling criterion - English language and non-American - consideration award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems astonishing omission, do new novel Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace. But if shortlist final six candidate prize may be disappointing, traditional controversy surrounding award is rife ever. One unsurprising omission final selection wa When The World Was Steady, first novel Claire Messud, which wa 'long list' it wa pointed out that author wa wife James Wood, chief literary reviewer The Guardian newspaper and Booker judge. Professor John Bayley, chairman Booker panel and husband former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise Mr Wood's failure reveal his relationship Ms Messud. But it is final list, rather controversy, that discredit award according some critic. 'This list,' said one man letter, 'must have dealt final death blow Booker.' The winner, selected original 130, will be announced October 11.

Greek diver have plunged 162 foot Aegean Sea and back history, finding treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk Greek revolutionary 1822. The remains wooden sailing ship were found island Chios eastern Aegean point where historical account place sinking Ottoman ship, according Peter Nicolaides, diver and salvage expert. The Bourloti Seimaz or Explosives Invincible wa set afire and sunk Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris revenge Turkish killing and looting Chios. Thousands islander died Turkish raid, which shocked other nation and swung Western European country Greek struggle independence Ottoman Empire. Greece won independence 1830. The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced famous picture, The Massacre Chios, based raid. It's incredible discovery, straight out history book we used read school War Independence, Nicolaides said interview Friday The Associated Press. Nicolaides, who heard wreck while teaching underwater archaeology course local diver last winter, started querying fisherman where their net snagged seabed obstacle. He pinpointed wreck May 3, he said. When I dived, I found ships' timber sticking out muddy seabed and dozen object Islamic cooking pot, cannon ball, candlestick, chalice Greek Orthodox church, he said. The ship wa obviously crammed loot Chios. I think there may be gold and silver item well, he said. I also saw what I recognized human bone, he added. He said wreckage indicated vessel wa least 100 foot length. According historian, more 1,000 people including 400 Greek captive were ship when Kanaris staged his attack early hour June 7, 1822. The Greek admiral sailed nearby island Psara, towing boat stuffed explosive. Its pointed bow wa rammed mouth cannon Bourloti Seimaz and fuse lit. The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, wa killed blast that split ship. Kanaris and his crew Greeks escaped. This is very significant, very emotive find, coming this particular period history, said George Papathanassopoulos, Culture Ministry's adviser marine archaeology. Papathanassopoulos said 162-foot water depth site will make investigation difficult underwater archaeology rarely is attempted depth 113 foot, he said, This is ship that must be explored. Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible tap American and Turkish expertise excavate wreck international project. American expert Institute Nautical Archaeology Texas A & M University, working cooperation Turkish diver, have pioneered underwater excavation Turkish Aegean coast. Greek marine archaeologist focus locating and surveying historic wreck scattered Aegean and rarely carry out excavation. Ferries are safest vessel afloat. But, tragic sinking Estonia loss more 800 life demonstrates, when they do go toll human life can be high. As ferry increase size, so number board risk mechanical failure or crew error go up. The move roll-on roll-off ferry vehicle deck which run entire length vessel ha increased risk that, once sea penetrates hold bow door or gash ship's side, it can lead vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and it member, ship-owning nation, have devoted much thought two decade ship safety. But sinking Estonia should lead new review ferry safety. Particularly worrying are eyewitness report which suggest that water penetrated bow door manner reminiscent sinking Herald Free Enterprise 1987. Unlike Herald, Estonia appears have had it door closed, ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable water penetration. Any review ferry safety should focus three main issue. First subject ferry design should be reconsidered. Additional stability could be provided addition sponsons, stabilising bulge which project ship's side just water line. Greater resistance influx water could be obtained installing moveable barrier or bulkhead break large car deck. These proposal were looked British government wake sinking Herald Free Enterprise. It calculated that it would cost Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m improve standard 57 vessel UK ferry fleet, further Pounds 22m extra annual running cost. Higher cost would inevitably lead higher fare - unwelcome ferry operator when, short cross-Channel route, they face competition Channel tunnel. But difficulty pushing fare rise would be nothing damaging ferry company another disaster. Second, IMO and national government must look closely how improve enforcement existing regulation. The IMO ha been trying move enforcement it agenda, it depends good will and professionalism government and shipowner. Third, IMO should be given support national government it campaign, launched yesterday, improve crew training. Much regulation recent year ha concentrated improving ship and it equipment. Above all, if new regulation doe turn out be necessary, it must be introduced speedily. As thing stand, it can take year change are ratified enough government give them force. The European Union, which Sweden and Finland are getting ready join, could take lead speeding process. Ship safety is not, course, just issue ferry sector. Five (small) ferry were lost last year, according Lloyd's Register. But this figure pale insignificance compared 96 general cargo ship and 12 tanker which also went down. When cargo vessel third-world crew go distant ocean, very little attention is paid. If loss relatively modern passenger vessel European water can make shipping safety higher priority government and public, this will be some small compensation loss life Estonia.

President Bush said case wa closed and accepted Democratic assurance future cooperation. That doesn't undo resentment some Tower's more ardent Republican ally Senate and some corner White House. Bush lieutenant claimed they had heard what sounded assurance support dozen Senate Democrats. They ended only three Democrats close-to-party-line vote Tower. Nevertheless, week former Texas senator wa denied confirmation secretary defens, water have closed. There will be ripple, and some them could be wave-sized. The good-behavior rule set debate Tower's drinking habit and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain be invoked precedent whenever Republicans spot Democratic target. We've established what will be known Tower standard, said Sen. John Warner, R-Va. That argument will be used House Republicans challenging financial conduct House Speaker Jim Wright. But it will be debating point, not turning point, Wright controversy that wa ordained long Tower episode. While President Bush wa unwavering his support Tower, he burned no bridge congressional Democrats. He insisted that Tower wa best man job and he spoke out repeatedly his choice, it wa clear that nomination wa doomed. But he didn't get nasty it, saying there wa no point escalating fight. That's over, he said 24 hour Tower defeat. That's history. And now we are going go forward. The 53-47 vote Tower wa setback Bush sense that it always is defeat when Congress denies president something he want. But this denial not cost Bush program, or major campaign pledge, or support voter. Indeed, it could turn out that Senate president favor sending Tower back Texas instead Pentagon. It wa break Bush could not make political ally who had been Pentagon job Ronald Reagan wa elected president. Tower had not been Reagan man he had supported Bush 1980 nomination. And Reagan White House went some length rule senator out job he sought, declaring that new president would not be nominating any Senate Republican any Cabinet post. After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his loyalty, all way losing vote when standard, somewhat safer course would have been withdraw nominee. Tower not only shunned withdrawal; he offered condition that had be humiliating, if only Senate would let him have job. Tower promised quit drinking, taking pledge national television. And when that didn't work, he offered become first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans proposed that he get job six-month trial and then return reconfirmation, gimmick that would have changed system and could have haunted presidency. No deal. So Tower became ninth Cabinet nominee ever be rejected, first who wa former senator. Bush said he had been fighting right president appoint his Cabinet, he avoided language that would have raised political stake. Tower not restrain himself. Battling job, he said withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be damning president's judgment. He said his nomination had been turned vehicle major presidential defeat. Tower's advocate Senate floor said grave constitutional issue were stake, that authority presidency wa line, that Senate will come rue rule it wrote Tower decision. But Bush said all that outcome, either way, would not hurt other issue. Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman Armed Services Committee and pivotal figure Tower defeat, agreed.

Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued terse statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower refused comment published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leader that Tower used drink bottle scotch sitting. An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement Tower's drinking habit 1970s came Sen. Sam Nunn, committee chairman, ton brick and wa factor Nunn's opposition nomination. The newspaper reported that Combest later gave different story FBI, saying that Tower and group friend not Tower alone had frequently consumed bottle scotch. After meeting staff and adviser, Combest, who worked then-Sen. Tower 1970s, issued two-sentence statement supporting his fellow Texan. As member Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence senator and his ability lead this country's armed force. In my judgment, John Tower will be superb secretary defense, statement said. Combest spokesman Rich Adams refused comment further, and said Combest wa not available speak reporter. The Washington Post reported that Combest described Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner Virginia, ranking Republican committee, Tower's heavy drinking bout 1970s. A congressional source wa quoted saying that Combest told senator that Tower would drink much full bottle scotch two or three time week. Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, told Post that Combest originally went Nunn and Warner tell them Tower had ended his previous excessive abuse alcohol. Boyd also told Post that group people drank entire bottle scotch, not Tower alone. That wa account Combest gave FBI his talk Nunn and Warner, newspaper said. It said that that account, Combest said that he had only seen Tower drunk two or three occasion. Tower ha acknowledged that he drank excessively 1970s, say he ha reduced his intake wine dinner. On Sunday, he promised not drink drop alcohol if confirmed defense secretary. Combest, 43, worked Tower seven year, 1971-1978, legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy. Tower served Senate 24 year, deciding not seek re-election 1984. He wa chairman Senate Armed Services Committee 1981 1984. The committee, now controlled Democrats, voted 11-9 party line last Thursday recommend full Senate reject Tower's nomination. You would obviously expect Mr. Tower say no, and he obliges: volubly and passionately. If that wa all there wa ""Consequences,"" we could scan dust jacket and invest our saving local real estate. ""Consequences"" read bit political Stephen King story small senator swelled Beltway monster. Politics never ha been squeamish, Tower controversy leaf much more disagreeable taste senator's caperings (which mostly took place '70s anyway). Were writing le stiff and narrative technique le choppy, ""Consequences"" might have been classic case study late 20th-century politics out control. Given Mr. Tower's qualification job -- intelligence, patriotism and chairmanship Armed Services Committee -- nomination should have sailed flying color. Instead it sank Bismarck. Clearly and apparently his surprise, Mr. Tower had made many enemy his arrival Washington 1961, rubbing supporter wrong way. The senator Lone Star State could be lordly, his English-cut suit. Once, meeting editor my newspaper which had backed him strongly, he thought nothing tilting back his chair, crossing his tiny, well-shod foot atop conference table. When Tower hearing opened, all manner accusation came public notice. The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claimed have seen senator consorting A Lady Not His Wife. It wa reported that Mr. Tower had chased secretary his desk and had fondled woman Bergstrom Air Force Base. The second wife, whom senator had recently divorced, possessed repertory tale she cheerfully volunteered. At his hotel, Mr. Tower wa accorded that doubtful tribute instant-celebrity status, medium stakeout. The nominee issued fervent denials: He drank only wine, having long sworn scotch; he'd never chased secretaries; his service defense-industry client had been proper and modest. None charge, least Mr. Tower's showing, proved have least substance. No use. Dirt is dirtier purity is pure, one John O'Hara's character observes. Sen. Sam Nunn, Mr. Tower's successor Armed Services Committee chairman, seemed initially smile nomination; then rumor mill started churning and he changed front. While endeavoring look statesmanlike, Sen. Nunn leaned moderate Democrats who would otherwise have supported Tower. Sen. Nunn made campaign personal, say Mr. Tower -- vote me or vote him. Most Democrats, end, went Sen. Nunn. What wa all this about? Morality? Mr. Tower suggests instead that Sen. Nunn, presidential hopeful, discovered and seized opportunity show who wa really No. 1 national defense. Sen. Nunn had every reason know that moral and ethical charge leveled Mr. Tower, and investigated exhaustively FBI, were flimsy. Yet he waved them anyway. When medium retailed lurid and unsubstantiated story, Sen. Nunn pursed his lip Georgia Sunday-school superintendent and suggested that drunken Mr. Tower might accidentally press nuclear button. ""Sam Nunn,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""used FBI inquiry discredit me and strike president United States. The essential chain good judgment and goodwill broke my confirmation process."" Sen. Nunn ha company Mr. Tower's dishonor roll. There is Sen. Ernest Hollings (""a study arrogance and pomposity""), Sen. James Exon (""one most excessive regular boozer Senate"") and NBC's Andrea Mitchell (""the most viciously partisan reporter I've ever seen""), Washington press corp. Sen. John Warner, Republican, is depicted falling all himself stay good Sen. Nunn. Mr. Tower feel, not reason, that he wa arraigned moral charge cynical colleague and medium personage whom no one ever mistook Southern Baptist deacon. ""I don't so much resent my rejection Senate,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""as way it wa done."" ""Tower, you were lynched,"" Mike Wallace, CBS correspondent, told him. Worse yet, lynch mob remains large. --- Mr. Murchison is senior columnist Dallas Morning News. The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected nomination former Texas Sen. John Tower defense secretary, delivering major rebuke President Bush just 49 day his term. The Senate's 53-47 vote came bitter and divisive debate focused Tower's drinking habit, behavior woman and his business dealing defense contractor.

John Warner Virginia, senior GOP member Senate Armed Services Committee. His head is high, his voice is strong, Warner said. He asked me convey thanks his word troop who rallied his support.

Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said he would support nomination. Senators party credited Tower's defeat decision oppose him made Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman Armed Services Committee. When he made his decision all other Democrats wheeled him, said Sen. John Chafee, R-RI. With prospect defeat seemingly inevitable, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, If necessary, we'll come (new) candidate very rapidly. Names most frequently mentioned White House speculation replacement Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, former secretary Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. Scowcroft replied No when asked this morning if he wa line Pentagon job. It must be clear all that people chief staff and national security adviser, any number congressman and senator and any number other expert have candidate tip their tongue, Fitzwater said. But time ha not come, he added. The time will come soon vote is completed. We will wait then. The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and one Republican committed vote Tower or leaning strongly that direction. It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats declared Tower or leaning his way. Nevertheless, White House said it wanted see nomination go all way vote. Tower, meanwhile, reported work Pentagon where he and his three daughter had coffee together. He then continued review various administration proposal. I hope and believe we can work together important matter, Mitchell said. The tension this issue will have no long-lasting effect relationship. I want say bottom my heart that I hope this will be case. The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed wa dealt crushing blow Wednesday parade previously undecided Democratic senator announced they would vote no. Only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen Texas said he would vote yes, joining just two other Democrats who have made that decision. Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J.

Gorbachev Friday proposed tougher legislation punish Soviets who seek kindle ethnic unrest, saying nationalist passion benefit opponent his reform. The Soviet leader told meeting Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relation were worsening some region country, due part active resistance put perestroika corrupt group. Perestroika, or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program widespread economic and social change. State-run medium also indicated Friday that crackdown had begun people Armenia who continue agitate annexation mostly Armenian enclave neighboring republic Azerbaijan. The six-month conflict two republic control Nagorno-Karabakh district ha led mass rally, strike and ethnic violence February. The Supreme Soviet Presidium, government's top executive body, intervened July 18. It rejected any change Nagorno-Karabakh's status called measure develop region's economy and culture. The conflict Nagorno-Karabakh is one most rancorous domestic dispute faced Gorbachev he became Communist Party chief March 1985. He indicated Friday he want defuse tension ethnic group, also punish those who transform tension political crisis. Gorbachev spoke plenary meeting Central Committee, party's policy-making body. A summary his remark wa distributed official Tass news agency. Gorbachev outlined reason current aggravation tension ethnic group some region Soviet Union, Tass said. Among cause, Gorbachev listed lack concern many year specific requirement people and ethnic group, inadequate control mass activity executive personnel, and active resistance put perestroika corrupt group. Tass said that Gorbachev noted that nationalist passion benefit all anti-perestroika force, he suggested increasing accountability Soviet law kindling ethnic strife. Tass not give detail Gorbachev's suggestion. At July 18 Presidium meeting, Soviet leader accused corrupt conservative who oppose his reform hiding Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive. Gorbachev said ground tougher legislation come directly Article 36 1977 Soviet Constitution, which say law can punish any advocacy racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt. Tass said Gorbachev made other proposal how resolve ethnic tension, including increase power each country's 15 republic, law equal use more 100 language spoken Soviet Union and some economic autonomy country's republic and region. In particular, Baltic republic Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, forcibly incorporated Soviet Union 1940, have demanded more say their economic and government affair. The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people Yerevan, Armenia's capital, will face criminal charge incident which activist seeking annexation Nagorno-Karabakh attached slogan their car and drove city. The paper not give date or size mobile demonstration, said 155 driver have had their license revoked and 310 were fined. In it July 18th decision, Presidium also ordered local law enforcement agency ensure order wa restored Caucasus Mountain region. Tass reported Friday that situation wa stabilizing Armenia, said that urging instigator, some strike and protest were continuing. The international community is starting look conflict former Yugoslavia, and is becoming increasingly aware true magnitude and seriousness ethnic and political conflict former Soviet Union. The problem is indeed pressing one. The dispute Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere former Soviet Union are causing great suffering those involved. They are source legitimate concern Russians, who are worried clash close their border. They are concerned too safety ethnic Russians living those country where there are conflict, and economic and social consequence refugee fleeing Russia (whose potential number is estimated more 2m). They believe that problem some former Soviet republic are either ignored or misunderstood. The Russians fear that if they do nothing, conflict will worsen and probably spread. They argue that they have legitimate concern trying resolve conflict that threaten their security. They ask why, when international community is engaged peacemaking and peacekeeping many world's trouble spot, similar effort should not be undertaken hot spot them. Equally, these dispute are legitimate concern Britain, it western partner and whole international community, humanitarian reason and because such flashpoint risk provoking regional instability. If uncontrolled, they pose variety threat European security, including increased traffic drug and arm well international terrorism. Crises Russia's newly independent neighbour may also complicate Russia's relation west: unless they are carefully handled, they risk prejudicing emerging relationship u. The west is sometimes suspicious Moscow's attitude. There are no difference need resolve these conflicts: there are difference how go it. The British government will not underwrite Russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troop will not turn occupying force. Nor are country that secured their independence when Soviet Union wa dissolved keen that west should concede Moscow same role it played Soviet empire. They fear that this would compromise their sovereignty. When they are willing Russian troop play peacekeeping role, they want there be some form international monitoring. This ha meant that, though west lack resource engage directly those trouble spot, it ha been wary appearing endorse Russian involvement instead, case it had imperial tendency. If we are fashion joint approach Russia and it western partner problem peacekeeping former Soviet Union, we must address all these concern. Clearly Russia ha important role play this area. If Russians want international recognition and more active support international community, west turn need guarantee that Russia will not regard recognition it involvement giving it carte blanche former Soviet Union. Peace-keeping former Soviet Union, indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply internationally recognised principle. It need be looked case case basis. Respect sovereignty newly independent country must remain paramount. We agreed that principle underlying Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operation would need include: strict respect sovereignty country involved; invitation government concerned and consent party conflict; commitment parallel political peace process; clear mandate setting out role peacekeeping force (which should whenever possible be multinational character); and exit strategy peacekeeping force deployed. These principle should help stimulate dialogue and political settlement party conflict, focus attention and, where possible, resource settlement conflict former Soviet Union. All this will help enhance Russian peacekeeping practice. Although Conference Security and Co-operation Europe and UN lack resource put large number peacekeeper ground themselves, they may be able suggest measure enhance transparency and monitor peace process. Extending co-operation North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and also co-operation Russia and Nato, might help improve training Russian peacekeeper. This is area we shall need explore further. We also need put much more emphasis preventive diplomacy. One way which we can help prevent conflict is strengthen democratic institution newly independent country former Soviet Union. The CSCE and other international institution can play important role here, drawing newly independent country more active dialogue way promoting democratic value and principle. We discussed way strengthening CSCE's role, including role High Commissioner National Minorities, recent Rome ministerial meeting. We must try find way managing and resolving tension they erupt conflict. It will not be easy, we must try. Potentially explosive cocktail ethnic and political animosity could spread fire intolerance all too easily other country and region. We need deal it together spirit partnership. And we need deal it urgently. Our security is indivisible and we must ensure it vigorous and imaginative effort aimed promoting peace all well right all.

Gorbachev said declaration Gagauz and Dniester republic wa illegal Soviet and Moldavian constitution, were election form legislature and any action those body. The Moldavian legislature ha also voted declare election null and void.

As more severe conflict Nagorno-Karabakh, underlying tension are growing and neither side belief it is losing. In other respect, however, conflict are quite different and illustrate complexity conflict which former Soviet Union is now faced. The Trans Dnestr conflict stem directly breakup Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh ha been source tension Azeris and Armenians century. Moldova (formerly Moldavia) wa finally taken full Soviet control 1944. The Soviet leadership sought stifle any attempt preserve it former link Romania - calling Moldovan separate language Romanian, and constructing separate history Moldovan people. Industry wa largely situated left bank Dnestr, sliver republic next Ukraine, and largely staffed Russians and Ukrainians. Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 cent population, Moldovans accounting 64 cent. The little republic (4.5m people) wa slow respond stirring reform. When it did, 1989, language movement quickly put hardline Communist Party defensive and it lost power 1990 present nationalist government, headed President Mircea Snegur, former secretary Moldovan Party's central committee. From beginning nationalist movement, it wa clear that Russian and, lesser extent, Ukrainian minority would be hostile, reacting law establishing Moldovan official language and call renewed union Romania strike and demonstration, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov. During August coup last year, Moldovan government stoutly rejected it and Trans Dnestr authority welcomed it, siding Soviet army it brief effort impose military rule. Thereafter, two side have gathered military force. The Trans Dnestr side ha been augmented Cossacks nearby area returning their traditional role defender Russia's border.

No new outbreak were reported region border city Osh western Kirghizia, where clash arising land dispute began June 2 ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, Sunni Moslems. The argument involves allocation land densly populated region where housing is scarce. It wa latest series bloody civil conflict trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government. Maj. Gen.

Besides unrest this month Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence also ha been reported recent year Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan. The government ha decided give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled their homeland Josef Stalin their autonomous region it will take year, Tass reported Wednesday. The ice ha been broken. A start ha been made. We're working creating such autonomy, said Rafik Nishanov, chairman chamber Soviet legislature, remark carried official news agency. However, he said, nut and bolt how create region still had be worked out. For example, 10-year program resettlement. People can't just be expelled area move in. The Tatars Crimea and ethnic Germans who lived Volga River were forcibly resettled World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked people out their homeland ground they could not be trusted occupy strategic area. The Tatars and Germans, others, long have been agitating return Siberia and Central Asia their traditional land, and last month Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all people exiled Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated. But other people now occupy land and house that belonged exile, and re-establishing their dominion their home region will not be so simple. The Supreme Soviet took basic decision that two autonmous region should be created Nov. 28 kept it quiet, apparently fearing explosive reaction population now living region. It wa also potentially dangerous precedent: The Soviet Union is patchwork well 100 ethnic group, and many them have outstanding territorial claim. Trouble already ha been reported ethnic Germans and Russians several city Volga. Residents Saratov and Volgograd region have protested prospect seeing many nation's estimated 2 million Germans descending them. Ethnographers estimate there are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars Soviet Union, and another 1 million Turkey. Their protest Kremlin 1987 demanding be allowed return their homeland were first test President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promise greater democracy. Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back Crimea each year lack wholesale permission return. A wave some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrated West Germany this year, many would probably stay if they could be assured their republic, said Irina Ostroukh, researcher Soviet Institute Ethnography who study ethnic Germans. The Nov. 28 plan approved Supreme Soviet recommended German region area where resistance German resettlement wa strongest order avoid ethnic conflict. The explosive conflict Armenians and Azerbaijanis Nagorno-Karabakh region ha led 200 death and hundred thousand refugee last two year. Both side claim control mountainous enclave. The Supreme Soviet charged government creating commmission determine how create region Germans and Crimean Tatars.

Society tends flit hysteria hysteria, said Pat Michaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator symposium. He said 1988 drought, although not dry 1986 drought many place, ha drawn much attention because some affected area include large medium center. I'm worried . that when next drought happens, we are going have rediscover climate problem, said Michaels, president Association State Climatologists. Experts said Thursday that greenhouse effect warming Earth's atmosphere ha brought needed attention change global climate, though it is not directly related drought. Many 13 climatologist and meterologists symposium agreed that Earth's temperature is warming, they debated whether it is short- or long-term phenomenon and it impact Earth. However, Alan Hecht, director National Climate Program Washington, D.C., said uncertainty mean policymakers should begin deal possible effect, especially undertaking policy that make sense their right. Mankind must reduce reliance fossil fuel, he said, becoming more energy efficient, replanting forest and investigating alternative energy supply. Scientists have warned recent year that Earth's atmosphere is gaining carbon dioxide and other gas, which trap heat and cause overall temperature rise. Besides fossil fuel, depletion forest South America ha been blamed increase carbon dioxide and methane. Some have warned that higher temperature will change character many country, example drying out US. Midwest or melting polar ice cap. The symposium wa sponsored The Weather Channel, Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast meeting live. Earlier Thursday, climatologist were told movement planet and moon and sunspot may help lead drought Southeast. There is some evidence that Jupiter go sun it fastest point, there are drought condition Southeast month April and October, Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer said.

The crippling drought hitting North America is expected reduce world grain stock level that may cause food shortage many poor country, UN. Food and Agriculture Organization reported today. The agency project world cereal production 1988 total 1.785 billion ton, only two million ton more last year's level, which wa already expected production. If drought United States ended now, grain production would fall close low level 1983, when drought and farmers' participation government crop reduction program decreased output, agency reported. As result, world grain stock are projected fall 310 million ton, or 17 percent level agency considers necessary safeguard world food security, report said. If crop condition United States and Canada continue deteriorate, ratio could drop further. Such development would have serious implication food security, particularly many low-income, food-deficit country, report said. The high grain price resulting lower supply would hit poor, food-importing country hardest, UN. agency warned. It said rising price could also reduce food aid developed country. The most severely hit crop are coarse grain mostly maize, barley and oat, report said. The agency projected good harvest other part world. In Asia yearly monsoon rain started time, and production Europe and Soviet is expected be larger last year. Grain production South America should be slightly lower this year last.

Lyng's remark were prepared delivery meeting farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editor. A larger portion United States suffered some degree drought stress May and June any point record began 1895, he said. Moreover, July 2, 35 percent contiguous United States wa severe extreme drought category, he said. In 1934, more 60 percent wa so rated, and August 1954 more 50 percent wa that category. Because large early season area now experiencing drought U.S., 1988 appears have potential approach or exceed drought-affected area 1930s and 1950s, Lyng said. Even severe drought, there will be adequate supply food grain and livestock feed grain so that United States will be able take care our domestic need and our export demand, he said. Lyng said total consumption 1988 crop will probably be somewhat le previously estimated because price are much higher.

Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

For apart his puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic thousand interview he gave wa his squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy employee, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on. By his accounting, then, Mr. Lennon wa not dethrone Ward Cleaver all-American dad. His public loved him spite it all -- or perhaps because it all. Mr. Lennon grew celebrity time when such transgression intemperance and adultery (quaint terms!) were losing their social sting. His candor -- if that's what it wa, and not simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything. And so it is ground insufficient candor that resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot debunk, attack his subject. The leitmotif Mr. Lennon's confession wa that his worst day were him, and that Yoko Ono he had last learned prize virtue quietude and domesticity. Now Mr. Goldman is here announce: He didn't tell you half it. Hence this 718-page stew unrelieved sordidness, percolating ""scoops"" that have now been widely publicized People magazine, ""West 57th"" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had thing young boys; that his marriage Ms. Ono wa pocked same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit. The squalid revelation dribble out chemical leak, sliming every page. Remarkably, then, sleazemonger's art ha triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon is worse John Lennon's John Lennon. A great deal this muck manages splash Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portrays cynical manipulator whose major talent lay exploiting Mr. Lennon further her craving fame and wealth. Mr. Goldman, ala, allows pas unremarked obvious irony that this is rather fine thumbnail sketch himself well. The keeper Lennon flame have course been quick point this out. Ms. Ono and her son have taken path preferred offended celebrity, they have hit talk show display their wound. And Rolling Stone magazine, long house organ Lennon publicity machine, recently published extensive rebuttal book, which wa undercut tone priggish indignation bordering comic. Criticizing ""The Lives John Lennon"" insufficient respect fallen Beatle's legacy is rather point -- condemning Charles Manson his bad table manner. The book may indeed be inaccurate, critic have charged. But one can only hope that quibble it veracity do not obscure countless other reason hate Mr. Goldman's book. There is, starter, sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman is sort writer who refers pop song ""pieces,"" though they were concerto. There is his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- drug, sex, music -- that give him license second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. And there is awkward organization, which minor event assume large proportion simple reason that they reflect badly Mr. Lennon, while major event are skipped lightly because -- there go advance! -- they might reveal Mr. Lennon flattering light. All which indicates why ""The Lives John Lennon"" is such wretched book: not because it make good man look bad, because it show no other purpose make man -- whether good man or bad one, we layman will probably never know -- look bad. John Lennon, while he wa alive, enough that himself satisfy all lowest appetite. ---Mr. Ferguson is assistant managing editor The American Spectator.At this point, Lennon say he became househusband theirchild while Yoko ran family business.

Butthe storm gathered strength and speed it spun straight towardthis city, which had survived number miss greatstorms recent years.From moment it became apparent Hugo might strike theSoutheast coast, many Charlestonians conceded that, this time, theirnumber wa up.As Hugo's wind howled plywood board protecting thewindows, reporter wandered and out Riley's office. On hisdesk several candle burned insurance inevitable lossof power.Later there wa sharp crack piece tin roof rippedoff and water seeped burnished wood table CityCouncil chamber. Phone and electric service city command postwas knocked out.During it all, Riley kept close contact NationalWeather Service. As eye storm passed, he took reportersonto porch 188-year-old brick City Hall look thedamage.The initial view, sketched out glow flashlight, wasunsettling: The tin roof wa tossed gutter, slate tile werescattered ground. Bricks, stick and leaf littered thestreet.This is eye hurricane. I've never been one and Ihope I'm never one again, Riley said. It's scarcely latesummer breeze.As storm died dawn, Riley wa out street againin raincoat carrying flashlight get better assessment ofthe damage.Serious fixable, mayor concluded.Damage Hurricane Hugo, which stormed Carolinas and Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings several insurer. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net loss related Hugo reduce pretax earnings $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG ha told them that it must cover first $35 million loss and that it reinsurance agreement will cover bulk remaining damage. AIG insured property Puerto Rico, eastern Caribbean Islands and coastal region Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based St. Paul, Minn, said pretax cost Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount take consideration what St. Paul expects recover it reinsurance contract, company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected disclose Hugo's likely impact it earnings sometime today.

It said that is more three time previous record $165 million set Hurricane Alicia, which hit Houston-Galveston, Texas, area 1983.Supercomputers, satellite and expertise ofseveral hurricane forecaster predicted destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty time fleethe South Carolina coast.But hurricane tracking remains uncertain science.Forecasters National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path Charleston, S.C.All world's knowledge meteorological condition andforecasting change those condition is embodied thosemodels, said Thomas Pyke, head National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.Pinpointing exact point Hugo's landfall wa difficult, butforecasters said Friday that landfall wa predicted time forevacuation.Overall, I think tracking model gave u very good ideawhere Hugo would be so official South Carolina could act atimely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem Hugo wa predicting theintensity storm, which wa upgraded Category 4 hurricanejust hour it slammed Charleston.It is very difficult predict change intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer model that, McAdie said.We really need improve our forecasting ability strength.The hurricane specialist were surprised last-minuteincrease wind speed, which wa reported them Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who ha tracked hurricane 35years, said that couple decade ago, only forecasting toolswere report aircraft or ships.We had no radar or satellite then, so needle say ourforecasts were le accurate, Clark said.In late 1960s, weather service began using satellite toobtain global weather picture. Information satellite isused improve accuracy large-scale model thattelevision viewer see every night.Using information satellite, supercomputer theNational Meteorological Center Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where tracking model constantly change toaccount current weather condition and position thehurricane.To determine track storm, forecaster analyzesupercomputer prediction, satellite data, history similarstorms and current path hurricane.Then they make educated guess landfall.Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel MassachussettsInstitute Technology criticizes current forecasting system.Congress and American people are suffering thecollective delusion that our data problem have been solved bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give pretty picture, he said, not enoughinformation wind and temperature that affect ahurricane's path.Most information actually used predict hurricanescomes flying airplane hurricane, and they do verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say accuracy satellite picture is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have remember that those model used are only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately job theforecaster predict storm's path.Residents took forecaster their wordwhen they warned Hurricane Hugo's fury, and low number ofdeaths powerful storm can be credited this healthyrespect, authority said.The storm, which caused billion damage, claimed 17 life inSouth Carolina, and only two were Charleston area, whichbore brunt Hugo's 135 mph winds.We just feel very thankful that, said Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousand people who were sheltersand ten thousand people who evacuated inland werepotential victim injury and death.Riley and other official credited resident monitoring thehurricane it spun Charleston, and heeding evacuationwarnings.The last big storm hit South Carolina wa Hurricane David in1979, which hit coast pounding southern Florida.Since then several big storm have threatened veered away,and official were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've had so many close call, said Gary Garnet, ameteorologist National Weather Service.But this storm wa very, very strong, he said.

The property claim service division American Insurance Service Group, trade association, is expected announce it estimate total insured loss tomorrow. ""Hugo will be biggest hurricane loss record,"" said one official, far surpassing $752.5 million insurer paid out Frederick ripped several Gulf Coast state 1979. The impact premium rate could be minimal now, analyst expect, because biggest loss will be personal insurance area -- home and auto. Most company typically set aside fund premium they collect every year cover claim they might have pay future. In last three year, hurricane and storm season have been relatively mild, so insurer haven't had dip these fund. And Hugo also stormed Caribbean, foreign insurer are risk some damage those island. Yet, some analyst believe Hugo's huge loss will make dent industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurer le likely slash premium rate further coming month. Rates have been falling late 1986. Udayan Ghose Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. belief these reason might cause rate edge higher mid-1990. For time being, loss Hugo ""will be substantial, they won't be something industry can't handle,"" said Charles L. Ruoff, director strategic planning Fred S. James & Co., New York-based insurance broker. For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimate it will pay claim totaling more $400 million homeowner and some small business. Nationwide Insurance Co., mutual company based Columbus, Ohio, said Hugo ""is single largest claim disaster"" it ha seen it 63-year history. The company, which is largest home and auto insurer North Carolina and No. 3 South Carolina, ha already received 16,000 claim stricken region. Claims could total $100 million, spokesman said. For some insurer, Hugo wa double-whammy. New York-based Continental Corp., which is big insurer Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, said it will take $50 million pretax charge earnings this quarter, reflecting it net exposure damage caused hurricane. ""Hugo will be particularly costly us,"" said John P. Mascotte, Continental's chairman. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which ha extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operation area Hugo hit, and USF&G Corp. Baltimore, big insurer Carolina region, could also be forced take one-time charge third-quarter earnings, analyst said. Some USF&G's loss hit very close home -- it Charleston office wa destroyed hurricane. Both USF&G and Cigna declined predict whether they would take charge; USF&G said it would be responsible first $22.5 million loss, and it reinsurance would cover bulk additional loss. Hugo could have marginal impact third-quarter income Travelers Corp., Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., according industry analyst. Mr. Ruoff Fred S. James belief that if loss Hugo total much $5 billion, insurer won't feel enough ""financial pain, such not being able pay shareholder dividends,"" compel them boost premium rate right away. He explained that first six month this year, net income industry declined slightly 1988, insurance company were still earning adequate rate return equity. He also noted that industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently $125 billion, is also plentiful. Generally, insurer can book $3 premium every $1 surplus. Right now, premium total $200 billion, he said. An official Nationwide Insurance noted that company ha $1 surplus every $2 insurance that it writes. Insurers also buy protection themselves reinsurance paying another company portion premium bear some loss. Michael Lewis Dean Witter Reynolds said loss Hugo could be big enough ""temporarily"" increase reinsurance rate. Although reinsurance will limit exposure some company, loss they must still cover could hurt third-quarter result. Niagara Exchange Corp., based Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report loss operation third quarter, and possibly year, because substantial loss that it Charleston Insurance Co. unit face result hurricane. State Farm, nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance. It belief it reserve are plentiful enough absorb it loss, spokesman said.

Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who heeded Hurricane Center warnings and evacuated before the storm's arrival.Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.","American Insurance Service Group says Hurricane Hugo, which ravaged the Caribbean and the Carolinas last week, is responsible for record hurricane losses. State Farm Insurance expects claims of approximately $500 million in the Carolinas. Nationwide Insurance is projecting claims near $100 million. Though the Hugo-related losses are substantial, most companies have sufficient funds to cover them. Some companies, however, will reduce third-quarter earnings.Hugo slammed into Charleston Thursday night with top winds of 135 mph. Upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane hours before it struck the historic city, it caused widespread damage throughout the Carolinas. Only two lives were lost in Charleston, however, and only 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who monitored the hurricane and evacuated.  Computer models at the National Hurricane Center used satellite information to track Hugo's path into Charleston. Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, the governor declared a state of emergency and National Guardsmen were ordered to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and shorefront. Thousands fled inland or went to shelters.Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.",Forecasters Saved Lives During Deadly Hurricane Hugo,"Hurricane Hugo which hit Charleston, S.C. head-on the night of Sept. 21, 1989 was the costliest storm in the city's 300-year history. Despite widespread devastation (insured losses approached $5 billion) there were only 17 deaths in South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself thanks to accurate forecasting in time for an effective evacuation.","On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, South Carolina head-on with winds at 135 mph causing extensive property damage, but claiming only 17 lives in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself. The relatively low casualties were a result of an accurate prediction of the point of windfall by hurricane forecasters, effective evacuation measures and good response from residents. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion, by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area, but insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims.","Hurricane Hugo approached the Carolina coast on Sept. 21, 1989 with its windspeed up to 125 mph and threatened to hit between Savannah, GA and Charleston, S.C. It hit Charleston head-on with winds of 135 mph and then proceeded northwestward hitting other population centers rather than heading up the coast or out to sea as expected. Fortunately Hurricane forecasters analyzing computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane made an accurate educated guess as to the point of landfall in time for threatened residents to evacuate. As a result, only 17 deaths resulted in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston which took the brunt of the storm. Charleston had been through many hard times in its 300- year history, but Hugo was by far the worst hurricane in its experience. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion but insurers were confident that they could handle all claims. Disaster aid came to Charleston from an unexpected source. Kingston, New York  raised funds to aid Charleston in thanks for 1,000 New York pounds sent by the South Carolina governor in 1778 to help the citizens of Kingston after it was burned by the British.",,,,

The forecast todaycalled slight chance thunderstorm central and southernOhio.The death toll flash flood thatswept rural area eastern Ohio rose 20 Sunday assearchers dug two creek and dived Ohio River.Sixteen people remained missing.Workers used shovel and pick dig creek bank, andsifted debris place marked red flag, where searchdogs indicated they'd detected human scent, said National GuardCapt. Jim Boling.Divers worked where two creek empty Ohio.Four body were found Sunday. But two those were notimmediately identified, and list missing wa not revised toaccount them.The number missing dropped 16 other two body andthe removal two other names: woman who called say she wassafe and person who authority weren't sure lived area,said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.The 20th victim wa pulled mouth Pipe Creek theOhio River, seven mile south Shadyside, Vogt said.Another body wa found debris Wegee Creek, and two bodieswere found earlier Ohio, he said.That brought confirmed death toll Thursday's flood to20, including five children.Twenty-three dog team four state were searching forvictims, said Boling. The digging will continue least throughTuesday, said Fire Chief Mark Badia.The thing you find once you start these brush pile andpiles tree are car, and they have be torn apart andsearched separately, Badia said. Everything you turn createsa different situation.But Vogt said he doubted many missing would be foundalive.It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody aliveout there, he said. You can't swim out there that long theOhio River.The Wegee and Pipe creek overflowed Thursday night duringstorms that poured 5{ inch rain eastern Ohio 3{ hours.The flood destroyed many 70 house and damaged 40others.Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some ofthose were later found dead, while notified authority thatthey were safe.Officials also learned that some those feared missing hadmoved out area. Officials were comparing county propertylists and data Census Bureau information fromresidents and relative, Boling said.Investigators Sunday blamed flash flood unusuallyheavy rainstorm that overwhelmed designed flow capacity ofthreebridges creek. Badia said rainwater running downhillsides forced debris creek, forming dam eachbridge. The dam broke water pressure.Eventually bridge couldn't hold any more. The debrisbroke loose, and that's when we got three big gush water, hesaid.As rescue effort continued, National Guard cleared roadsand bridge leading stricken area.Eighteen Ohio county have been declared federal disaster areassince tornado and flooding first struck May 25.Across border West Virginia, Gov. Gaston Caperton saidSunday he had no precise dollar figure damage floodingFriday five-mile stretch New Martinsville and innearby Ohio County, estimated it will run million ofdollars.No death or serious injury were reported.Caperton toured flooded area Wheeling and Doolin Runcommunity New Martinsville. He said he saw tremendousdevastation hundred house, house trailer and cars.State Public Safety Secretary Joseph Skaff estimated thatrepairing and replaceing bridge and road will cost $750,000.National Guard soldier helped cleanup Sunday.The death toll last week's flashflood mounted 21 today when body wa found Ohio River,and authority said there wa little hope 14 people stilllisted missing.It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody aliveout there. You can't swim out there that long Ohio River,said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.The search missing wa suspended briefly this morningwhen thunderstorm rolled area. Heavy rain fell forabout 45 minute, swelling Wegee Creek, one two creek thatoverflowed Thursday night's flash flood.By midmorning, muddy creek wa nearly crossing road aboutthree mile upstream where flood inflicted mostdamage. Lt. Dean Irvin Ohio Army National Guard said therewere no immediate report additional property damage.The body found this morning wa Ohio River nearMoundsville, W.Va., 10 mile south Shadyside, according toChuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.The number name list missing dropped 18 14with identity three victim and call one personalerting authority that she wa safe, Vogt said. One therecovered body remains unidentified. Authorities are not rulingout possibility that other people not list could bemissing.Four body were recovered Sunday.Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some thoselater were found dead, while notified authority that theywere safe and official learned that still more had moved out ofthe area.Wegee and Pipe creek overflowed storm that dumped 5{inches rain 3{ hour. The flood destroyed many 70houses and damaged 40 others.Most those whose home and belonging were swept away thewall water will have put their life back together largelywithout benefit insurance.Few people coal-mining and steel-making area carriedflood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damagefrom Thursday's flood, resident and insurer said.We didn't think we needed have flood insurance. For what?That creek never flooded. Then this. Everybody just got wipedout, said Julia Kulazenka.Rainwater running hillside had forced debris thecreeks and formed dam bridge spanning them, Shadyside FireChief Mark Badia said.Eventually bridge couldn't hold any more. The debrisbroke loose, and that's when we got three big gush water,Badia said.The home Mrs. Kulazenka shared her husband his deathlast July wa damaged Wegee Creek raged out control. She saidreplacing machine shop, garage, deck and automobile she and herson owned would cost more $80,000.They told u homeowners' won't do u no good. So unless thegovernment help u rebuild, I don't know what I'll do thisplace, Mrs. Kulazenka said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open anoffice Tuesday Shadyside accept application residentsfor low-interest loan and grant help them rebuild.Before flood, land Wegee Creek valley fetchedhandsome price, said Kulazenka's son, Charles Kulazenka. That wasespecially welcome resident, many whom were either retiredor laid job coal mine Belmont County, whereunemployment April wa 6.8 percent.Ground wa premium here this because it wasjust city limit (of Shadyside). It wa quiet andpeaceful and people were looking buy and build new home outhere.

Look light created14 billion year ago and arriving your eye only this instant.Ride beginning everything, almost, BigBang 10 or 20 thousand million year ago. See star born and seethem die. Watch galaxy form. Follow flow gas theMilky Way's halo. Peer deep universe, so many starsin our galaxy that it would take person more lifetimeto count, hundred billion other galaxy each 200billion stars.For scientist, and then rest u, all that becomespossible now that space shuttle Discovery ha carried theHubble Space Telescope sky see what no one ha seenbefore. The telescope, silvery tube long tanker truck,has unmatched ability detect and capture faintest light.Light, speeding 186,000 mile second, is themessenger creation. Tracking trail light today tothe first moment contains all information we will ever haveabout creation universe.The Hubble promise give science open window perhaps tothe first echo creation. This is world-class event, ifastronomy is not your thing.Superlatives?In history optical astronomy there have been two greatleaps resolution universe: Galileo's telescope theautumn 1609, and Hubble Space Telescope April 1990. Eric J. Chaisson, senior scientist Space Telescope ScienceInstitute Baltimore.One more?No one ever made anything that good, James Westphal,California Institute TechnologyAnother?Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that theHubble telescope will literally be dawn new era inastronomy.Eras rarely can be proclaimed advance. But HST, namedafter Edwin Powell Hubble, hold that kind promise.Hubble wa astronomer first half century whoconcluded not only that distant galaxy are moving away Earthbut that farther away they are, faster they move. Thetheory expanding universe supported belief that theuniverse originated cosmic explosion and that all matter isstill rushing site that so-called Big Bang.Astronomers think Big Bang occurred 12 billion 20 billionyears ago and sent entire universe flying out incrediblespeed and heat. Eventually matter cooled and condensed intogalaxies, star and planets.There are bigger telescope Hubble, they are all onEarth and all subject major limitation atmosphere which is fine breathing lousy seeing through. Theproblem skywatching layer air ha been likened tobirdwatching bottom swimming pool.The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing view ofEarth's sister planet, had travel 12 year get close enoughfor picture they whizzed past. With Hubble, say scientistEdward Weiler, such picture are possible any time we want.The telescope is 42.5 14 foot and consists 94.5-inchprimary mirror that gather incoming light.On clear, dark night you can see flashlight two milesaway, say Weiler, chief NASA scientist Hubble project.With 28-power telescope you can see it moon 250,000miles away. With HST you could see firefly Australia fromWashington.Ground controller GoddardSpace Flight Center finally made contact today two mainantennas $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope tryingfor more six hour lock on.Applause erupted Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md.,as glitch that marred Hubble's first full day space wassolved.We have confirmation that we have achieved communication withthe Tracking and Data Relay Satellite high-gain antennasystem, said NASA's Dave Drachlis.Engineers had said all they believed antenna wereworking all right and that problem wa incorrectly pointingeither satellite or TDRS, orbiting communicationssatellite that act switchboard.In successful attempt, they nearly doubled width theantennas' beam take more territory, sweep 6.2degrees 10.8 degrees.The telescope's low-gain antenna, which receive and transmitinformation much slower rate and can be used emergencies,were working well.Space shuttle Discovery wa 46 mile away, available remedycertain problem. The outage wa not problem which spacewalker would have been summoned.The five astronaut were otherwise busy making picture ofstorms Texas their 380-mile-high perch, and doingexperiments.Steve Terry, director team calibrating various aspect ofthe telescope, said first outage wa caused human error andwas not serious problem. It began 1 and 1:30 am. EDT andlasted 45 minute hour, he said.The second failure occurred 6:44 am. when controllersattempted send signal telescope's two high-gainantennas TDRS.This time it wa pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, aGoddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft and we thinkinexperience dealing it wa cause.The telescope, embarking 15-year search new world, wasreleased shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minutesnag that almost sent two astronaut emergency spacewalk.Mission Control awakened crew early today loudrendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite.Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake thatsong, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are alot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday andHubble had good night while you were asleep.We appreciate good word everybody, repliedDiscovery Commander Loren Shriver.After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discoveryaway telescope and put shuttle series ofmaneuvers, last one completed this morning, parkDiscovery orbit 46 mile Hubble.The telescope really looked great we flew away it, andwe sure hope it doe good work, Shriver said Wednesday.Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks all great workyou've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud ofyou.Scientists have hailed Hubble NASA's most expensiveunmanned spacecraft greatest advance astronomy sinceGalileo raised small telescope his eye nearly 400 year ago.Discovery and it five astronaut will follow telescopewhile controller Goddard center make sure Hubble isoperating properly, such responding directional commands.The next milestone is Friday, when telescope's 10-footaperture door is be opened, exposing finely polished94.5-inch mirror starlight.Then Tuesday, NASA expects release first image fromthe telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina.Data will follow month or two.If aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery couldreturn telescope so two astronaut could perform spacewalkto fix it.Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said telescope would betested today it ability maneuver aperture dooris opened.We want be full control so we don't ever endanger theHubble putting aperture door close sunlight, hesaid. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitiveinstruments.On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used shuttle's50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope and hoistit cargo bay.One telescope's solar array unreeled it mast asexpected and started providing power telescope's batteries,which otherwise had only eight hour charge.But there wa trouble second panel. It wouldn't budgewhen latch were released, and then moved fifth its39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all way outon third attempt.By final attempt, astronaut Bruce McCandless and KathrynSullivan were their space suit airlock, 30 minute awayfrom taking tool hand and going outer-space maintenancecall.Wojtalik said cause problem is unknown.The 8{-hour procedure wa performed 380 mile Earth, 70miles higher any shuttle ha ever flown. The orbit wasdictated need put Hubble Earth's distortingatmosphere.Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost thebeginning time, studying star and galaxy so distant theirlight ha taken 14 billion year reach Earth. They hope todetermine how and when universe wa formed, currently estimatedat 15 billion year ago.The telescope originally wa scheduled launch 1983 butwas delayed technical problem and Challenger accident.Discovery, which blasted orbit Tuesday, is scheduled toland Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.Five astronaut boarded Discoverytoday second try sending Hubble Space Telescope intoorbit scan outermost reach universe clue tothe beginning time.Astronomers are starting tingle again anticipation ofwhat Hubble will be able accomplish, said Lennard Fisk,head NASA science activities.Air Force forecaster said there wa 90 percent chance theweather would be favorable launching shuttle thescheduled time 8:31 am. EDT.More half million gallon liquid hydrogen and liquidoxygen were pumped space ship's fuel tank midnight.The astronaut, wearing bright orange flight suit, climbed intothe crew cabin just dawn wa breaking Kennedy SpaceCenter.The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will giveastronomers new set eye and ear that we don't have, saidWilliam Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program.It's going change our perspective altogether. I can't saywhat we're going learn, I'll be astounded if we don't learnmany new things.Discovery wa aiming altitude 380 mile, highest ashuttle ha ever gone, so telescope can be placed it properorbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is 35thshuttle mission.Columbia, which journey space next month Astroobservatory, sat launch pad 1.6 mile Discovery, only thesecond time pad have been occupied; first wa 1986just Challenger explosion.Hubble ha been waiting take it place space 1983,delayed technical problem and Challenger accident. Thelatest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch wasscrubbed four minute liftoff because faulty power uniton shuttle.The mood Kennedy Space Center wa considerably lessfestive first launch attempt, when hundred ofastronomers gathered their families.The day launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley willuse shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescopeinto space. Veteran spacewalker Bruce McCandless II and KathrynSullivan will assist if problem develops.Discovery will follow Hubble 40 mile away two daysuntil it lens cap is opened, exposing finely polished94.5-inch mirror starlight.Hubble is not expected start providing scientific data bysatellite month or more liftoff. However, NASA said itwill release it first image open star cluster theconstellation Carina week launch.In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million hasbeen spent spare part, astronaut training and computer softwareto operate instrument. The European Space Agency contributed$250 million 15 percent viewing time.NASA estimate it will cost $200 million year operate andmaintain telescope space.During it 15-year working lifetime, telescope will provideastronomers 10 time better resolution and 25 time moresensitivity ground-based observatory. As result, they willbe able study star and galaxy so distant their light ha beentraveling Earth 14 billion years.Astronomers hope learn whether universe wa created 15billion year ago believed and uncover some mysterysurrounding galaxy, black hole and quasar. Hubble also isexpected shed light how and when universe might end.The telescope is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,who discovered 1920s that universe is expanding. Hiswork gave rise Big Bang theory that universe wa createdby tremendous explosion.In addition Hubble, Discovery carry human skull filledwith sensor measure space radiation that astronautsreceive. It is skull's third trip space.The shuttle is end it five-day mission landing atEdwards Air Force Base, Calif.Seven year late, Hubble SpaceTelescope is where it belongs, out this world and search ofothers so distant that they may have been formed beginningof time.Less five hour it rode space shuttleDiscovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope sent it firsttest radio signal. At sign life, applause and cheer eruptedin Mission Control Houston.As we can tell, everything look perfect, saidastronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesdaywill be drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space.Discovery, trailing arc white smoke brilliant bluesky, carried silver-colored telescope orbit 380 milesabove Earth higher 70 mile any previous shuttle. Therethe Hubble will stay search yet-unseen wonder creationwith instrument that can look 14 billion year backward time.Our window universe! NASA launch commentator GeorgeDiller exulted Discovery rose it seaside launch pad.It's beautiful day have Hubble Space Telescope orbitinstead here Earth it's been so many year, saidNASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's it element and I'mdelighted.The telescope wa supposed be launched 1983, technicalproblems and Challenger accident delayed it deployment. Itsuffered further delay two week ago when countdown wasstopped four-minutes-to-go point because faultyhydraulic unit shuttle.While it remained Earth, telescope cost $7 million amonth exercise and keep readiness. In it first day space,that checkout and testing continued remotely control theGoddard Space Flight Center Maryland.On hand watch Discovery launching wa contingent ofscientists who have hailed Hubble greatest advance inastronomy Galileo raised small telescope his eye nearly400 year ago.Truly referred early-day astronomer when he wa askedabout long delay getting telescope it workingstation.Somebody other day said, `Who remembers day thatGalileo picked his telescope look stars?' saidTruly, former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day welaunch Hubble, it matter that we do it right.The telescope is 43 foot long and 14 foot diameter, thesize railroad tank car. When it fly free, it will receiveelectrical power it six scientific instrument twowing-like solar array that extend outward each side.It is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whotheorized that universe wa expanding and that farther awaya galaxy is, faster it is traveling. That gave support thetheory that massive explosion Big Bang created theuniverse 10 20 billion year ago.The Hubble is expected help provide answer two majorquestions: How old is universe? How big is it?The telescope ha two mirror, one 94.5 inch diameter, theother 12 inch. Two instrument are camera, two arespectrometers and one is photometer. In addition, finepointing system act sixth instrument providing precisemeasurement distances.On Wednesday, Hawley is grapple 12{-ton telescope withthe shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out cargo bay, pointit, and long checkout drop it overboard orbit itsown.In cargo bay, telescope receives electrical power fromthe shuttle. But juice is cut when instrument is lifted outand it will depend internal battery solar panel areextended receive light sun.Should solar panel not deploy, mission specialist BruceMcCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partiallydressed space suit, ready go open cargo bay tounfurl array manually.Discovery's launch wa not it problems.With 31 second left countdown, computer that runsthe final moment liftoff refused close fuel valve andstopped launch process. The problem wa overcome and theshuttle lifted 8:34 am. EDT, three minute late.The shuttle is scheduled land Sunday 9:49 am. EDT atEdwards Air Force Base California.On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, theshuttle's windshield wa splattered several fleck ofthings. He said windshield wa streaked debris andthat it also wa smeared when spent booster rocket fell offduring climb orbit.The astronaut also had problem their UHF radio circuit,and one ship's small rear thruster wa inoperative. Neitherproblem wa considered serious.Discovery's astronaut overcamebalky equipment send Hubble Space Telescope floating freefrom shuttle today 15-year quest secret theuniverse.The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3minutes altitude 380 mile high atmosphere,which ha limited view ground-based telecopes.Discovery, go Hubble release, Mission Control told thecrew 3:37 pm. EDT. The event occurred minute later theshuttle slowly and carefully backed away.The final hour it release were nightmare groundcontrollers they commanded unfurling two solar panelsthat power telescope's instruments.The starboard panel balked twice it wa being pulled itsreel. Mission Control ordered space-walking astronaut be readyto go out cabin help. But there wa third try and itwas successful.We have confirmation that solar array wing thestarboard side ha been deployed, telescope control center inMaryland said.So we have good news, said Dave Drachlis, Hubblecontrol center.The deployment two 39-foot panel allowed sun power toflow telescope's battery, relieving worry that theywould use their eight-hour charge.Before astronaut Steve Hawley wa able lift 12{-tontelescope cargo bay shuttle's mechanical arm, itsinstruments had be disconnected shuttle's power andshifted batteries.Precisely one day lifting Launch Pad 39B atKennedy Space Center, Hubble Space Telescope is ready fly onits own, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The game hasbegun. The race is on. The clock is ticking.Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put onspacesuits and entered airlock order be ready walkoutside and pull out array had mechanical deployment thesolar panel failed.Cameras Discovery showed telescope, being held theend 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight it silver surfaceand turning Earth background.Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shrivermaneuvered shuttle it deployment position, it nosepointed sun. That wa put telescope's solararrays, once unfurled, proper angle quickly startcollecting energy and protect telescope's fixed star trackerswhile instrument wa being held payload bay.Discovery is orbit 380 mile Earth, 70 mile higherthan any previous shuttle. The orbit wa dictated need toput telescope Earth's distorting atmosphere.For those technically inclined this morning, I'd passon quote day on-board astronomer (Hawley),something effect that big marble sure look far awaytoday, Shriver said.The five astronauts' busy day began musical note early thismorning Mission Control played song called Space is OurWorld, written member Discovery's training team and aHouston-area group, Private Numbers.Controllers monitoring telescope Goddard Space FlightCenter Maryland said Tuesday that no problem had been detectedso far Hubble, most expensive and complex unmannedspacecraft ever built.Everything ha just being going clockwork, said RonSchlagheck, shift director orbital verification Goddard.Everybody is excellent spirits.The Hubble telescope, delayed technical problem and 1986Challenger accident, ha waited seven year take it place inspace. It finally got ride orbit Tuesday morning aboardDiscovery.Hubble will allow astronomer study star and galaxy sodistant their light ha taken 14 billion year reach Earth. Itis expected provide clue age and size universe,and it may solve mystery quasar, pulsar and black holesand find star planet that could conceivably supportlife.The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 foot long and 14 foot indiameter, size railroad tank car. When it is inorbit, it will receive electrical power it six scientificinstruments two winglike solar arrays.It is named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whosediscovery 1920s that universe is expanding gave riseto Big Bang theory that universe wa created atremendous explosion 10 billion 20 billion year ago.The Hubble Space Telescope wasawakened it self-induced sleep today it wa still withoutthe use it high-speed antenna, and it science instrumentswere hold, unable begin any observations.We are out `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, asupervisor engineer controlling telescope. He said thetelescope wa running normal control-all mode, where itsown computer and sensor guide where it is pointing.Discovery's astronaut, meanwhile, packed their gear areturn Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observation Earthand talked ground-based reporter their flight.Pilot Charles Bolden said he wa especially upbeat thewidespread public awareness telescope, which is expectedeventually look back 14 billion light year nearly thebirth universe.It's hard go somewhere and find someone who ha never heardof Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It make littlekids' eye light up. It make little kid want learn how addand subtract and study science.The telescope's big eye ha remained open, Hubble had beenin safe mode all motion stopped because earlierproblems linking high-speed dish antenna relaysatellite. The antenna are primary link relayingscientific data ground.Terry said that safe mode, one tape recordersin telescope read telemetry signal all it system andthat these would be played Earth and analyzed when antennasare working properly.We expect use that data investigate what happened, hesaid. Engineers are able send command telescope itssecondary antenna communication system is not useful forscientific data, which must be transmitted high rate speed.We're putting scientific instrument hold mode, ineffect standby mode, he said.Shortly 6 am. EDT, controller Goddard SpaceFlight Center Greenbelt, Md., completed series commandsthat took telescope out it safe mode and then began runa 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health.It will take another day $1.5 billion telescope isoperating way it wa supposed this point startupprocess, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.We're backing very deliberate and slow and carefulapproach these problem, Olivier said Friday. This is notthe time do anything dumb.The telescope problem have put flight center several daysbehind, five astronaut who deployed it earlier this weekwere sticking their schedule.Landing is scheduled 9:48 am. EDT Sunday Edwards AirForce Base, Calif., flight controller were keeping closewatch weather.Winds were predicted be 20 mph gust 29 mph.Mission rule dictate that headwind cannot exceed 29 mph attouchdown.The shuttle carry enough supply stay orbit three daysbeyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.Mission Control awakened crew member 1:30 am. EDTtoday playing song, Cosmos.Thanks wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate fortoday, said Commander Loren Shriver.The song wa selected honor Hubble Space Telescope,which is now open business, said Mission Control commentatorJames Hartsfield.The astronaut were finish their experiment andphotography today and pack trip home. They also planned tohold news conference space reporter JohnsonSpace Center.Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were run series oftests make certain shuttle's computer and control jet wereready return Earth.The crew deployed Hubble Wednesday they had stayed closeto telescope case there wa trouble opening aperturedoor. Mission specialist Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivanwere prepared perform space walk today crank it open inorbit 380 mile Earth.But that proved unnecessary when door wa opened Fridaymorning, exposing telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye tostarlight first time.Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscope stoppedworking when door opened, engineer later got them back online. The gyroscope were knocked out motion and that, too,kept telescope safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, directorof orbital verification Goddard.A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's system were set atconservative limit first operation and that caused manymalfunctions. There also were two communication outage totalingseveral hours.Hubble is designed safe mode so it can be master ofits destiny case contact orbiting communicationssystem is lost extended period, Terry said.NASA had planned release it first test image thetelescope Tuesday, showing open star cluster theconstellation Carina.

The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990.

Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,

Panfil won London Marathon 2:26:31, her personalbest, and won New York City Marathon 1990.TOMORROW evening, just Olympic closing ceremony, last and oneof most prestigious event Games will be held. It is also withoutdoubt most gruelling. Run high heat, high humidity, high pollutionlevels and extraordinary course, Barcelona Olympic men'smarathon will prove one most physically demanding ever run. There arelots figure show why. It is estimated that when race begin inMataro, seaside town north Barcelona, temperature will be analready-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards marathon's end, however, radiantheat thrown building could be subjecting runner atemperature 30`C. More debilitating still, relative humidity inBarcelona August rise high 80 cent. With more 10kilometres still go, most course is upward run. The last 4.6km,which take runner 60m higher still Olympic stadium top ofthe hill Montjuic, ha average gradient more 4.5 cent, andincludes some section 7 cent, equivalent skiing term steep'red' run. But we do not need figure convince u extraordinarydifficulty tomorrow's race. Last Saturday, Olympic stadium, Iwatched final moment and aftermath women's marathon, begun atthe same time day and run similar condition. Never any eventvoluntarily entered into, sporting or otherwise, have I seen such sign ofphysical and mental distress. The race wa won Unified Team'sValentina Yegorova 2 hour 32 minute, time considerably slower thanthat achieved woman le demanding Olympic marathon course LosAngeles and Seoul. After her nearest competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, camein eight second later, they had energy - bout grimacing andlowering their head their knee - embrace each other and smile forthe cameras.It wa different story 'mixed zone,' area stadiumwhere athlete recover their event. As runner runner stumbledand limped room - several were brought senseless stretcher -the scene seemed be populated exhausted boat people rescued afterweeks exposure and deprivation sea.As photographer calmly shot roll film foot her face,Manuela Machado Mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently apotted palm. Several competitor lay prone and gasping ground aswater wa poured them; stood hunched over, grasping theirabdomens.If anyone moved all, it wa agonised face and slowest ofhobbles. These are not sort scene likely promote enthusiasm formarathon running or ideal Olympic competition.Chris Brasher, organiser London marathon, wa hand witness thesuffering, and wa incensed. Male marathon runner will face same kindof problem heat, humidity, and over-demanding terrain, he said.In his opinion, gearing marathon prime-time TV viewing and having theevent end top hill sake stadium spectator wasunjustified and 'sell-out commercialism.'To put marathon late afternoon, rather first thing inthe morning (the normal practice), and then make them run 4km hillis just criminal my opinion,' said Brasher, former Olympic gold medalathlete and noted sportswriter.I spoke Britain's Steve Brace, winner Paris marathon 1989 and1990, Berlin marathon last year and competitor Barcelona event.He agrees that run will be highly demanding, and while he regardsOlympic marathon running pinnacle his career, he is cautious abouttomorrow's slog.Like almost all athlete running tomorrow, Brace is professionalrunner who specialises marathon. He take objective, long-term viewof his profession. As income-earner, marathon running is activity withliabilities and limitation, and requires business management well asphysical ability.The winner London marathon earns tidy Dollars 50,000 and NewYork, Boston and Japanese run are all same prize-winning category.But these and le financially-rewarding event are physically debilitating,and can only be won if competitor is top physical shape.With their career and financial prospect mind, top-level runnersnormally only run two marathon year. As Brace say, when you have onlytwo pay-days out 365, you choose, plan and train them greatcare.Brace train extremely carefully indeed. 'Running marathon is easypart,' he say. 'The hard part is lead-up achieving performancelevel required.' He start training three month event running80 mile week and then building progressively. For last six week heruns 120 mile week.Normally he would hope that such routine brings pay-off. But Olympicmarathon is exception: only top-level marathon that carry no prizemoney. Brace say that spite prestige and possible financialspin-offs involved, 'it doe not necessarily make sense run win.'Given highly demanding nature course and their desire preservephysical condition race that do bring money, he say, many runnerswill give le their best effort.Nonetheless, there are plenty whose consideration stretch purelyfinancial. Italian Gelindo Bordin, who came first 1988 Seoul Olympicmarathon, is strong contender. So is Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who camethird Seoul. Ibrahim Hussein Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi Japan arealso possible winners.None them, though, will make molehill out steep and formidableascent Montjuic.A crowd size small city will squeeze starting line here March 1 run 26 mile, 385 yard. And cheering every step that distance will be more dozen corporate sponsor and licensee. Makers car, soda pop, sportswear, copier, computer -- hospital -- have tagged their name Los Angeles Marathon. In promoter's word, this run is ""a marketing event legs,"" reflecting marathoning's growing importance upscale product promotion. Runners, it seems, are well-heeled lot. A study Mercedes-Benz found that 42% family head making $40,000 year or more jog regularly. Of potential buyer showing Mercedes dealer, 47% are jogger. With those number mind, car maker ha become sponsor three marathon -- New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- well other running race. Marathons have had corporate backing some time. But Los Angeles is ahead pack making distance running commercial spectacle. The city that invented corporate-sponsored Olympics ha created marathon -- artfully dressed Olympic-type amateur race, built ground make money closely held company that control it -- well city. ""I took air and made event,"" say William Burke, founder and president Los Angeles Marathon Inc. For man whose running day ended his high school track team, Mr. Burke is turning lot head world marathoning. Last year, it first time out, Los Angeles race attracted nearly 11,000 runner -- four time number forecast and enough make it third -- largest race US. The event also pulled $4 million cash and service it sponsor, leaving organizer $370,000 red ink. This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect gross $5 million cash and service and break even. Next year, they say, profit is possible. More 18,000 runner are expected this year. An audience perhaps million and half or more will line route, drawn part advertisement 75 million Coca-Cola can and 2,500 billboard Los Angeles area. Marketing expert say festive atmosphere big crowd street make marathon attractive sponsor. For cost 30-second ad Super Bowl, company can sponsor marathon and ""take city,"" say Lesa Ukman, editor Special Events Reports, Chicago-based newsletter. The Los Angeles organizer and sponsor have perhaps done more their counterpart elsewhere publicize event. Los Angelenos are seeing plug race million grocery bag, milk carton and loaf bread, addition soda can, billboard and other source. The venerable New York Marathon is taking note. The New York Road Runners Club, organizer race, stopped promoting event some year ago because it had all runner it wanted. Now, Fred Lebow, group's president, say he is encouraging sponsor promote race Los Angeles sponsor do. The promotion Los Angeles is unabashed. ""We tell people that if they're looking new way crack Los Angeles market, this is it,"" say Mr. Burke. The pitch ha attracted like Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Los Angeles; Vons Cos., large supermarket chain; Los Angeles Times; Sears Savings Bank unit Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc. One supporter is Ellesse USA, sportswear and shoe producer. A $50,000 fee enables company use marathon's name it ads; Ellesse will spend additional $100,000 dressing race personnel T-shirts and warm-up suit, showing it clothes marathon's public ""Expo"" sponsors' ware, and posting dozen big street banner course. The company ha rented more 500 billboard cut-rate price $120,000 Patrick Media Group, marathon sponsor. The discount, 50%, wa important. ""We couldn't have bought that kind exposure normally,"" say Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director. Ellesse, which also sponsor New York run, find West Coast event more freewheeling. ""They have let u do we want,"" say Ms. Cialone. For instance, product banner route -- almost impossible arrange New York -- are snap Los Angeles. The city, fact, is partner race. After competitive bidding, it awarded eight-year contract Los Angeles Marathon Inc. put race. The exclusive franchise call race organizer this year pay minimum $60,000 fee or 4% gross cash receipt city. The organizer also will pay cost city service marathon, estimated $100,000. The race sponsor and city official are trading freely good will generated Los Angeles's role host 1984 Olympics. The logo marathon is shield laurel wreath. Some poster show Los Angeles Coliseum it torch and giant Olympic symbol. ""The World Returns Los Angeles,"" proclaims one Mercedes-Benz ad. Race director are called ""commissioners,"" term borrowed 1984 Olympic organization, which Mr. Burke wa commissioner tennis. And Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portraying race civic celebration, thrives volunteer. Some 7,500 people will work free monitor course race day. And two-thirds race's office staff work pay. ""I couldn't buy this,"" Mr. Burke say, gesturing crowded race headquarters. Not everyone work free. Big-name runner, instance, want be paid lot. And here, organizer have pinched penny. While some runner will be paid appear, this year's field, last year's, lack some superstar who race Boston, New York and London. Grete Waitz, one best woman marathoner, wanted $100,000 appear Los Angeles; she wa turned down. Mr. Burke say Australian runner Rob de Castella made it known his agent that he wouldn't run any marathon spring but, $25000, he'd be happy say Los Angeles event wa tempting. Mr. Burke say he slammed phone. ""We won't spend extraordinary amount money any single runner detriment other runners,"" he say. Mr. de Castella's agent denies story entirely. What Los Angeles lack superstar, it plan make number. This year's race may challenge New York and London largest marathon ever run. Some 20,500 started New York race last year. Mr. Lebow, organizer New York event, say next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number. For one sponsor, this may be mixed blessing. Orthopaedic Hospital, not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship is part publicity campaign, provides emergency care station marathon route. Last year, one every 20 runner needed aid. Along sprain, strain and blister came more serious case exhaustion and hypothermia. A spokeswoman says: ""We advised 250 people quit race.""The Olympic trial, scheduled January, have made Nichols' job mucheasier this year.

She added:I'm sure sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us,too.The 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't when advertiser began clamoring pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton. She went grin relentlessly some $5 million worth commercial endorsement -- surely Olympic record itself. But when 1988 Summer Games ended Sunday night, so, too, chance American athlete follow her footstep. Ad agency executive, who spend every fourth year glued their TV set, hoping pick out next star hawk their clients' product, say that this Olympiad wa dud. ""I suspect this will go dullest history Olympics,"" say Jerry Della Femina, chairman ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS. ""This is first Olympics passion, and passion you don't have testimonial. Without hero, you don't have anyone that anyone want emulate."" On surface, Games seemed offer all drama that make lucrative endorsement contract. Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking his head springboard, then coming back win two gold medal? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, her two-inch fingernail raking air she won 100-meter sprint? But these two, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won women's heptathalon and long jump, may find it more difficult previous year turn gold medal gold bank. The fact is, say many marketer, Olympic gold ha lost much it commercial luster. ""I don't think it's big money it used be,"" say Michael Goldberg National Media Group Inc., New York sports-marketing firm that represents Ms. Retton. ""It used be kind knee-jerk reaction do ad campaign Olympic athlete. It just doesn't happen anymore."" Certainly, this year's winning Olympians will have no trouble securing contract specialized sports-equipment outfitter and speaking invitation obscure trade group. But major, high-paying endorsement -- such those soft-drink company and fast-food outlet -- just don't seem be surfacing, least not yet. Earlier this year, sport marketer estimated that gold medal won Summer Games could earn personable athlete more $1 million endorsement. Now, marketer say, these medalist will be lucky pull $100,000 $500,000 year. Advertisers can reel litany reason why these Olympics aren't igniting much spark. For one thing, they suffer comparison 1984 Summer Games, so exciting because they were held Los Angeles and because, absence boycotting Soviet-bloc country, Americans won 83 gold medal. The 1988 Games, contrast, were broadcast halfway world, and Soviets trounced Americans, 55 gold medal 36. What's more, marketer say, this year's drug scandal cast pall Games, especially incident involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who lost his gold medal testing positive steroid. NBC's TV coverage also get it share blame. Marketers say it wa so bland and skipped so frequently one event another that there wa little chance excitement build. The constant commercial interruption, which led rating that were much lower expected, didn't help, either. During most Games, ""there wa enough continuous TV coverage so that, much soap opera, it wa possible get involved life and competition,"" say Leigh Steinberg, attorney ice-skater Brian Boitano, gold medalist 1988 Winter Games. But not this summer, he say. Recent change Olympic rule, meanwhile, have led glut Olympians search endorsement deal. Before 1984 Games, most Olympic athlete weren't allowed make commercial unless they gave their amateur status. Now, they can appear many ad they want, income must go trust fund training expense. ""Every year, more and more Olympic people are out there wanting do commercial -- basically, everybody is available,"" say Daisy Sinclair, vice president ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As result, while once ""aura"" surrounded Olympian, now ""the bloom is off."" Companies also are becoming more sophisticated their approach celebrity endorsement. Increasingly cost conscious, they will no longer hook Olympian just because company president like athlete's sport. And year paying big buck Olympic star only see them fade obscurity, company have finally gotten hint that Olympian fame is most fleeting variety. ""If you think your phone will ring hook if (you win) gold medal, it isn't going happen anymore,"" say Stephen Disson, senior vice president marketing ProServ Inc., Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies now know that ""six month now there will be other hero other sporting events"" them consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude Olympics is becoming typical. It us sport star it commercial Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds ha no plan call any 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer use athlete who are public eye regular basis, football and basketball players,"" say Charles Miesmer, agency's executive creative director. ""People Michael Jordan have 10-plus year their sport career, all row, so I don't have worry public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And don't look any 1988's winner start showing Wheaties box, either. General Mills Inc., which ha featured Ms. Retton and decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner it Wheaties box past, say it look three quality endorser: career achievement, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishment. A spokeswoman say that none this year's crop meet all three criterion. So far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee ha had most visible endorsement. Even Olympics began, she had made commercial Primatene mist and 7-Up. And, according her agent, Pearl Hodge World Class Management, she is now ""in process"" signing McDonald's Corp., work behalf it effort aid underprivileged child. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take endorsement lead. Advertisers say her good look and fashion flare, she is attracting more interest any other medal winner. (The sprinter's manager couldn't be reached comment.) Another Olympian endorsement potential is swimmer Matt Biondi, who won five gold medal. Mr. Biondi ha already signed swim-wear contract Arena USA Inc., and Parkes Brittain, his agent Advantage International Inc., say his client ""will definitely be high-income ring, highest you can name."" Then there is Mr. Louganis. Since winning two gold medal 1984 Summer Olympics, diver ha had little luck major endorsement. And few marketing executive say that his second sweep diving event may not his potential. ""When most advertiser are looking male hero, word 'macho' trail very closely,"" say Marty Blackman Blackman & Raber, sports-marketing firm New York. ""I don't find Louganis macho guy."" Still, other marketing professional say that Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery smashing his head ha secured diver's future. His manager, Jim Babbitt, won't comment any contract offer. He will say, however, that his client ha ""done just fine. He isn't unhappy. He dive perform; he doesn't dive dollars."" ---Winning EndorsementsThere is only one former Olympian top sport endorser last year.ATHLETE: Arnold Palmer (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Hertz, PaineWebber, Pennzoil, United Airlines, GTE, Toro, Loft Seed Co., Sears, Pro Group, Robert Bruce, Westin HotelsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $8 millionATHLETE: Jack Nicklaus (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Bostonian Shoe Co., Hart Schaffner & Marx, Optique Du Monde, Pine Hosiery Mills, WarnacoESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Boris Becker (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Coca-Cola, Deutsche Bank, Polaroid, UNICEFESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Greg Norman (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Reebok, Spalding, Epson Computers, Hertz, Qantas Airlines, Daikyo Group, Swan Lager & Castlemaine, Akubia HatsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4.5 millionATHLETE: Michael Jordan (Basketball, 1984 Olympian)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Nike, Wilson, Excelsior, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Johnson Products, Ohio ArtESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4 millionATHLETE: Ivan Lendl (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Gleneagles Country Club, Avis, Seiko, Adidas, Bow Brand StringsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: John Madden (Former football coach)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Ace Hardware, Miller Lite, Ramada, Exxon, Canon, GreyhoundESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: Jim McMahon (Football)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Taco Bell, Kraft Foods, Ebel Watches, Honda, Adidas, LJN Toys, Revo SunglassesESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: Dennis Conner (Yachting)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Rayban, Sperry Topsider, Wrigley's, Disney, Lacoste, Pepsi-ColaESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Chris Evert (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Lipton Iced Tea, Wilson Converse, Ellesse, Polo Club Boca Raton, Rolex, Evert Active Life Skin Care, Marchon Sunwear EllesseESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Martina Navratilova (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Lufthansa Airlines, Vuarnet, DHL, Sugar-Free Jello, Aspen Club, RKO Video, World Tennis MagazineESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Jackie Stewart (Retired race car driver)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Ford, Goodyear, USF&G, Rolex, Gleneagles, American Express, British Telecom, ICCIESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionSource: Sports Marketing NewsletterDebi Thomas' dream Olympic goldturned disappointment Saturday East Germany's Katarina Wittwon her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian ElizabethManley took home silver crowd cheering countrymen.It's over.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.

They all oughtto be eliminated, retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque Centerfor Defense Information said Thursday. I don't know what more ittakes get people recognize this ancient technology is nolonger appropriate warships.But Navy defended 16-inch gun, mightiest use onany ocean, explosion killed 47 sailor Wednesday aboardthe battleship Iowa while turret crew loaded gunpowder targetpractice.This gun . remains finest naval gun world. It wasthe pinnacle gun design art, and it is still front-linesystem, said Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander Iowa untillast May.The main criticism is that big gun requires gunpowder packedin silk bag fire 16-inch-diameter shell it 62-foot-longbarrel. It work breech-loaded gun that roared theCivil War: A shell is placed barrel and then charged withgunpowder separate package.In Iowa's case, 660 pound powder six 110-pound bag is needed fire projectile weighing 2,700 pound aspeed 2,500 foot second. An electric spark ignites thepowder.The extremely flammable silk is supposed burn away theburst, some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gas canbuild barrel. Air pressurized 3,000 pound squareinch can be blown breech clear away debris guardagainst blowback, which happens when powder ignites beforethe breech is closed.In newer gun, powder is packed metal container. Missiles,the backbone modern Navy's attack capability, haveintegrated propellantsCapt. James Bush Center Defense Information, aprivate think tank critical Pentagon policy, said Iowaexplosion could have been caused smoldering debris, blowbackor mishap handling powder.It wasn't unexpected. It wasn't surprise. This is dangeroustechnology. It's archaic, Bush said. These are only gun inthe Navy that still used bagged powder.The Navy said Thursday that none gun Iowa turrethad been fired explosion took place.The Navy also Thursday placed moratorium firing bigguns, found only Iowa and it three sister battleship, theNew Jersey, Wisconsin and Missouri.In larger sense, critic say battleship themselves, oncethe mainstay gunboat diplomacy, have outlived their purpose.Despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, battlewagon arevulnerable submarine and missile attack. The 20-mile range ofthe 16-inch gun is almost worthless era when missile can befired much greater distances.We can do almost anything missile and do it better,Bush said.Battleships reached their heyday World War I and wereintended fight other ships.The Iowa, first launched 1942, wa first entireclass US. battlewagon built conquer Japan.It supported Marine amphibious landing and shelled shoretargets, aircraft carrier emerged Navy's top weaponbecause naval battle were waged ship ever seeing eachother. The Iowa also fought Korea.The Iowa and three sister warship were ordered out mothballsin Reagan administration's military buildup six year ago. Theywere upgraded Tomahawk cruise missile, 20mm gun and Harpoonmissiles.One battleship, New Jersey, bombarded Syrian andDruze position Lebanon part US. peacekeeping role in1983. But 16-inch gun missed their target, which theNavy blamed unreliable powder World War II.There wa no military need return these ship activeduty, said CDI's LaRocque. Their only military utility isto bombard Third World country, and era gunboat diplomacyis over.The scarred battleship USS Iowa made asomber return Sunday it home port, where 3,000 familymembers and friend crew welcomed loved one who escaped anexplosion that killed 47 sailors.Sailors white black arm band lined rail thehuge vessel docked Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 5:41 p.m.,just one minute later Navy official had estimated.

This timethey realized it.Glen Ellis, Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000residents Charleston and three surrounding county headedfor shelters.Tens thousand more got their car and headed upInterstate 26 Columbia.Mayor John Bourne North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related death, credited people heeding thewarnings.It wa bad, it could have been lot worse, he said.You've just got say nice thing people.Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news storm-wearyCharlestonians: late Saturday tropic were quiet no otherstorms brewing.There's nothing worry out there, he said.This historic city ha survived theravages earthquake, battle and storm it storied300-year-history, it faced perhaps it greatest test all inHurricane Hugo.The storm, packing wind 135 mph, raged CharlestonThursday night.This is dangerous, killer hurricane, like which fewpeople who have lived all their life Charleston haveexperienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.Hugo wa first major hurricane strike Charleston sinceHurricane Gracie came ashore 70 mile south 1959.The seaside community ha suffered many disaster, bothnatural and man-made.The worst recent decade wa 1938 when tornado torethrough city, killing 32 people, injuring hundred and causingan estimated $2 million property damage.Charleston, city pastel-colored antebellum structure liningquaint street and alleyway, is where Civil War began 1861.The city ha survived shot and shell two war and anynumber smaller hurricane, politely referred Charlestoniansof refinement September gales.But worst natural disaster beset city occurred thehot night Aug. 31, 1886, when ground rumbled what somefolks thought wa prelude Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake wa felt far away Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 Richter scale ground motion, theearthquake claimed estimated 110 life, destroyed 102 buildingsand tossed most city's 14,000 chimney streets.In recent year, city ha attracted million visitorsannually who tour it historic building and visit it nearby finesand beaches.Charleston ha received international acclaim home SpoletoFestival U.S.A., founded composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike refer Spoleto world's most comprehensive artsfestival.Supercomputers, satellite and expertise ofseveral hurricane forecaster predicted destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty time fleethe South Carolina coast.But hurricane tracking remains uncertain science.Forecasters National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path Charleston, S.C.All world's knowledge meteorological condition andforecasting change those condition is embodied thosemodels, said Thomas Pyke, head National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.Pinpointing exact point Hugo's landfall wa difficult, butforecasters said Friday that landfall wa predicted time forevacuation.Overall, I think tracking model gave u very good ideawhere Hugo would be so official South Carolina could act atimely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem Hugo wa predicting theintensity storm, which wa upgraded Category 4 hurricanejust hour it slammed Charleston.It is very difficult predict change intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer model that, McAdie said.We really need improve our forecasting ability strength.The hurricane specialist were surprised last-minuteincrease wind speed, which wa reported them Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who ha tracked hurricane 35years, said that couple decade ago, only forecasting toolswere report aircraft or ships.We had no radar or satellite then, so needle say ourforecasts were le accurate, Clark said.In late 1960s, weather service began using satellite toobtain global weather picture. Information satellite isused improve accuracy large-scale model thattelevision viewer see every night.Using information satellite, supercomputer theNational Meteorological Center Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where tracking model constantly change toaccount current weather condition and position thehurricane.To determine track storm, forecaster analyzesupercomputer prediction, satellite data, history similarstorms and current path hurricane.Then they make educated guess landfall.Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel MassachussettsInstitute Technology criticizes current forecasting system.Congress and American people are suffering thecollective delusion that our data problem have been solved bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give pretty picture, he said, not enoughinformation wind and temperature that affect ahurricane's path.Most information actually used predict hurricanescomes flying airplane hurricane, and they do verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say accuracy satellite picture is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have remember that those model used are only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately job theforecaster predict storm's path.Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday thousand coastal resident insoutheastern state grabbed what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.This is disaster staring u right eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. said his City Hall command post Charleston,where hurricane downed power line, snapped tree and causedutility transformer explode.All we can do now is pray and hope all precaution we havetaken have been sufficient, Riley said Hugo's eye bore onthe city. I just hope and pray we can get this anyloss life.By midnight, 119 mph wind were reported Charleston.

Phone and electric service commandpost wa knocked out.Hurricane-force wind first hit coast 9:15 pm. EDT, andabout three hour later eye storm passed Isle ofPalms just east Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director theNational Hurricane Center Coral Gables, Fla.The eye wa 10 mile and top wind were still 135mph.Hugo wa expected turn gradually north, causing severeflooding it moved East Coast. The storm posed 19 percentchance hitting New York City and 16 percent chance hittingBoston Sunday night, hurricane center said.As Hugo neared coast, road Hilton Head Myrtle Beach,200 mile north, were nearly empty, were boarded-up resorttowns themselves. Power line and tree were downed some spotsand water flooded road. Stop light and neon light were knockedout Myrtle Beach.One eyewitness said `It's light show,' said AmyGarrison, reporter WKZQ AM-FM Myrtle Beach.In Charleston, hurricane littered street tin roofs,palmetto frond and chunk bark.

Riley orderedresidents one-story home evacuate.Hospitals stockpiled supply, discharging any patient wellenough go and moving hospital inland make room foremergency patient, official said.About 12,000 people had checked 83 shelter stateas Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,a spokesman Emergency Operations Center Columbia, 220miles northwest here.We tried close door people are sneaking sidedoors, said Elaine Skelton, registered nurse working theConway High School shelter Myrtle Beach. We tried postguards door, people were still coming in.American Red Cross relief effort were buckling numberof evacuee, said Brian Ruberry, spokesman Savannah, Ga., whoappealed help.Right now Red Cross is sheltering ten thousand ofpeople all Eastern seaboard. This course is sametime that we're sheltering 25,000 people Puerto Rico and theother Caribbean islands.We're beginning feel squeeze. Our resource are verytight. Right now Hugo is shaping be one our biggest reliefoperations decade.At midnight, center Hugo wa latitude 32.7 degreesnorth and longitude 79.9 degree west, forecaster said. Thehurricane's speed had picked 22 mph 20 mph earlier.Near it center, Hugo's muscle reached wind 135 mph, from125 mph earlier day and 105 mph day before. North andSouth Carolina can expect tornado linked Hugo next twodays, according hurricane center.The coastal area could expect hurricane force wind 10 12hours once eye come ashore, official said. A hurricane warningwas effect Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.By late afternoon, Hugo wa upgraded category 4 hurricane onthe Saffir-Simpson scale strength, second mightiest category,which indicated it could cause extreme damage.It strengthened more we thought it would, Sheets said,adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding it moved theAppalachians.The timing landfall wa critical because storm'stidal surge, dome water 10 15 foot high that would feed anormal 5-foot high tide that peak 2 a.m.On top that will be wave, Sheets said earlier, and inmany place barrier island building will be swept cleanoff.Amid uproar live coverage themajor network and score other medium organization, NationalHurricane Center forecaster went their business monitoringHurricane Hugo.The whole system look chaotic, it work, said BobSheets, center's director.On one side large room dominated U-shaped bank ofmonitoring equipment were forecaster, making meticulouscalculations where deadly hurricane will strike andgetting emergency operation going those areas.On other side were medium pack reporter, cameraoperators and technician, jockeying second Sheets' time andtidbits his expertise.In center wa Sheets himself. Surrounded camera, wiresand two dozen journalist pad and telephone, ubiquitousred-headed meteorologist ha appeared television all week next toa large satellite monitor showing colorful image Hurricane Hugo.During prime news time, competing technician and cameraman shoutand make rude hand gesture people get out their shot ofSheets.At his back, casually dressed forecaster who have been working12-hour day tracked storm computer and satellites.We obviously don't this and could probably do betterjob, everyone know now because medium, said hurricanespecialist Max Mayfield. In Caribbean, we were not so certainthe word got out. But we know Carolinas have been evacuated.When hurricane warning go effect, It's $50 millionstatement, said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring cost ofemergency preparation and evacuation plan that must be implementedwhen warning is posted.If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that storm wa outthere, he said. Before hurricane warning system wasestablished, storm Hugo's power would have cost thousand oflives. But early today, day warning and proper evacuationprocedures, there were no immediate report death despitewidespread damage Charleston and other coastal area SouthCarolina.I think that we make difference far human livesare concerned, Cline said.After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and other forecaster began towind hectic pace they had maintained lastseveral day. But, he warned, hurricane center still isfollowing three other weather system that have moved theAtlantic United States and Africa, and another storm inthe Pacific.I hate say we're breathing sigh relief because peopleare getting clobbered death, meteorologist Mark Zimmer said asthe storm pounded Charleston, SC. But we've done all we can.Damage Hurricane Hugo, which stormed Carolinas and Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings several insurer. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net loss related Hugo reduce pretax earnings $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG ha told them that it must cover first $35 million loss and that it reinsurance agreement will cover bulk remaining damage. AIG insured property Puerto Rico, eastern Caribbean Islands and coastal region Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based St. Paul, Minn, said pretax cost Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount take consideration what St. Paul expects recover it reinsurance contract, company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected disclose Hugo's likely impact it earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, insurance industry analyst Shearson Lehman Hutton New York, estimate that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced 50 cent and 65 cent share after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% 40% his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said it State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimate claim payment Hugo will exceed $400 million South Carolina alone, far surpassing company's record payout single disaster. When damage North Carolina and Virginia are added, company said, payment will exceed $500 million. It said that is more three time previous record $165 million set Hurricane Alicia, which hit Houston-Galveston, Texas, area 1983.The greenhouse effect may breed bigger anddeadlier hurricane future, storm 50 percent strongerthan Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, somemeteorologists say.Hugo blasted eastern Caribbean and Carolinas 135 mphwinds this week, killing least 41 people.Just Hugo struck US. coast, it pressure wa measuredat 940 millibar. That made it 12 strongest hurricanesthis century hit United States, National HurricaneCenter's Miles Lawrence said today.Gilbert, whose wind reached 180 mph, tore Caribbean lastyear, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage. It wa mostpowerful hurricane ever recorded.Gilbert seems be upper limit hurricane withcurrent ocean temperature, said Kerry Emanuel meteorologydepartment Massachusetts Institute Technology.But if sea warm up, say 3 6 degree Fahrenheit, thewind speed might be 25 percent higher which mean destructiveforce would be more 50 percent higher, he said.Stephen Schneider, deputy director National Center forAtmospheric Research Denver, said his research suggests thewarming trend is already here.Schneider, expert greenhouse effect and author newbook Global Warming, said six 10 hottest year thelast 100 occurred 1980s.He project that 1990s will be hotter.Hugo demonstrated effect warm Atlantic water when itswinds jumped 105 mph 135 mph it passed GulfStream hitting East Coast, Schneider said.You'll get worse hurricane if Caribbean is warmer, hesaid. And I think there are better-than-even odds that you willhave stronger hurricanes.Emanuel said if ocean temperature climb, moderate hurricanesof future could grow Gilbert's strength and future Gilbertswill be stronger.Gilbert wa so strong that Bob Sheets, director nationalhurricane center, said forecaster may have use intensityscale 1-6 future, instead current 1-5, fivethe highest.The computer model Schneider us show that worst-casescenario, next 100 year world's temperature could jumpby 10 degree if carbon dioxide and methane gas which bothcontribute greenhouse effect continue pour theatmosphere unchecked.It is possible that though world whole heat up,the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler. But he said that isunlikley.That's not what model are showing, Schneider said. Andthat's another reason I'd slow global warming.

Satellites, computers, and reconnaissance planes helped forecasters monitor Hugo's progress. Insurance claims broke records. The greenhouse effect could raise future storms' destructive power by 50%.","Category 4 Hurricane Hugo did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean on Sep 17, 1989, and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo. Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.",Hurricane Hugo Could Have Been Deadlier. Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.",,,,

42,d075b,"The expensive practice using ballooncatheters force open heart artery immediately heartattacks, now routinely done many large hospital, is unnecessaryand should be abandoned, according major study released Tuesday.The study found that if heart attack victim quickly receiveclot-dissolving drug, they don't need extra step thecommon balloon procedure, known angioplasty.Some expert said result are good news, because they meanthat most heart attack patient can be treated communityhospitals, where angioplasty is not available.The study also ha important financial message. Its authorsestimated that if angioplasty wa widely adopted heartattacks, it could raise nation's annual medical bill $704million.This trial ha settled one most important question inmodern-day cardiology, commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy theUniversity Washington, Seattle.The study is phase 2 Thrombolysis Miocardial InfarctionTrial, or TIMI-II, directed Dr. Eugene Braunwald Brigham andWomen's Hospital Boston.The first phase study showed that giving people aclot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA,immediately heart attack dramatically improved their chancesof survival.The latest study, presented annual meeting AmericanHeart Association, wa intended see whether people betterstill if doctor tried clear away any remaining blockage aftergiving TPA.At 50 hospital United States, doctor randomlyassigned 1,636 patient get angioplasty two day theirheart attack if test showed there wa any chance they mightbenefit. Sixty percent them actually underwent procedure,which temporarily inflates balloon dangerously narrowed heartarteries squeeze them open.A comparison group 1,626 also got TPA. But they were notconsidered angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain orabnormal exercise test their recovery.After 42 day, 11 percent those angioplasty group haddied or suffered further heart attack, 10 percent thosein comparison group.A year treatment, there wa no difference survival.About 93 percent group were still alive.There doe not appear be any additional benefit fromangioplasty, Braunwald saidDr. Thomas J. Ryan Boston University Medical Center commented,We have answer this trial very important question ofhealth care delivery.While small hospital can give clot-dissolving drug heartattack patient, most them do not have sophisticated labswhere angioplasty is performed.If study had found that immediate angioplasty improvessurvival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty lab wouldneed be established and more doctor trained give theprocedure.The watch word is watchful waiting see if patient needangioplasty. This ultimately make it possible patient betreated community hospital and be transfered terciary carecenters if angioplasty is needed, said Dr. Howard Morgan,immediate president heart association.Heart attack occur when clot block artery that feed theheart muscle. The purpose TPA and similar drug is dissolvethese clot muscle dy. To be effective, drug mustbe given four hour start heart attacksymptoms.Experts say that only 20 percent heart attack victimsare considered be candidate drug. Many people delaygoing hospital permanent damage occurs. In others, thetreatment may be considered too dangerous because recent surgeryor history strokes.Balloon angioplasty is also widely used treat people withclogged heart artery who have not suffered heart attack. Thelatest study not question usefulness this kind ofangioplasty.Deaths heart and blood vesseldisease dropped 24 percent decade, it remains byfar nation's biggest killer, taking life every 32 second, theAmerican Heart Association said Sunday.The good news is that we continue see improvement thedeath rate biggest killer our population, said Dr.Bernadine Healy Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is presidentof heart association.Those trend are dramatic and don't seem be reversing, shesaid. The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1million Americans year, and we've got long way go.The association released statistic it annual forum forscience writers.Experts attribute decline death rate combination ofhealthier living habit, including fewer cigarette and better food,and improved medical treatment.The public ought appreciate progress that ha been madein heart disease 20 year, said Dr. Myron L.Weisfeldt Johns Hopkins University. It's almost unbelievable.There is almost no form heart disease that we can't approachwithout meaningful treatment.However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect heartassociation, also cautioned that much work remains, inimproving care and encouraging people take better care theirhealth.I believe we can prevent least 50 percent ischemicheart disease United States year 2000 if we stopsmoking, get cholesterol treated if it's 220, and identify andtreat hypertension, he said.Ischemic heart disease is clogging blood vessel that feedthe heart. It underlies most heart attack, single most lethalheart ailment.Association figure indicated that 1986 most recent yearfor which there are statistic estimated 978,500 Americans diedfrom heart attack, stroke and other disease heart andblood vessel. Cancer, No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.Between 1976 and 1986, death rate all form ofcardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It declined 28 percent forheart attack and 40 percent strokes.The association's figure show that more one fourAmericans suffers some form cardiovascular disease, and almosthalf those eventually die it.About 60 percent heart attack death occur thevictim reach hospital. Studies show that half allheart attack victim wait more two hour getting anemergency room.Weisfeldt said major health goal is getting people go thehospital three or four hour first sign heartattacks. During this period, there is still time give them drugsto dissolve blood clot that are causing their heart attacks.This treatment can life and reduce disability heartattacks.Other major goal, he said, include finding way improve theeffectiveness angioplasty, technique that us balloon openclogged heart artery, and finding surgical and medical techniquesto identify and protect people risk cardiac arrest.The heart association estimate that cardiovascular disease willcost $88.2 billion this year medical expense and lost wages.Among other statistic released association:The most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure,which affect 60 million Americans.About 200,000 death cardiovascular disease eachyear occur people age 65.There were 1,418 heart transplant 1987, almost nine time asmany 1983.About 2.5 million Americans have angina, chest painresulting clogged heart artery. About 300,000 new case occurannually.As many 1.5 million Americans will have heart attack thisyear.A drug that eas heart's workload cancut risk new cardiac attack and death 20 percent inpeople recovering heart attack, according major studyreleased Thursday.The study, conducted Denmark, found that drug Verapamil,known calcium channel blocker, wa effective 1{ yearsafter heart attack. Calcium blocker are several class ofmedicines commonly prescribed relieve high blood pressure.This is first trial that indicates that calcium blockermay be beneficial acute myocardial infarction, or heartattack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine University Florida.Several other study calcium blocker, including one largeUS. study published last year, failed find any benefit fromusing medicine heart attacks.According Danish study, Verapamil is effectiveas another variety blood pressure medicine known betablockers protecting people heart attacks.While calcium blocker may not replace beta blocker heartattacks, researcher said these drug still should have rolein treatment.We feel it is important have alternative. Many patient donot tolerate beta blocker, said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard ofCentral County Hospital Hillerod, Denmark, co-author thestudy.Beta blocker are generally not recommended people withasthma and emphysema. This mean drug cannot be given tocigarette smoker, who are frequent victim heart attacks.In study, conducted 20 community hospital, doctorscompared 897 patient who got Verapamil heart attack with878 people who took placebos.After 18 month followup, there were 146 death or recurringheart attack Verapamil patient, compared 180 inpeople who got dummy medication.We wanted see if effect would be observed withVerapamil, said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen Copenhagen MunicipalHospital.If it had effect, it should be seen first 12 18months, because there is big increase mortality myocardialinfarction this period, he said. Then it level off. That'swhat we demonstrated. It worked.The researcher believe that reducing amount workneeded heart sustain circulation, calcium blockerslowered chance ischemia, episode which heart's ownmuscle is deprived oxygen.They said they were unsure why earlier study failed showany benefit calcium blocker heart attack. However,they noted that some study enrolled patient who were also takingbeta blocker. And this might have obscured any benefit fromcalcium blockers.The result were presented meeting American Collegeof Cardiology. Among other research described meeting:Dr. James H. Chesebro Mayo Clinic said five-year studyfound that aspirin doe not stop continued buildup existingblockages artery feeding heart, although it maymodestly protect development new deposit. However,like other study, this one found that aspirin signficantly cutthe risk heart attacksDr. Eugene Braunwald Harvard Medical School said nextphase large study clot-dissolving drug will see whateffect they have unstable angina. This is condition whichpeople suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered workor stress. Until now, drug have been used only treat heartattacks.An intestinal operation lower cholesterolof heart attack patient reduced their risk another heartattack or death heart disease, researcher said today.The surgery, called partial ileal bypass, ha one significantdrawback: It cause chronic diarrhea that persists years.In operation, doctor change route smallintestine so one-third it is bypassed. This reduces theamount cholesterol that is absorbed bloodstream.The $52 million, 17-year study wa conducted people who hadalready suffered heart attack. The approach lengthened livesof people who had very mild heart attack not those moresevere heart damage.During average 10 year follow up, death rate amongsurgery patient who had sustained minimal heart damage wa 24percent. In comparison group intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percentDr. Henry Buchwald University Minnesota, who directedthe study, said surgery should be considered withcholesterol-lowering drug possible standard treatment.It ha role management patient highcholesterol who have had heart attack, Buchwald said. It iseminently logical extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, patient high cholesterol who have not hada heart attack.Besides diarrhea, those who undergo surgery are somewhatmore prone have kidney stone, gallstone and intestinalobstructions.The study wa conducted Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published today's NewEngland Journal Medicine.Despite wide acceptance cholesterol lowering, doubt remainabout whether it actually help people live longer if they alreadyhave healthy heart. Although latest study wa conductedexclusively people who had suffered heart attack, Buchwald saidhe belief research should settle that question.It offer strongest justification marked lipid(cholesterol) ineervention that ha ever been offered, Buchwaldsaid. It is very powerful study and should, certainpeople who will never be satisfied, end cholesterolcontroversy.In study, 421 people who recovered heart attacksunderwent surgery, while comparison group 417 people weretreated diet alone. At start study, their averagecholesterol level were 251. The surgery lowered people'scholesterol 23 percent.The overall risk dying heart disease or sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack wa reduced 35 percent thesurgical patient healthiest heart. The surgical patientsalso required le half many coronary bypass operationsbecause clogged heart arteries.New treatment that stop heart attack itstracks may help victim get out hospital more quicklythan ever before, perhaps three day their attack, astudy published today concludes.Doctors University Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effect sending few carefully selected heart patient homeearly. They found that these people had no unusual complications,got back work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.It wa extraordinarily safe strategy, said Dr. Eric J.Topol, study's director. There were no problem anyserious events.Topol said early discharge were made possible two recentmedical advance tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, andangioplasty.When given quickly heart attack, TPA can dissolve clotsin heart's artery and minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar result opening clogged artery withtiny balloons.The report represents latest steady three-decade trendof sending heart attack patient home hospital evershorter stays.However, study New England Journal Medicine saidmore research is needed finding are widely adopted.In 1950s, doctor recommended that patient stay inbed one two month heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffered uncomplicated heart attack in1955, he spent seven week recovering hospital.However, doctor learned that long inactivity more harm thangood. Patients got out shape, developed blood clot and becamedemoralized.In 1960s, stay wa shortened three week and the1970s two week. Now, doctor typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalized seven 10 days.In their paper, doctor determined that 80 507 heartattack patient studied were healthy enough be considered forearly discharge. None them had irregular heart beat, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill test showed no sign heart attackdamage.Forty patient were sent home three day, while reststayed seven 10 day. After six month followup, none haddied, and number medical problem group wa similar.However, people early discharge group were able returnto work two week sooner others, and their medicalbills were significantly lower $12,546 $17,868.The researcher estimated that if 15 percent all heart attackpatients were discharged three day, annual saving wouldbe least $280 million.In accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, deputyeditor journal, cautioned that study wa not largeenough spot complication that might result reducinghospital stays.This single study, he wrote, is not sufficient justifysweeping change current management practice all patientswho may first appear have uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors should be cautious prescribing aspirin preventer heart attack more research support it value, Food and Drug Administration said. Taking aspirin prevent heart attack may increase some people's chance dying other thing, especially hemorrhagic stroke, agency said commentary today's Journal American Medical Association. The FDA persuaded aspirin maker March refrain promoting aspirin preventer first heart attack, least now. A study published January indicated aspirin every other day reduced risk nonfatal, first heart attack 47% 11,000 male doctor five year, compared 11,000 who took non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tends promote bleeding reducing ability blood platelet help form clot. Heart attack occur when clot form artery nourishing heart and choke it blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risk people who already have clotting problem, or those who have high blood pressure, which put them increased risk hemorrhagic stroke, FDA commentary said. Strokes are result brain damage caused bleeding brain or blood clots; hemorrhagic stroke are those caused bleeding. The FDA commentary pointed 10 hemorrhagic stroke recorded 11,000 subject taking aspirin recent study, compared two such stroke 11,000 subject taking substitute. Overall death rate two group were same, though aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate wa much lower. There were 104 nonfatal heart attack aspirin user and 189 comparison group. ""Physicians, will, time, be forced make their professional judgment aspirin use basis incomplete information,"" said FDA commentary, co-written agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree them completely,"" said Dr. Julie Buring, Harvard University researcher who participated aspirin study. She added telephone interview yesterday that extension study is way, and researcher expect report FDA late fall. The commentary noted British study, also released January, 5,000 male physician that found that aspirin failed protect heart attack, and that it wa associated 2 1/2-fold increase disabling strokes.A drug used treat patient complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attack infour out five heart patient, according study published intoday's edition New England Journal Medicine.Surprisingly, however, study found that drug, diltiazem,increases chance subsequent heart attack patient whosehearts pump abnormally, expert said.Even so, result may trigger increase use thedrug, which is now primarily used treat angina, doctor said.The drug wa tested 38 hospital United States andCanada patient who had recently suffered heart attack, saidDr. Arthur Moss, clinical professor medicine Universityof Rochester and principal investigator study.The result suggest drug may be quite effective indecreasing likelihood second heart attack majorityof patient, Moss said. But study also surprisingly suggeststhat patient who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be givendiltiazem because drug increase chance subsequentheart attack.We now know when prescribe this drug and when not to,Moss said. That's what this study wa all about.Diltiazem is calcium entry blocker, newest class drugsto be introduced fight heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blocker are other type commonly prescribed doctors.The study involved 2,466 heart attack patient, who were giveneither 240 milligram diltiazem day or placebo. Patientswere recruited 1983 1986 and followed 12 52 months.Overall, drug only decreased additional heart attack 11percent, which wa not statistically significant, Moss said.But patient who had normal or near-normal heart pumpfunction 1,909 patient or 80 percent total group diltiazem decreased chance another heart attack 25percent, Moss said.In patient whose heart had pumping problem, drug not onlydidn't help, it increased chance heart attack 25percentDr. John Schroeder, cardiologist and professor StanfordUniversity, said he wa surprised that drug increased thechance heart attack any group and that overall result werenot higher.But bottom line is that this is first study showthat diltiazem can be effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean that more patient will be routinely put this drug ona long-term basisDr. George Beller, cardiologist and professor theUniversity Virginia, said he wa also somewhat surprised aboutthe increase heart attack group suffering pulmonarycongestion.This is one first report that seems identifythat, he said.Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blocker were introducedin decade, Beller said, and research how effectivethey are various application is it early stages.Nitrates have been used more 50 year, and betablockers were developed 1960s.Aspirin sale jumped 41 percent few weeksearlier this year, not because rash headaches.A study more 22,000 male doctor had shown that taking asingle aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk half.The study wa one series recent report showing thefirst time that doctor are able not only treat heart attack also prevent them.In most recent report, doctor found that one aspirin tabletand single dose clot-dissolving drug given 24 hourscan dramatically cut risk second fatal heart attack.Without treatment, patient had 13 percent chance dyingfrom second heart attack five week, researchersfound. With treatment, figure dropped 8 percent.The real discovery is that treatment patient is going toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, say Richard Peto ofOxford University, one study's authors.Heart disease is nation's leading cause death, far.The National Center Health Statistics report that 762,820Americans died heart disease 1987.To put it another way: Of 2,127,000 American who died thatyear, more one three died heart disease. (This doe notinclude those who died blood-vessel disease, such strokes.)The drug most responsible recent success preventingheart attack are new clot-dissolvers and that old standby,aspirin.The usual cause heart attack is blockage coronaryarteries, which supply heart muscle oxygen-rich blood. Theblockage arises buildup fat, cholesterol and clottedblood.Clot-dissolvers break clot, thus restoring blood flow.Aspirin interferes aspect clotting process, helping toprevent clot formation first place.The limited sale clot-dissolving drug UnitedStates show that many doctor are still not using them, despitetheir proven success. But that is beginning change.Some doctor predict that not-too-distant future thesedrugs will be judged so safe that they will be administeredroutinely paramedic ambulance suspected heart attackvictims reach hospital.We have know how respond quickly, and we have havethe courage use these drug absence definitivediagnosis, say Dr. Burton Sobel Washington University St.Louis, pioneer testing clot-dissolvers.The most important thing we can do is teach patient inadvance value early treatment, he says.While most public attention ha focused this new ability toprevent heart attack, researcher have also made importantprogress speeding recovery patient who survive heartattacks.Researchers University Michigan recently determinedthat some heart attack victim can be released hospital assoon three day their heart attack. Most heart attacksvictims are kept hospital least seven 10 days.The patient given early discharge were able return worktwo week sooner study group. After six months,not one death wa recorded early-discharge group. Theresearchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent heart attacksvictims could be safely discharged three days.In July, Stanford University doctor found that worker who wentback their job seven week their heart attack didat least well worker who went back more typicalconvalescence 10 or 11 weeks.All these advance come time when public health expertsare increasingly emphasizing role good health and goodnutrition lowering heart disease risk.Early next year, American Heart Association seal approvalwill begin appearing food that are low fat and cholesteroland therefore can help reduce heart disease riskUS. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop July issued his firstreport nutrition, calling Americans lower theirconsumption fat and eat more vegetable, fruit, fish,poultry and whole grains.The report ha been likened first Surgeon Generals reporton smoking, issued 1964, which focused public attention onsmoking's hazard. Koop's recommendation largely echo those theAmerican Heart Association, they should help carry messageto many more people.Progress research heart disease is making clear that theheart attack is no longer mysterious killer that strike withoutwarning and cannot be defended against.Much can be done prevent heart attack, great improvementsare being made treatment, and recovery is faster everbefore.The use clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save25,000 life year United States, doctor say.These result, say Dr. Peter Sleight Oxford University,will change medical practice worldwide.A natural substance called transforming growthfactor beta appears be able limit damage cardiac cellsfollowing heart attack, according study published thejournal Science.In study Jefferson Medical College Philadelphia, agroup laboratory rat induced have heart attack suffered 50percent le cell damage injection transforming growthfactor beta rat that not receive TGF beta.TGF beta is growth factor that opposes some bad guysfollowing heart attack, said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, professor atJefferson.Lefer said his research team simulated heart attack 24 ratsby partially blocking key artery their hearts.In 12 rat, researcher injected placebo. In theother 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.For those who received TGF beta, said Lefer, damagefrom attack wa much le severe. There wa 50 percentless injury TGF beta it.The extent heart cell damage wa determined measuring theamount creatine kinase heart tissue attack.Hearts damaged when blood supply is interrupted, heartattack, tend lose creatine kinase, said Lefer. Thus, bymeasuring loss this substance, researcher coulddetermine amount heart damage.Lefer said TGF beta seems block action othersubstances, such tumor necrosis factor, that can cause bloodvessels narrow heart attack. Narrowed blood vesselscarry le oxygen-rich blood cell and this cause additionalinjury heart attack.TGF beta is normally present heart cell, studypublished Science said that it is missing rat heart cellsdamaged simulated heart attack.Though TGF beta is produced naturally body, Lefer saidhis research team used substance produced artificially byGenentech, California biotechnology firm.Lefer said his team is now conducting additional study withTGF beta and that any experimental treatment human heart attackvictims substance is least year away.Jefferson Medical College, where study wa done, is part ofThomas Jefferson University Philadelphia.Science, which published study, is journal theAmerican Association Advancement Science.The experiment also hinted that blood and urine test,which measure activity blood protein called renin,might suggest new ""risk factor"" heart attack. Abouthalf 1.5 million Americans who suffer heart attackeach year don't have known risk factor heartdisease, such high cholesterol level, cigarette smoking,obesity and high blood pressure. It is unknown whatdistinguishes these seemingly healthy people those whodon't suffer heart attacks.The blood and urine test is already being done manycommercial laboratory medical condition other thanheart attack risk, said John H. Laragh CardiovascularCenter Cornell University and New York Hospital. ""In ourhands, it cost $40 and other lab it may cost thepatient $40 $80,"" he said. Dr. Laragh pioneered theresearch underlying use test, which wa developed byhis wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey. The test, which isn'tpatented, is available kit form laboratories.The blood portion test determines whether thekidneys are releasing renin blood stream and howactive chemical is. The release renin is firststep rapid chemical chain reaction that raise bloodpressure. The urine portion test tell how much saltis bloodstream. A high concentration salt theblood also raise pressure.The test is based fact that if saltconcentration blood rise, tending boost bloodpressure, activity renin normally drop offsetthe effect salt.The new experiment wa designed test theory put forthby Dr. Laragh and his colleague that activity therenin blood foretells possible heart attack. Thetheory ha provoked sometimes furious controversy almost20 years.The Cornell cardiologist ha argued that many peoplewith high blood pressure activity renin theblood is much higher is warranted amount saltin blood. Such ""high renin"" people are high risk ofa heart attack. On other hand, other patient withhigh blood pressure, activity renin is much lowerthan is warranted degree salt blood. These""low renin"" people are low risk heart attack, Dr.Laragh ha maintained.In experiment, blood and urine sample were obtainedat New York City office and factory 1,717 worke ","AP881115-0113,AP890115-0014,AP900322-0112,AP901003-0006,AP880428-0041,WSJ880603-0129,AP880818-0088,AP880829-0222,AP900705-0149,WSJ910418-0105",,,,,New medical advances reduce the number of heart attacks nationwide.,"The chances of having a heart attack, the number one killer in the United States, have decreased significantly in the last decade. Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

It just ha todo probability earthquake this area, Allen said.He noted that 1988 report, titled Probabilities LargeEarthquakes Occurring California San Andreas Fault,presented information that wa already widely known amongscientists. Allen said this information should have alertedofficials take preventive steps.Frank Baldwin US. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center saidthe quake's magnitude wa 6.9 Richter scale. It wa centeredin Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 mile south San Francico.The Richter scale is measure ground motion recorded onseismographs. A reading 6 can cause severe damage. A quake 7magnitude, major earthquake, is capable widespread heavydamage.Initial report indicated widespread damage Tuesday'squake, especially affecting highway and old masonry buildings.It's not earthquake this size this area is acalamitous event. It's something we should therefore be readyfor, Allen said.The damage Bay area occurred same kind ofstructures heavily damaged 1987 Whittier quake LosAngeles area, which registered 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.I think we'll learn lot engineering point viewfrom this earthquake, he said. What will be important is seehow modern structure behaved.Allen said many same kind older structure thatappeared have been damaged San Francisco also exist theLos Angeles region. In addition, some roadway andoverpasses area have roughly same kind constructionas Bay Bridge.In some area Southern California, there is higherprobability major quake occurring. The highest, USGS says,is central California town Parkfield, where there is 90percent probability magnitude 6 earthquake year 2018.Ever 1906 earthquake devastated SanFrancisco, many scientist have believed next big one wouldstrike Los Angeles end mighty San Andreas Fault.But study recent year have reminded Bay Area that italso faced another seismic disaster, and those study became areality Tuesday when quake measuring 6.9 Richter scalerocked Bay area.A 1985 paper Geophysical Research Letters predicted a6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time portion SanAndreas Fault that stretch 50 mile Palo Alto southwardthrough Santa Cruz Mountains and San Juan Bautista.The quake wa centered San Andreas segment described inthe article, Tom Heaton, scientist charge U.S.Geological Survey office Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yetwhether it broke all or part 50-mile segment.The epicenter quake wa 8 mile northeast SantaCruz and 75 mile south San Francisco.The 1985 study, Columbia University geology professorChristopher Scholz, wa several that produced conflictingestimates likelihood and size quake that finallyhappened Tuesday.These study gave various interpretation how much stressinside Earth wa released great San Francisco earthquakeof 1906, which had magnitude 8.3 and killed least2,500 people.The bigger quake, more stress it relief, and thus thelonger it take same size quake happen again.Scholz pointed evidence that 1906 quake didn't relieve asmuch stress Santa Cruz Mountains other scientistsbelieved. That suggested bigger quake might happen SanFrancisco Bay area sooner some believed.Others disagreed. Faced conflicting estimate, theGeological Survey issued July 1988 report that it saidrepresented consensus debate.The report said 50-mile segment had 20 percent likelihoodof producing magnitude-7 quake 30 year. It said thesouthernmost 20 mile that segment had 30 percent chance ofgenerating magnitude-6.5 quake 30 years.Tuesday's jolt wa centered those southernmost 20 milesof fault segment.Clearly, scientist had identified this segment aparticularly hazardous one, Heaton said.

48,d078b,"Spike Lee may have been wearing aGeorgetown University cap and sweatshirt, he got far warmerreception Syracuse University student he fromAcademy Award voters.In lecture and question-and-answer session Monday, Leeshrugged academy's icy treatment his latest movie, Dothe Right Thing, and blamed it generational politics.The 1989 film, widely hailed critic, received only twoAcademy Award nomination, and isn't being considered bestpicture or best director.The academy's membership consists mainly old people, the32-year-old Lee said. He said they were lot more comfortablewith black chauffeur `Driving Miss Daisy' theangry character his film.I still feel we made best film year, he said.Asked if racism might have been involved academynominations, Lee replied, Racism's involved everything.Despite cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse student welcomed himas one their own.He's African-American, one first one make it (asa producer and director), and he's addressing issue andconcerns affecting our community, Syracuse senior Deron Harrissaid. That's why we're so proud him.What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, CaryGrant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have common? Theyhave never won Academy Awards their individual achievements.Such flagrant omission are cited critic evidenceof unfairness Hollywood's highest prize. Oscar's 60-yearhistory is filled example film world's highestachievers being overlooked Academy Motion Picture Artsand Sciences.The latest casualty are director James L. Brooks, whose movieBroadcast News wa nominated though he wasn't, and Spielbergwho wa left out cold his Empire Sun.Although Broadcast News won seven major nominations,including best picture and three acting category, Brooks wasstrangely overlooked Academy's directing branch.Since no movie ha ever won best picture Oscar itsdirector least being nominated, chance once-favoredBroadcast News be big winner award ceremony onApril 11 have been significantly reduced.Brooks better 1984 when his Terms Endearment tookthe lion's share Oscars, including best picture and director.Spielberg's Empire Sun won six nomination this year,none them major and none director. Two year ago, TheColor Purple received 11 nomination not him director.The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.I'm floored this, Spielberg said receiving his DGAaward. This is last thing I expected happen. . If someof you are making statement thank God I thank you that.Why Spielberg slight? Some observer cite fact that only257 director nominate Academy Awards, and many areveterans who might not look kindly young man whose film arethe biggest moneymaker history (Jaws, E.T., Raidersof Lost Ark).The Academy appeared make amends last year presentingSpielberg Irving Thalberg award consistently highquality production. There wa no mention fact thatSpielberg is primarily director, not producer.The Thalberg award ha come handy acknowledge giant whowere overlooked individual award. The recipient have includedCecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergmanand Mervyn Leroy.The honorary award ha also proved useful salve Academy'sconscience. Charlie Chaplin received one first AcademyAwards his creation The Circus and again 44thawards incalculable effect he ha had making motionpictures art form this century.Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch,Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, MauriceChevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G.Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are whohave received honorary awards.Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected win anAcademy Award. I'd have blacken my teeth first, he quipped,alluding Academy's fondness actor who portray bum anddowntrodden characters.Alfred Hitchcock also had lighthearted comment why hefailed win Oscar: I suppose it wa matter ofcarelessness.The overlooking classic film and industry's mosttalented filmmaker ha provided historian cause dispute.For example, Citizen Kane, which customarily place No. 1 onpolls greatest American film, wa nominated 1941 forbest picture (there were 10 nominee those days), OrsonWelles' performance, direction and co-scripting HermanMankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, art direction, sound,music and editing.The only Oscar Citizen Kane wa script. HowGreen Was My Valley wa named best picture.Billy Wilder's classic comedy, Some Like It Hot, failed tobe nominated best picture, Chaplin's Modern Times,Hawks' Red River and Woody Allen's Manhattan.Oh, well. Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line SomeLike It Hot: Nobody's perfect.The Oscar statuette, one mostrecognizable image entertainment world, ha no copyrightprotection, federal judge ha ruled.The small Academy Award statue is part public domain,US. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said ruling releasedThursday.The decision wa setback Academy Motion PictureArts and Sciences, which had sued Chicago-based manufacturer ofan employee-incentive trophy similar Oscar.Academy President Karl Malden said ruling come shockto me. The academy said it would appeal.The academy claimed that Star Award, trophy look-alikemade Creative House Promotions, violated copyright law, dilutedthe academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.The Star Award depicted naked, muscular male much theOscar, just two inch shorter and holding star instead asword. It had gold finish similar Oscar, and stood acircular gold cap mounted cylindrical base.Although Waters acknowledged that Creative House trophy isvery similar Oscar, he rejected all academy'slegal claim, saying that statuette became part publicdomain prior Jan. 1, 1978, effective date CopyrightAct 1976.The film industry's top award wa distributed firstceremony 1929 1941 c mark indicatinga copyright.The judge ruled, too, that Oscar not only wa honoraryaward also wa used promote film industry, and thereforedid not have limited purpose, required copyrightact.The academy noted that ruling applied only statuetteand that academy's trademark and service mark Oscarand Academy Award name and symbol are unaffected.We are surprised that court would base it decision onevents which occurred half century ago, overlooking themeticulous fashion which Academy ha protected integrityof it institutional symbol decade, Malden said astatement.Free enterprise ha collided AcademyAwards, and everybody's trying pick pieces.With Oscar statuette selling auction more $10,000and Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones,the National Academy Motion Picture Arts and Sciences isscrambling make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished byHollywood hucksterism.If you know infringement and fail object it, yourisk having your trademark become public domain, said Bruce Davis,the Academy's executive administrator, explaining lawsuitsthe organization ha filed protect it beloved hunk ofelectroplated pewter.But Academy's crusade crass commercialism,this year's award ceremony will feature new merchandisingwrinkle: Some 800 limousine delivering most famous star theOscar telecast will be equipped door-mounted cooler jammedwith Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.When limo door swing open front Shrine Auditoriumand celebrity tumble out, Coke logo will be display infront audience that includes million world.It seemed good marketing opportunity, said Coca-Colaspokesman Ira Gleser. The Academy approached our local bottler inLos Angeles and said we're going have lot thirsty people.But Academy embrace this new intrusion ofmerchandising, it ha lashed out else it considers ablemishing Oscar name.When MGM-UA, distributor Rain Man, published newspaperadvertisements touting film's Oscar nomination thenominations were announced, Academy issued harshstatement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble. After adsappeared, Rain Man collected nine nominations.We regard this serious matter, and we have communicatedour concern, said Richard Kahn, president Academy.For nearly 50 year, Academy ha maintained strict securityaround nomination and award winner. It also hasenvisoned statuette itself something icon.So auctioning Oscar ha greatly distressed Academy.The Collector's Book Store, local sponsor monthlyentertainment memorabilia auction, ha sold seven Oscars thepast year, including best picture trophy 1951's AnAmerican Paris ($15760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for1954's On Waterfront ($13,000) and black and whiteinterior decoration Oscar 1941's How Green Was My Valley($17,715).None were sold original recipients; heir or friend whohad later received trophy put them block.When Malcolm Willits, book store's owner, announced that hewould hold February auction 1957 best-picture trophy forAround World 80 Days, Academy said enough, initiatinga court action that, now, ha blocked any future trophy sales.The Academy insists that contract signed Oscar winnersmandates that they will not sell trophy first offeringthem Academy nominal fee.But now that word is out that these award are worth$10,000 $50000, people are reluctant sell them back theAcademy $10, Willits said.The Academy ha created something great value here. This isthe most famous award world most instantly recognizableaward. The Nobel Prize might be greater honor, people knowmore what Academy Award look like.And they're very limited, too. There's not too many themaround. . Twenty year ago, you wouldn't have movie poster inyour living room unless you were college student. Now, you can gointo Beverly Hills home and there's movie poster, and darnthing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.When Academy won court order temporarily blocking futureauctions, Willits decided sell his store. It seemed be thefinal straw. I don't lawsuit, he said. I'm getting olderand I'd write movie scripts.Yet Academy ha lost it most recent attempt itstrophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought againstthe Houston International Film Festival wa dismissed March 16 aCalifornia federal court.The Academy had claimed Lone Star Statuette, designed andbuilt Chicago's Creative House Promotions, wa practicallyidentical Oscar. The court found otherwise.The motion picture industry's most covetedaward, Oscar, wa created 60 year ago and 1,816 statuetteshave been produced so far.Weighing 8{ pound and standing 13{ inch tall, Oscar wascreated Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio art director Cedric Gibbons,who went win 11 trophies.Oscar, manufactured RS. Owens Co., Chicago, is made ofBritannia metal, copper plate, nickel plate and gold plate. From1942 1944, trophy wa made plaster, winner werelater presented real thing.According Academy Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,the only engraving mistake wa 1938 when best actor trophygiven Spencer Tracy Boy's Town read: Best Actor: DickTracy.The Academy hold all right statue and reservesthe right buy back Oscar someone take it pawnshop, said Academy spokesman Bob Werden.The most-nominated film wa All About Eve 1950. It got 14nominations. Ben-Hur 1959 wa most-awarded film 11,and Walt Disney wa most-awarded person 32.Oscar selection ha come scrutiny filmstudios go new length pull vote out Academy MotionPicture Arts and Sciences.And flood Oscar vote enticement free coffeemugs complimentary buffet dinner Academy member areacknowledging that some Oscar voting is done committee, inviolation rule.

A lot peopledon't know who candidate are. So they take look who'saround them and see what consensus is.As far election go, it's not bad. But I've never beenthrough election Argentina.Dan Lyle, who oversees Oscar balloting accountingfirm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee thatAcademy member have actually filled out their ballots.All we know is that properly numbered ballot ha beenreturned, he said. Members are honor system fill outthe ballot themselves.More 4,600 member were given ballot this year 61stAnnual Academy Awards, which will be telecast March 29 theShrine Auditorium Los Angeles. Academy member vote their areaof specialty. The Academy's actor branch, example, is onlygroup select nominee four acting categories.Since voting is done secretly member do not sign theirballots ballot's authenticity is ensured solely numericcontrol number, Lyle said. Ballots are invalidated only if there ismore one vote given category, and only vote thatspecific category are not tallied, he said.Nominations acting, directing, art direction and allspecialized category are handled select branch and committeescomposed Academy members.All voting member Academy can participate bestpicture nomination and may vote final award allcategories. Winners best documentary feature, best animatedshort film and best live-action short film are chosen only thosemembers who have seen all nominees.Academy constituent Julian Blaustein said that most hiscolleagues take voting very seriously. I don't vote (in acategory) if I'm not familiar picture that category. And I've never told someone vote film, when I'vedone some them.Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rule are perhaps being broken,speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman. Although you'reasked vote nomination five picture, I think lot ofpeople figure out that they have better chance if they just votefor their picture and leave other four blank, he said.Given tremendous impact Oscar nomination and Oscarvictory have film's fortune, it's not entirely surprising thata certain degree artifice might surround Oscars.The Last Emperor took $18.9 million, close half thefilm's gross, it won last year's best picture trophy. Morethan 70 percent revenue generated 1986's best picturePlatoon, came film wa nominated. On average, bestpicture award is worth $20 million these days.A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted studiotherefore, can be good investment. In case this year'sawards, flurry Academy-oriented newspaper advertisementsbanquets, complimentary gift and photo mailing tied five latereleases appears have been remarkably successful.This year, all best picture nominee and large majority oftop acting nominee came movie released December: TheAccidental Tourist, Dangerous Liaisons, Rain Man andWorking Girl were all released Dec. 16.While these five movie might be good, nearly completeexclusion film rest year ha highlighted thestudios' mastery Oscar marketing.I think Academy Awards are crap, said Terry Gilliam,director Brazil and current The Adventures BaronMunchausen.It's selling film is all it's about, he said. It'sone more way flogging some film. When `Brazil' got nominated (in1986), they asked me be member Academy. And I wouldn'tjoin. I just don't want be part that all.And least one prominent Academy member, director Carl Reiner,says that manipulation Oscar voter ha reached new depths.Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort bag vote forSigourney Weaver, best actress nominee Gorillas theMist, could lead him vote film.I have my house more color reproduction Sigourney Weaverand beautiful gorilla I need, Reiner said promotionalmaterial sent his home.

Walt Disney was the most-awarded person (32).","Director Spike Lee, speaking at Syracuse University Monday, shrugged off the treatment of his movie by Academy Award voters. Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories. The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers. In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.  Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting. On average a best picture award is worth about $20 million, but there is no guarantee that Academy members actually complete their own ballots.Millions watch the awards presentation. The last awards show took a long three plus hours. The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character. Though long, the 1989 ceremony will be favorably remembered for the spread of the awards. Ten movies split 17 awards. The Oscar, created in 1928, is one of the most recognizable symbols in the entertainment world and is not protected by copyright.

The openings cameafter years of negotiations which, in some cases, stipulated that McDonald's buy itssupplies locally.","The Big Mac debuted to mixed review as McDonald's opened restaurants in Korea,Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Large crowds stood in line for hours atopenings in Belgrade, Moscow, and Peking. Customers in Yugoslavia, the firstcommunist country to get a McDonald's, and China raved about the taste of the Big Mac.In Moscow, the Russians were less enthusiastic about its taste but gave a thumbs up tothe shakes. The openings came after long negotiations which, in most cases, sawMcDonald's contracting with local farmers for the beef, potatoes and other suppliesneeded for its restaurants.","McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets. After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.

The US. ambassador Bonn, Vernon A. Walters, earlier this month reaffirmed Washington's policy supporting German reunification based free, democratic election. But Mr. Walters caused stir predicting that reunion could occur relatively future. Emerging opposition uncompromising Communist rule East Germany ha raised question how long East Berlin's leader can resist democratic reform sweeping neighboring East Bloc country. Reforms Poland, Hungary and Soviet Union have magnified East Germany's Stalinist control. Fledgling protest group, and influential Protestant church, have begun pressing reform East Germany which, if allowed include free election, could eventually lead reunited Germany, according some Western expert. Dorothee Wilms, Bonn's cabinet minister inter-German affair, said interview newspaper Welt am Sonntag that recent poll show that 85% and 90% all West Germans favor reunifed Germany. ""The desire reunification, feeling togetherness, sense nationhood -- all this ha strongly increased recent years,"" Ms. Wilms told newspaper. ""The recent escape movement DDR make especially clear that people German state want live free amongst themselves,"" she said, cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight. The first step, she added, ""is reform process DDR."" Most West German government 1949 have paid only lip service reunification goal set preamble West Germany's constitution. Political reality have prevented topic becoming serious issue. Analysts say that four decade different system would make reunification difficult. Further, many West German worker worry that mass influx East Germans could threaten their job. Thousands East Germans have emigrated West Germany Austro-Hungarian border Budapest ignored East Berlin's protest and opened it border. Close 80,000 East German refugee have arrived West Germany so far this year, either legally or escaping, and total more 100,000 are expected December.

The territory is aboutone-third present-day Poland.East Germany and West Germany each separately ha recognized theborder, there ha been no official assurance that reunifiedGermany would also acknowledge border.One can only unite established border and withoutterritorial argument, said Skubiszewski.He also said German reunification is unlikely long WestGermany belongs NATO and East Germany Soviet-led WarsawPact military alliance.The Berlin villa where Nazi leadership metto implement final solution Europe's Jewishpopulation will be site World Jewish Congress conferenceon German reunification.The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that themeeting is scheduled May 8, 45th anniversary V-E Day.The world is expecting Jewish statement reunification,said Edgar Bronfman, president World Jewish Congress.I think that place where they decided `finalsolution' is right place have such meeting, and theanniversary victory Europe seems be right day.Some 100 member World Jewish Congress 70countries will attend conference villa WannseeBerlin, where Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and partyofficials adopted plan exterminate Jews.Jews have right state moral position Germanreunification and we will make moral statement.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.

In country where businesspractices are not overly genteel, this is tough combination achieve. Avast medium circus, meanwhile, is quick expose any flaws.Sam Walton, founder Wal-Mart chain discount supermarket who diedof cancer April, negotiated these pitfall much better most. When,in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, thepaparazzi descended obscure corner Arkansas, mainly occupied bychicken farmer, where Walton made his home. What they found wa happilymarried, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted atthe local Holiday Inn, and drove battered pick-up truck, twohub-caps. Folksy wa understatement.Since then, some aspect Wal-Mart's business - it anti-union policies,the impact it Dollars 40bn annual sale hundred Mom-and-Pop shop -have been subject critical scrutiny. So, extent, have lesswholesome adventure four Walton child. But no one ha ever beenable make Sam himself look bad. The worst that ha been said is that hewas rather dull.Walton is not dash anyone's illusion. Readers will either find hisautobiography lashed 'good ol common-sense and lot harmless, ifcharming, anecdote. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makesno excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring most you,' he writes onestage, 'but one my best item ever wa mattress pad called Bedmate . . .'A few snippet are more revealing character. There cannot be manybillionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - andhave gut include photograph which demonstrates point.Meanwhile, competitive energy which Sam Walton applied his businessis inescapable. In one many contribution friend and family, DonSoderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tell finding Sam oneSaturday morning his hand and knee local Kmart store, analysinghis rival's stock. And his wife, casual aside, note that when thecouple wa holiday Italy their luggage vanished while her husband wasoff similar scouting mission.But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhapscaptures entrepreneurial Walton spirit best. Explaining annualcontest which Wal-Mart executive choose one 'volume producing item' topromote, he recall time Sam (who won) selected minnow bucketsfor carrying bait. Glass wa more happily teamed apple juice. 'So Iwould go store, and get them take that minnow bucket . . .put ice it, ice juice and give away sample out his minnowbucket. I particularly it store I knew (Sam) wa going visit. Itdrove him crazy, and he got that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'But reader can't help feeling that cosy yarn tell only half thetruth. Sam Walton wa salesman core, and seems have packagedhimself all skill that he once applied selling gooey southernsweet called Moon Pies.For most part, this make engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.Occasionally, it just grate. 'I had bought bank Bentonville, aboutabout Dollars 300,000,' Walton remark, example, 'just little old bankwith only Dollars 3.5m deposit. But it helped me learn lot aboutfinancing things.' Oh, come Sam, is that whole story?The real truth, one suspect, come right end book - whenWalton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have writtenthis book'. Given pleading publisher - Doubleday paid Dollars4m manuscript - and rather natural desire have final say, hecan hardly be blamed agreeing write it. But these are unlikely becircumstances which make most critical self-analysis. At end ofthe day, Sam Walton's heritage is shopping mall, not bookstores.The store manager Wal-Mart thiscommunity outskirt Dallas tell story that give aninsight man considered responsible retailingphenomenon.Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when secretarytelephoned Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters inBentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton wa land nearbyairport and secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bringhim De Soto store.Paying unexpected call store is one way Walton ha kept inclose touch everyday goings-on. His example is followed byother Wal-Mart executive and most make point spending lot oftime field.Says Ed Nagy, district manager 9 store Dallasmetropolitan area, It's not `Uh-oh, someone's coming,'because they're always out.By all account, Sam Walton's personality permeates operationsthroughout company.Everyone, Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating OfficerDavid Glass hourly store worker, can readily quote thegospel according Sam, he is called.To paraphrase Sam's primary rule retailing, Rule No.1 isthe customer is always right. Rule No.2 say just case thecustomer's wrong, revert rule No.1.If principle sound old-fashioned and homespun, they arebecause that's way Sam is, people who know him say.He shuns limelight that his company's success ha shed himand ha decided refuse almost all press request interviews.He's happy chat folk his store, though.He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart associate thathospitality customer is crucial. He preaches it person or viahigh-tech satellite hookup his stores.Wal-Mart employee became known associate companyeffort prove it cared employee, partly thwart unionorganizing effort late 1960s.One most sensitive subject Walton is fortune he'samassed.A close associate say Sam would probably give anything notto be named Fortune magazine's list country's wealthiestpeople. The magazine ha estimated that his immediate family's stakein Wal-Mart stock is worth $6.8 billion.Sam Walton is more interested his backhand he is hisbank account, say Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.Samuel Moore Walton turn 71 March 29. He wa born inKingfisher, Okla., and grew son farm-mortgage banker.He graduated University Missouri economicsdegree 1940 and joined JC. Penney Co. management trainee inDes Moines, Iowa. After serving three year Army, he went toArkansas and opened Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventuallybecoming company's biggest franchisee.The seed Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and hisbrother James L., or Bud, opened first Wal-Mart Discount City in1962.

He spends le time office sincehanding most responsiblities David Glass. Sam is stillchairman board.Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourishwithout Sam. The answer is emphatic yes because, he say, Wehave great people. The Walton family will always be involved, headds.Commenting future, Glass says: We'll be judged whatwe produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done won'tmatter.Wal-Mart founder Sam Waltonpitched help check-out clerk his store this FloridaPanhandle city when electronic glitch shut cashregisters.The 71-year-old Walton, considered be one world'srichest people, grabbed note pad Tuesday evening and startedhand-writing merchandise price customer so their bill couldbe tallied calculator quickly.People began recognizing him and coming and greeting him,said store manager Paul Sively.

Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pagesMany people might be said be personification American Dream;few are better qualified that title Sam Walton.Walton is character it would be difficult invent, all-American boywho became one world's most successful businessmen. The church-goingson farmer born 1918 Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded storechain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly hisdeath 1992, became world's biggest retailer.His company, Wal-Mart, made sale Dollars 55bn last year, and afterWalton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four childrenheld them second-largest fortune world - Dollars 23.5bn.What is most startling Wal-Mart is speed it growth. AlthoughWalton built small chain Ben Franklin variety store franchise from1945, it wa not 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discountstore.At time it incorporation 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlet withsales Dollars 44m - not enough earn place trade journal DiscountMerchandiser's list 71 biggest US discount retailer. Ten yearslater, 330 store and Dollars 1.6bn sale, it wa only 33rd-biggestretailer US. Its turnover wa only 9 cent that SearsRoebuck, biggest, and 11 cent K mart, second-biggest. Withinanother 10 year, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.Apart Walton's autobiography completed shortly his deathhowever, published material company is curiously scarce. This bookattempts fill gap, provide 'scholarly account' rise ofWal-Mart, setting it wider context US retailing, and explaininghow it wa achieved.One strength author identify is Wal-Mart's ability copy and adaptfrom other retailers.Sam Walton not invent discount retailing. Rather, he realised threatdiscounting posed his variety store business and studied depthmany US's leading discounter early 1960s, including Ann andHope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.Walton learned them all, wa unique taking his discount storesinto small town few thousand people, where shopper used travellinglong distance were delighted have cut-price store nearby sellingeverything they needed.Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness technology. As early the1950s, Walton realised he wa wasting too much time travelling and bought asmall aircraft pilot store himself - something he continued todo end his life.Sometimes, Walton wa more reluctant invest technology, and had bepersuaded colleague introduce computer, and scanning check-outs -long most retailer had recognised their importance - and investDollars 20m internal satellite communication system. This technologyhelped Wal-Mart build one most efficient distribution system anyretailer. But perhaps most fundamental reason it success, booksuggests, ha been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive managementstructure.Regional vice-presidents based group headquarters BentonvilleArkansas, rather costly regional office, are despatched everyMonday aircraft their region, spend week visiting store, workingwith staff and manager, and return day-long merchandising meetingevery Friday.They discus result, problem and suggestion week 7.30ammeeting Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district manager torelate result. District manager hold conference call theirstore manager, and day is out, content meeting havebeen communicated all store department heads.The system mean employee can make suggestion vice-presidents one weekand, if idea is accepted Saturday meeting, see it implementationbegin week.Even world's most successful retailer make mistake, however. One wasWalton's decision stand chairman and chief executive's rolein 1974 favour Ronald Mayer, only return role 1976after finding he wa incapable letting go rein. Another wasWal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big forgigantist America.Then there wa Walton's rash promise do 'hula dance' Wall Street ifWal-Mart achieved 8 cent pre-tax profit margin 1984. It did, andhe did.The book also cover well debate whether Wal-Mart's impact theeconomies small US town wa positive or negative.If there are criticism, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quitecaptures sheer excitement working world's fastest-growingretailer. Moreover, it make little attempt predict whether Wal-Mart cancontinue it growth, and conquer rest world way itconquered US.But this is well-researched and accessible account one man's success inbuilding his American dream.He's ranked richest man thenation leading business magazine, folk Bentonville,a town 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.He's just part community, said Curt Loyd, executivedirector Bentonville Chamber Commerce. He's neatperson. He call Bentonville home, and that is special us.Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Martstores trumpeting his personal financial holding, is againshunning publicity his third consecutive ranking theworld's top billionaire. According Forbes magazine's July 24edition, Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, upfrom it 1988 estimate $6.5 billion.He is unavailable, said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle thesilver-haired founder nation's third-largest retail chain,based Bentonville, 150 mile northwest Little Rock.Shinkle said he received 10 call reporter Mondaymorning, when Forbes list appeared newspaper. Shinkle saidnews coverage Walton set press frenzy forcomments him. But 71-year-old businessman declined tocomment.He feel any attention Sam Walton is individual andhe prefers attention Sam Walton (the founder of) company,Shinkle said.He very seldom schedule interview his feeling. It justputs him position he doesn't want be.But Walton occasionally offer peek that reveal personalmodesty. Just 1987 stock market crash, which Walton'sfamily-owned chunk Wal-Mart stock lost million value, hequipped response question news conference anothertopic that it wa only paper. Walton then changed subject.Walton wa first listed Forbes nation's richest man inOctober 1985. Three year ago, Forbes also began listing world'swealthiest people. Walton made that listing richest Americanevery year since. This year he rank third, two Japanesebusinessmen.Shinkle said Walton stay busy visiting many more than1,400 store operated company he started singlefive-and-dime Rogers more two decade ago. He is out theoffice four day week, spokesman said.He spends most his time talking associate andcustomers, Shinkle said, and he always come back manyideas them.Wal-Mart call it sale help associate instead employees.When Walton first made Forbes list richest Americans,recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, call came infrom all billionaire Ozarks.They wanted know stock and company, saidSimpson, who work Stephens Inc. You'd think that he'd beliving New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas. But now peoplejust accept it.When it come out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,'Simpson said.

It ha branch inOrlando.The company's loss adjuster are area trying estimate losses.Their guess is that loss be faced all insurer may total more thanDollars 8bn.Not all damaged property area is insured and there have beenestimates that storm caused more Dollars 20bn damage.However, other insurer have estimated that loss could be low asDollars 1bn total.Mr Robertson said: 'No one know this time what exact loss is'.WHILE Hurricane Andrew wa wreaking havoc large part southernFlorida and Louisiana this week, grade two dollar crisis (on one-to-fourscale, four being most severe) wa blowing itself out end atumultuous few day US and world financial markets.On Wall Street, most damage currency storm wa inflicted aweek ago Friday and Monday, when bond yield jumped sharplyand Dow Jones industrial average plunged more 75 points.The flimsy wall erected hastily Federal Reserve and other bigcentral bank protect vulnerable dollar tidal wave sellingon foreign exchange market failed hold; and seller pouredthrough breached barricade, currency dropped DM140. This wasits lowest-ever point D-mark.The condition necessary dollar crisis had been building incurrency market some time. Interest rate differential US andGermany widened summer Fed eased, and Bundesbanktightened, their respective monetary policies.The failure US economy climb out recession any vigour wasalso making overseas investor increasingly unhappy holding thedollar.So, too, wa political hole President Bush had dug himself are-election battle that only year ago wa supposed be shoo-in theincumbent.Moreover, fact that almost every central bank worth it salt wa themarkets trying prop dollar served only convince foreignexchange dealer that currency wa heading one direction - down.While there were plenty reason dealer sell dollar, thelogic such strongly negative reaction bond and stock market wasless obviously compelling.There are two standard explanation why weak dollar prompt bond price tofall. The first is that it raise import price and, result, add toinflationary pressures.The second is that it make it hard Fed engineer another cut ininterest rate stimulate flagging recovery, and raise thepossibility that rate may actually have go protect currency.The first explanation is not particularly convincing - import account fornot much more 10 cent US gross domestic product, so higherimport price do not greatly effect overall price level, which is nowaround 3 cent and heading lower.The second explanation carry more weight. Although there is not muchchance, given present economic and political climate, that Fed willraise rate help dollar, there is little doubt that currency'sweakness make it extremely difficult Fed ease monetary policyagain.The fear that Fed may be done interest rate cut presenteconomic cycle wa also selling equity market.
