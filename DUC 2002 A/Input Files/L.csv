0,d116i,"Five astronaut boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reach of the universe for clue to the beginning of time. Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activity. Air Force forecaster said there wa a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 am. EDT. More than a half million gallon of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tank after midnight. The astronaut, wearing bright orange flight suit, climbed into the crew cabin just a dawn wa breaking over the Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomer a new set of eye and ear that we don't have, said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program. It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't say what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new thing. Discovery wa aiming for an altitude of 380 mile, the highest a shuttle ha ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in it proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, which journey into space next month with the Astro observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 mile from Discovery, only the second time both pad have been occupied; the first wa in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion. Hubble ha been waiting to take it place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problem and the Challenger accident. The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch wa scrubbed four minute before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle. The mood at the Kennedy Space Center wa considerably le festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundred of astronomer gathered with their family. The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space. Veteran spacewalker Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops. Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 mile away for two day until after it lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said it will release it first image an open star cluster in the constellation Carina a week after launch. In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million ha been spent on spare part, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time. NASA estimate it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space. During it 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomer with 10 time better resolution and 25 time more sensitivity than ground-based observatory. As a result, they will be able to study star and galaxy so distant their light ha been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion year. Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe wa created 15 billion year ago a believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxy, black hole and quasar. Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end. The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe wa created by a tremendous explosion. In addition to Hubble, Discovery carry a human skull filled with sensor to measure the space radiation that astronaut receive. It is the skull's third trip into space. The shuttle is to end it five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronaut returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 am. EDT Tuesday. We feel very confident that thing are going to go well this time, said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're going to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep trying until we do. That's kind of the name of the game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that the countdown wa proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect condition. The countdown got under way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be scrubbed four minute before liftoff April 10. The unit wa replaced with a new one, which test showed to be fine. Hopefully, we'll get the shuttle off the pad this time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance of favorable weather wa expected at launch time, with low cloud being the main concern, said the Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front from the north wa expected to pas through the area by Monday night. The outlook is considerably better for Wednesday and Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronaut arrived from Johnson Space Center in Houston early Sunday afternoon, the shuttle Columbia wa being transported to a launch pad 1.6 mile from Discovery. It is only the second time both shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center have been occupied simultaneously. The first time wa in January 1986; 16 day after Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand said he doe not believe the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast with his shuttle. NASA expects to launch Columbia with an astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier than May 16, one week later than planned because of Discovery's two-week delay. In some case, it could be a problem having shuttle on both launch pad, Brand said. In this particular case, everything's fitting together. NASA ha until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground. After that, all launch attempt must be halted for eight day so Hubble's battery can be recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen battery will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's electrical system until it two energy-collecting solar panel take over in space. Discovery's payload bay wa sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 mile, the highest a shuttle ha ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in it proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey through space, astronomer expect to look back to nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most perplexing mystery. Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble and thus provide additional target for the telescope. The $100 million observatory also will focus during Columbia's nine-day mission on Comet Austin, believed to be on it first trip through the solar system. Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled for launch in 1986, but were delayed by the Challenger accident. The Hubble Space Telescope wa awakened from it self-induced sleep today but it wa still without the use of it high-speed antenna, and it science instrument were on hold, unable to begin any observation. We are out of the `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineer controlling the telescope. He said the telescope wa running on a normal control-all mode, where it own computer and sensor guide where it is pointing. Discovery's astronaut, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observation of Earth and talked with ground-based reporter about their flight. Pilot Charles Bolden said he wa especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light year nearly to the birth of the universe. It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who ha never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It make little kids' eye light up. It make little kid want to learn how to add and subtract and study science. The telescope's big eye ha remained open, but Hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problem in linking the high-speed dish antenna with a relay satellite. The antenna are the primary link for relaying scientific data to the ground. Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorder in the telescope read telemetry signal from all it system and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antenna are working properly. We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, he said. Engineers are able to send command to the telescope via it secondary antenna but the communication system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed. We're putting the scientific instrument in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode, he said. Shortly after 6 am. EDT, controller at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of command that took the telescope out of it safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health. It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it wa supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problem, Olivier said Friday. This is not the time to do anything dumb. The telescope problem have put the flight center several day behind, but the five astronaut who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule. Landing is scheduled for 9:48 am. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controller were keeping a close watch on the weather. Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gust up to 29 mph. Mission rule dictate that headwind cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown. The shuttle carry enough supply to stay in orbit three day beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awakened the crew member at about 1:30 am. EDT today by playing the song, Cosmos. Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today, said Commander Loren Shriver. The song wa selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronaut were to finish up their experiment and photography today and pack for the trip home. They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporter at the Johnson Space Center. Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of test to make certain the shuttle's computer and control jet were ready for return to Earth. The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there wa trouble opening the aperture door. Mission specialist Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 mile above Earth. But that proved unnecessary when the door wa opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time. Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscope stopped working when the door opened, but engineer later got them back on line. The gyroscope were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verification at Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's system were set at conservative limit for the first operation and that caused many malfunction. There also were two communication outage totaling several hour. Hubble is designed with safe mode so it can be the master of it own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communication system is lost for extended period, Terry said. NASA had planned to release it first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problem. Scientific data will follow in a month or two. The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomer over it 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion year and possibly determine the age of the universe. The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion year ago in a cosmic explosion. Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation. He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away. After year of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope wa freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on it 15-year search for new world. Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wing unfurled. The first of NASA's great observatory is now on station at 330 nautical mile above the Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really looked great a we flew away from it, and we sure hope it doe good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later. The $1.5 billion telescope wa released at 3:38 pm. EDT a the shuttle entered it 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hour and one orbit later than planned. The shuttle then backed away. Thank you very much for the ride, said Mike Harrington, director of orbital verification at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialist Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel. That proved to be unnecessary. Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the way it did, Sullivan said. She and McCandless had trained for nearly five year to make such a rescue mission. The first solar array unreeled from it mast at midday Wednesday a the shuttle passed 380 statute mile, or 330 nautical mile, above South America's eastern coast. It started providing power to the telescope's battery, which otherwise had only eight hour of charge. Deployment of the starboard panel, however, wa more troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latch were first released, then moved about a fifth of it 39-foot length, and stopped again. A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way. Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 am. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high above the shuttle. Hubble wa taken off shuttle electrical power just before it wa lifted out of the cargo bay and wa operating on it own nickel-hydrogen battery. At one day, seven minute into the flight of Discovery, Hubble is now on it own internal power, Carr said. The game ha begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking. Worries that the telescope's instrument would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel wa stretched out. Television camera aboard Discovery showed the first array a it wa pulled from it reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope. Discovery wa 380 statute mile above Earth, 70 mile higher than any shuttle ha ever flown. The orbit wa dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere. Discovery's five astronaut were awed by the view. I'd like to pas on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure look far away today, Shriver said of Hawley. Astronomers have waited seven year for Hubble to take it place in space. The telescope originally wa scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problem and the Challenger explosion pushed it back. The mission wa delayed another two week when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minute before April 10's scheduled liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting Hubble out of this world and in search of others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Discovery wa following Hubble in case the door doe not open properly. If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would be tested Thursday for it ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened. We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said. The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of it five instrument. If all go well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects to release it first image from the telescope of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina on Tuesday. Data will follow in a month or two. Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying star and galaxy so distant their light ha been traveling to Earth for 14 billion year. They expect to determine precisely how and when the universe wa formed, currently estimated at 15 billion year ago. The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe wa expanding. He also wa responsible for helping to form the Big Bang theory of creation. Ground controller at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antenna on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hour to lock on. Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., a the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space wa solved. We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers had said all along they believed the antenna were working all right and that the problem wa in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communication satellite that act a a switchboard. In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beam to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degree to 10.8 degree. The telescope's low-gain antenna, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergency, were working well. Space shuttle Discovery wa 46 mile away, available to remedy certain problem. The outage wa not a problem for which space walker would have been summoned. The five astronaut were otherwise busy making picture of storm over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiment. Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspect of the telescope, said the first outage wa caused by human error and wa not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 am. EDT and lasted 45 minute to an hour, he said. The second failure occurred at 6:44 am. when controller attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antenna through the TDRS. This time it wa a pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman. It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it wa the cause. The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new world, wa released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronaut on an emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite. Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are a lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble had a good night while you were asleep. We appreciate the good word from everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuver, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 mile behind Hubble. The telescope really looked great a we flew away from it, and we sure hope it doe good work, Shriver said Wednesday. Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud of you. Scientists have hailed the Hubble NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft a the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eye nearly 400 year ago. Discovery and it five astronaut will follow the telescope while controller at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such a responding to directional command. The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. Data will follow in a month or two. If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronaut could perform a spacewalk to fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for it ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened. We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instrument. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay. One of the telescope's solar array unreeled from it mast a expected and started providing power to the telescope's battery, which otherwise had only eight hour of charge. But there wa trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge when the latch were released, and then moved about a fifth of it 39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt. By the final attempt, astronaut Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suit in the airlock, 30 minute away from taking tool in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown. The 8{-hour procedure wa performed 380 mile above Earth, 70 mile higher than any shuttle ha ever flown. The orbit wa dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting atmosphere. Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying star and galaxy so distant their light ha taken 14 billion year to reach Earth. They hope to determine how and when the universe wa formed, currently estimated at 15 billion year ago. The telescope originally wa scheduled for launch in 1983 but wa delayed by technical problem and the Challenger accident. Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven year late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time. Less than five hour after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent it first test radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheer erupted in Mission Control in Houston. As near a we can tell, everything look perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space. Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 mile above Earth higher by 70 mile than any previous shuttle. There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonder of creation with instrument that can look 14 billion year backward in time. Our window on the universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted a the Discovery rose off it seaside launch pad. It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many year, said NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's in it element and I'm delighted. The telescope wa supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problem and the Challenger accident delayed it deployment. It suffered a further delay two week ago when the countdown wa stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle. While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness. In it first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. On hand to watch the Discovery launching wa a contingent of scientist who have hailed the Hubble a the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eye nearly 400 year ago. Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he wa asked about the long delay in getting the telescope to it working station. Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?' said Truly, a former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matter that we do it right. The telescope is 43 foot long and 14 foot in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it fly free, it will receive electrical power for it six scientific instrument from two wing-like solar array that extend outward on each side. It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that the universe wa expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling. That gave support to the theory that a massive explosion the Big Bang created the universe 10 to 20 billion year ago. The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe? How big is it? The telescope ha two mirror, one 94.5 inch in diameter, the other 12 inch. Two of the instrument are camera, two are spectrometer and one is a photometer. In addition, the fine pointing system act a a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distance. On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and after a long checkout drop it overboard to orbit on it own. In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle. But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal battery until the solar panel are extended to receive light from the sun. Should the solar panel not deploy, mission specialist Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed in space suit, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the array manually. Discovery's launch wa not without it problem. With 31 second left in the countdown, the computer that run the final moment before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process. The problem wa overcome and the shuttle lifted off at 8:34 am. EDT, about three minute late. The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 am. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California. On the way uphill, a Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the shuttle's windshield wa splattered with several fleck of thing. He said the windshield wa streaked by the debris and that it also wa smeared when the spent booster rocket fell off during the climb to orbit. The astronaut also had problem with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thruster wa inoperative. Neither problem wa considered serious. The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carry an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once wa the world's most powerful telescope. It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contribution to astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday a she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope wa carried into orbit by Sullivan. After she brings the eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the observatory. It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group run the observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. The discovery made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave u a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe, McAfee said. We believe the Hubble Space Telescope will do the same thing. The Hooker Telescope wa the world's most powerful telescope from it construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope wa placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego. Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble wa the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement. This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxy existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy, the institute said. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the Hooker telescope to take thousand of photograph of faint galaxy, showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly. This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding, the institute said. Hubble's work helped convince scientist the universe wa created in a giant explosion, called the big bang, an estimated 15 billion year ago. The Hooker Telescope wa mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move. The institute hope to obtain fund to reopen it.

1,d113h,"INDIA suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed two block of flat in the centre of the city of Calcutta, killing at least 45 people and injuring score of others. Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two block of flat to collapse and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble. The identity of the bomber wa unknown but the explosion come just five day after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attack aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay. A militant Sikh group fighting for independence for the Indian state of Punjab ha claimed responsibility for the Bombay blast, but police are unconvinced, saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance with 'local criminals'. In what many interpreted a a reference to Pakistan, with whom India ha fought three war, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi that he suspected 'an international conspiracy.' Most of the estimated 125 people living in the Calcutta flat were in their bed when the blast occurred, setting fire to both building, according to official in the city's central control room. At least 45 people were dead on arrival at hospital, they said. Last Friday a series of car bomb exploded in Bombay in what the government described a a systematic attack on India's commercial heart. Among the target were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotel near the airport. The attack in Calcutta and Bombay are a severe setback to attempt to heal the wound created by recent intercommunal violence, which ha caused deep shock throughout India. More than 2,000 people died in riot, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealot on December 6. Some fear the wave of bomb attack is designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and undermine effort by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. Last night national and local state leader appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumour after the 'inhuman and criminal blast'. A ROW ha erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the security watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' book. The Sebi ha accused stockbroker of flouting the exchange's rule, including regulation on margin trading designed to limit the risk of member defaulting through excessive speculative investment. It ha also accused the exchange authority of failing to enforce rule and of poor administration. The stock exchange denied the allegation, saying they were 'baseless, made out of context and blown out of proportion.' The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market where, a measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, share have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320 point fall since the government's budget wa announced two week ago. Yesterday the index closed at 2330. Foreign investor, who are being wooed by India a a source of much-needed capital, will also be concerned at the latest allegation of poor management at the exchange. In one of it most damaging passage, the inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas, a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's governing body, avoided margin payment totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 408m). Mr Kothari said yesterday that most of the transaction covered by the report were off-exchange deal directly between financial institution for which margin payment were not required. Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive director, said BSE rule permitted such bilateral off-exchange transaction. Sebi also accused the exchange of mismanaging the administration of it building. This week's argument is only the latest in a series of dispute which began almost a soon a Sebi started operation a year ago. It wa established by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, a a crucial element in financial reform. Brokers claim the Sebi is heavy-handed and fails to understand their need. They say rule must be applied flexibly and many firm are extremely small and unable to carry the cost of extra regulation. But the finance minister is backing Sebi to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent budget speech. Finance ministry official believe loose regulation allow broker and others to dodge tax and also contributed to last year's security market scandal in which bank, including the UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost a combined gross total of Rs40bn. The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, wa rocked by two powerful bomb last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured. The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal. It ha had to compromise - trading ha been restricted to an hour a day, and dealing ha moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago. Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday and Tuesday. But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday, and the index came back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,40923. All this ha taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six week or so, ha had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expression of disappointment. Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed trader in the budget at the end of last month. He postponed corporate tax reform by a year, denying hope of a tax cut recommended by an expert group. He did reduce excise and import duty on a broad front, but left out the cement and steel sector, where share price had been boosted by pre-budget speculation. To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investor with their overseas counterpart in taxing short-term capital gain. He lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investor but for local investor it remained at 44.5 per cent. Taking the tax concession for granted, trader had driven up share price in February to make a kill later. Instead, the budget turned out to be a nightmare. While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duty would leave corporate profit ex-growth this year. The relative lack of financial concession meant that disappointed trader sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless a equity price plummeted to a 13-month low. Overseas investor fuelled the downtrend a they sold some half a million share of Reliance Industries, arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the market price of it Euro-issue of global depository receipt (GDRs). The opportunity arose after a change in Indian regulation which allows international investor to convert GDRs into the underlying stock. At the current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetched Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210. The BSE 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10, from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27. Share price rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance, ha continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday. Whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the ability of bull to maintain their momentum. They are hoping that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after 'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by international investor. The Indian stock market have been passing through a series of crisis since December, when activist of the Bhartiya Janta party pulled down the Babri mosque at Ayodhya, sparking off communal riot. Mr Mark Bulloch of Jardine Fleming take the domestic political situation in his stride. 'Nothing dramatic ha happened a far a foreign investor are concerned,' he say. 'They are appraising the political situation.' In the meantime, there is no compulsion for local investor to sell. In this, they are more fortunate than they were in previous year, when they were under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gain tax exemption before the financial year ended in March. The exemption ha been replaced by a flat 20 per cent tax this year which, according to dealer, put bull and bear on an even footing. THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troop into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bomb exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand. The device, mostly car bomb, appeared to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart. All exploded within 90 minute in the afternoon. Among the target were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotel near the airport. The identity of the bomber wa unknown, but the attack were a severe setback to India's attempt to heal the wound created by recent intercommunal violence, which ha caused deep shock throughout India. More than 2,000 people died in riot, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealot on December 6. The bomb appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine effort by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism. One of the target wa close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riot, in which most victim were Moslems. National and local state leader appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumour after the 'inhuman and criminal bomb blasts'. Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister of Maharashtra state, said all road into Bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert. He said: 'It is aimed at disrupting the economy and it appears a conscious effort because only Bombay seems to be the target.' Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi: 'We suspect an international conspiracy.' The Indian High Commission in London said the attack were 'part of the externally supported terrorism which ha targeted India for some time'. However, Indian official stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan, the country's arch-enemy. The bomb attack were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riot in which victim were mainly poor. At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park, hurling shard of glass across the floor and into the street. Some victim were crushed in the stampede to escape. Outside, burned body lay among litter from shattered building. MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar wa serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he wa showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosion which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1,200 injured. 'I'm lucky to be alive,' he said from his hospital bed. 'Who did this? Who can stop this happening again?' Across Bombay people were asking themselves the same question this weekend. They sensed there wa an enormous difference from the riot which scarred the city in December and again in January. Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatred stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya. The weapon used were mostly primitive - knife, club and petrol bottle. Friday's outrage, by contrast, bear the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timer, efficient organisation and money. The only comparable previous incident wa the assassination in 1991 of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorist. But that wa a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosion in Bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital. Bombay account for 35 per cent of India's export. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, described the blast a an attack on India's economy. The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the street of Bombay wa that those responsible must have been foreigner or had foreign help. But these suggestion were seen in Bombay a a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspect - Moslem extremist who might have taken revenge for the riot which hit India after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 in Bombay. If Moslems are found to have staged the attack, the Indian authority will certainly suspect that the operation wa supported from a Moslem country, notably Pakistan. The implication would be vast. Breaking diplomatic relation would be the minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road. Mr Rao chose his word carefully during his visit to Bombay: 'There is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country. I do not want to name anybody because it will have ramification within and outside the country.' There is no evidence linking the attack to Moslem extremist, let alone to Pakistan. Even if Moslem group are found to be responsible for the bombing, they could have been supplied from other Moslem country. India would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale. For the moment, such concern seem remote from the street on Bombay, where the atmosphere yesterday wa calm. Workmen were clearing away rubble at the blast site, including the blackened stock exchange building. Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them. At the Gymkhana Club and dozen of other sport ground, hundred of men and boy were playing cricket a they do every Sunday. Others were walking along the seafront by the arch of the Gateway of India. The stock exchange authority plan to re-start trading a soon a they can -probably today - using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last year. Businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injury and the damage caused to blasted building. They did not expect the same widespread disruption to production a occurred during the riot. Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troop to help patrol sensitive district. But much more should go to the people of Bombay, who, so far at least, have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bomber.

2,d120i,"THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalist ha surprised some people. It ha even been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter word to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleague, may do him good. With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image a a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction. What piffle. Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority of 23,015 at last year's general election wa converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Fifteen month too late, the voter of Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury. In reality, all politician, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public. In public, they have to be careful of what they say, so their utterance achieve a horrible mattness. But in private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their word become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really is a spectacle. To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith. Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know that. In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost it deposit, I wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching. To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler. No one could have eavesdropped. Their response were true to form. But I have left out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide state that 'the gratuitous use of expletive or obscenity is discouraged . . . Four-letter expletive will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review (Arts) pages.' I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is a puzzle. First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week? They were describing Europe's lunatic monetary policy and exchange rate arrangement. They did not pull their punch. I bet you went chalk-white. 'So why not walk the plank, John? You are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantness, let alone the cock-ups.' 'Are you sure?' the prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . how did it come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load of . . . let me put it to you - the economy, of course . . . I mean, wimpy guy like me. But I'm not giving in like that, like . . .' On and on it went. Then I rang John Smith. I told him I had been impressed with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reform (if he ever get elected), including a referendum on proportional representation. I said: 'You are starting to raise your game, John. Many people will have agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practice - especially their 'centralisation of power and the elimination of opposition'. But some of your critic still accuse you, John, of laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say to that?' 'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig wa Rab M'Graen, a clever, sturdy fellow, but then he wa sae fley'd by his showther gae a keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle. Likewise with political and constitutional reform, Michael, for by the L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, a lang's I dow]' After that, I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his view on Christchurch. But I couldn't raise the energy. Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film wa Being There. I entirely concur with their choice. In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, wa the plot: a man no one know anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rise without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency. Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiment in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power broker that he is a sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromide everyone seems to hear what they want to believe. He ha a deadly innocence. No wonder the Majors liked this film. John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's. If he did not see the similarity, that is still more revealing. Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener. In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few day ago, Major disclosed an unknown fact: his father wa once a farmer. Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'. (Well, it wa obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father wa a farmer. He lived on a small farm somewhere in Shropshire.' Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910. As Wheen pointed out, Major wa an unresponsive minus 33 year old at that time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire. This, of course, doe not mean that Major made everything up. Family folklore is a peculiar thing. Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a few month ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel industry, a part of his American tour. I recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city. A farmer for Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . . . a pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all thing to all people. If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point barely worth making. But it doe seem all of a piece with Major's approach to wider political issue. On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe. On the other he is free with insulting reference to the European Commission, whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics. There are those who will argue that this merely mean that Major is a typical democratic politician, that one who want to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituency of interest, not just one. But that ha not been true of Major's most recent Conservative predecessor. Margaret Thatcher wa notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too wa Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus politician'. No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his unsettled family background. His father, Tom Major-Ball, wa an itinerant figure, moving from place to place, trying his hand at any number of occupation, including the circus. No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with prevailing circumstance, no matter how fluctuating. The only problem is the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. Except in the movie. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by winning the general election. His honeymoon, after a very personal victory, wa short-lived and now he begin the second year of his hard-won term a a deeply unpopular leader who ha everything still to prove. The past 12 month have been hijacked by internal party difference over Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep recession which ha disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory supporter in business. Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretend that the last year ha been easy,' he also claimed that much had been achieved. The government's effort to secure a framework for long-term prosperity wa beginning to pay off. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, wa joined by 10 frontbench colleague in launching a counter-attack, involving a detailed and documented indictment of Mr Major's failure. He attacked the Tories for building 'a bonfire of pre-election commitments'. Tory allegiance in the business world have also been put under immense pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften a recession end. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, remained cautious but volunteered: 'If I were a betting man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery.' Mr Major can take little comfort from the conclusion, widespread among industrialist, that his greatest achievement in the past year ha been Britain's withdrawal from the ERM - something which he resisted and over which, in the end, he had no control. Most industrialist, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major a an individual, with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal quality and those of his predecessor. He still attracts gratitude for the election victory, which wa seen - despite subsequent problem for the economy - a the best result for business. But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he is seen a a weak leader, with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction. There is a general perception that, important though Britain's future place in Europe is, the prime minister ha been excessively preoccupied with community affair and associated internal party ruction, to the detriment of the domestic economy. Many industrialist are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting to reshape economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base. But the jury is out on whether the rhetoric will give way to effective action. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The first 12 month - election victory to an initial Maastricht defeat ----------------------------------------------------------------------- APRIL Wins election with 21 seat majority 'The country looked a Labour government in the eye and decided that it wa not after all Time for a Change' - Peter Jenkins, the late political commentator 'We have won tonight a magnificent victory, a victory many people thought beyond our grasp' - Major ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAY Best Conservative local election result for 13 year in England and Wales.

Major, 47, fell two vote short of winning a majority in voting among the 372 Coservative Party member of Parliament, but his two opponent quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed Major a the winner. Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11{ year in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday morning, and Major would then be called to lead the government. Major, the chancellor of the exchequer, emerged from his official residence at 11 Downing St. Tuesday night smiling and holding hand with his wife, Norma. Inside, Mrs. Thatcher, who came next door from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street residence, embraced Major. I am thrilled and delighted that John Major is to succeed me, the Iron Lady said in a statement released by aide. It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leader the Conservative Party ha ever had, Major said. Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general election, said Major, who will be the youngest British prime minister in this century. Major received 185 vote, two short of a majority. Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56. Hurd and Heseltine conceded within minute, and party official declared Major elected. The party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership challenge by Heseltine, who last week stopped Mrs. Thatcher short of victory in the first round of the leadership race. Mrs. Thatcher had not wanted to leave office, but she decided to resign last week after she wa unable to put down Heseltine's challenge. She said she resigned to let someone from the Cabinet stand against Heseltine. Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both joined the race, but before the vote her aide spread the word that she wa backing Major. The son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare recipient, Major personifies the value of self-reliance and hard work that Mrs. Thatcher had preached to the nation. His election climaxed a month of British politics-turned-upside down, and the Western world's longest-serving head of government wa driven from office by a revolt in party rank. Heading a government that wa trailing the opposition Labor Party in the poll and suffering a losing streak in local Parliamentary election, Mrs. Thatcher lost control of event after her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned on Nov. 1. Howe, the fourth Cabinet member to resign because of dispute over policy toward the European Community, shocked the House of Commons on Nov. 13 by calling Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital interest. The next day, Heseltine announced he would challenge her. Six day later, with Mrs. Thatcher at a 34-nation summit in Paris officially ending the Cold War, Heseltine polled enough vote to deny her re-election a leader. Two day later, she decided to resign after party leader told her she could not win. Heseltine, 57, said Major's election lay the basis for the unity of our party. Hurd said the party needed to unite, and John Major is the right leader for this task. Opposition leader derided Major's election a Thatcherism with a different face. The Conservatives' main rival, the socialist Labor Party, demanded a general election. John Major is a Thatcherette - that is how he sought election and that is how he got elected, said Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. It mean that the policy that brought the poll tax, recession, heavy mortgage and rising unemployment will go on. During his five-day campaign, Major had aaid he would review the poll tax, an unpopular local tax brought in by Mrs. Thatcher, but he gave no other hint of differing with her. While adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of Britain's involvement in Europe, he share her opposition to a single European currency and share her belief in tight restraint on government spending. However, he insisted over the weekend, I am not running a `Son of Thatcher.' I am running a myself, with my own priority and my own program. Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself a a future leader of the party. Tomorrow always dawn, he said, smiling after conceding defeat. Major wa elected to Parliament in 1979, wa appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year. He moved up quickly in the leadership race. By the weekend, opinion poll showed that Major wa nearly a highly regarded by the public a wa Heseltine, who ha been prominent for a decade. Major attracted support from figure on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friend insisted Major's own view were more liberal than many supposed. He described himself a conservative on economic issue but liberal on social issue.

In May local elections across Britain, however, the Conservatives loss 444 seats, and word circulated that Major was not up to the job.Major became leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister after his mentor, Margaret Thatcher resigned under pressure in 1990. Though he won the 1992 general election, the lingering recession and controversies involving European community issues splintered the Tories. He came to be viewed as a weak, vacillating leader, lacking political conviction.","In early May elections across Britain, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing 444 seats. One editorial claims some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major, and there is speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher when she resigned under pressure in November 1990. After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift. Major's comment while visiting America a month later that Iraqi troops might have to be ""forcibly removed"" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard-line on the Persian Gulf.Within a year of winning the general election, his popularity had plunged. In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015 the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats. Though Major's personal style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak leader, lacking vision and political conviction. Not even recent revelations that Major uses salty language can alter his wimp image.","John Major elected leader of Conservative Party, becomes next Prime Minister.","John Major emerged victorious in an election for leadership of the Conservative Party and became, at 47, Britain's youngest prime minister.

3,d117i,"Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel The Remains of the Day, judge announced Thursday. The prize is worth $32,000. Judges praised the novel, a love story about a butler's English vacation, a a cunningly structured and beautifully paced performance. Other finalist this year were Canadian Margaret Atwood for Cat's Eye, Irish author John Banville for Book of Evidence, Scotland's James Kelman for A Disaffection and English writer Sybille Bedford for Jigsaw and Rose Tremain for Restoration. After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in February when he wa threatened with death by Moslems who said his novel The Satanic Verses blasphemed their faith. Now that circumstance have changed, when perhaps it is inconvenient for many people to support his writing, I just felt it wa fitting that we should not turn our back on him, Ishiguro said. Rushdie life in England. Ishiguro, 39, arrived in England at age 6 and now life in south London. He writes in English. In announcing the winner, the judge said: `The Remains of the Day' render with humor and pathos a memorable character and explores the large, vexed theme of class, tradition and duty. It wa narrowly preferred but universally admired. Ishiguro wa a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his novel An Artist of the Floating World. The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business. After hour of heated delib-eration - under a system described a 'mad' by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg. The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with bookseller, who have damned all six book shortlisted for the prize a boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable. Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judge, acknowledged that Mr Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible. 'We had an extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after three hour of debate. Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she wa made extremely cross by the decision. 'It's just a drunken Scotsman railing against bureaucracy,' she said. 'My eye are stretched in disbelief. The voting system is completely mad. Kelman wa the least favourite of the three front runner. If it had been a short story it would have been fine.' Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observer, the most difficult work to have won the prize. In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some a a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: 'My culture and my language have the right to exist.' One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman is good, but not a good a he think he is.' The Booker prize ha, in it 26-year history, always provoked controversy. But this year's row have been of a particularly fine vintage. Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction. Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, wa attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for the award, Ms Claire Messud, wa in fact Mrs James Wood. Most damaging of all wa the verdict of the bookseller, who dismissed the shortlist a narcoleptic. The other contender were The Folding Star by Alan Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill Paton Walsh. In spite of heavy publicity, the novel nominated have been selling 50 per cent le than last year's shortlist. Last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sold 350,000 copy. 'Kelman's novel is unlikely to come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said. Mr Kelman wa also shortlisted for the prize in 1989 for his novel A Disaffection. It is a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a blockbuster about battle and bride in Ruritania, and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it. Out are the eminence gris of Victorian letter - novel by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make the grade. This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced by six judge, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. They have avoided dull and worthy classic and chosen six book which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide. The winner will be revealed on October 15 (four day after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature. Like today's Booker Prize, it is a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is backing the spoof award, is a significant publisher of classic Victorian novel. But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction. It raise question about how the relationship between literature and society ha changed in the past 100 year. First, the similarity. A good yarn is a good yarn. Of the 1894 book, Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croak like a crow when he dy during one of her concert. The Prisoner of Zenda tell of an Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demon. On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend. All the book on both list are gripping story. The list share key theme. Both, for instance, have book about colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which is set in the First World War in German East Africa. Both provoke in similar way. The controversial book of 1894 were Trilby, with it louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced, impregnated and offered the service of a professional baby killer for a fiver. It is now seen a Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problem finding a publisher and the powerful circulating library refused to take it. A century on, the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains vexed. Last week, a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethic. But even if Hollinghurst win the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century. For the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a Booker Prize wa not needed to sell fiction. Today, we accept the gap between literary writing, such a Hollinghurst's, and popular bestseller by writer like Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland. This is the gap the Booker try to bridge by giving high-level publicity to work which would not normally reach a mass audience. The trick work - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback copy. Before the short-list wa announced it sold 10,600. The Victorians, in contrast, were lover of contemporary fiction. Novels accounted for 20 per cent of published book, and no distinction wa made between high and low art. In the mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today. Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK wa half that of today and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copy. All the 1894 Booker writer were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writer whose book can be reread with pleasure 100 year later. Why wa fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894? Social, cultural and psychological reason play a part. Socially, the 1890s reading public wa a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle class author wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate wa to belong to an elite. The idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction wa irrelevant. Culturally, these writer and reader were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel wa their political and intellectual forum. Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel a a key genre of our age. Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow. The dominance of film and television ha made novel a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talent. George du Maurier originally offered the outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel. Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC. The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with character a if we know them, wa answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th century we have TV soap. Just a the tabloid newspaper feature character from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop wa running a a serial there wa widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would die, and reader wrote in begging for her to be saved. Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soap were clear feature of the novel in 1894. Both In the Year of Jubilee and Esther Waters, for example, centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage, feminism and the 'New Woman', yet both are also tearjerker which everyone enjoyed. The 1894 book are compelling because they prefigure our own time and yet are set back from them. Trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide paved the way for Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression. It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choice will speak a eloquently of new trend today. Whereas the 1894 title had contemporary setting, many of the 1994 book are historical (such a Paradise) or are driven by nostalgia (such a Beside the Ocean of Time). Which book will win on October 15? Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in Samoa, the setting of The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote, because it is the best-known today and ha fashionable mythic overtone in the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; it position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy Disney association and confirm it a a serious novel about a young man's self-discovery. My vote go to Trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - in it anti-Semitic portrait of Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is a story of demonic possession and haunt the imagination like a fairy tale long after better-written work have faded from memory. Like Rebecca, the popular novel by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the current Booker Prize seek to create: a combination of the classic and the bestseller. The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who?' from many in the publishing industry. According to one insider, some on the list 'are B-team writer at best'. The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which wa tipped a a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which wa almost universally well-reviewed. As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make the grade'. The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criterion - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an astonishing omission, a do new novel by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace. But if the shortlist of the final six candidate for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is a rife a ever. One unsurprising omission from the final selection wa When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which wa on the 'long list' before it wa pointed out that the author wa the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge. Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud. But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredit the award according to some critic. 'This list,' said one man of letter, 'must have dealt a final death blow to the Booker.' The winner, selected from an original 130, will be announced on October 11. The Booker Prize is Britain's literary event of the year, guaranteed to boost sale of the chosen novel after the award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in London's ancient Guildhall. The prize to the author is a check for 20,000 pound (nearly $38000), sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business. British publisher are very secretive about their sale but we know that when Thomas Keneally won it in 1982 for `Schindler's Ark,' his publisher, who had printed 15,000 copy, sold 75,000 over the next 23 week, said Christine Shaw of Book Trust. The trust is a charity promoting reading and book and administers the prize. The prize ha become internationally known, and the worldwide demand for the winning book, in English and translation, is spectacular, said Shaw. The prize wa first awarded in 1969 after talk between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing. British publisher can submit three new novel by British and Commonwealth writer. There were 110 submission last year. A management committee of author, bookseller, librarian and the sponsor chooses a jury of five: a writer or two, an academic, a politician interested in literature and a literary editor or critic. Each juror read every book submitted, list about six favorite and meet the other juror to select and announce six finalist. As public debate rage over who's in, who's out and who might win, with bookmaker across the country calling the odds, the juror meet again and finally select the winner on the afternoon of announcement day. This year's finalists: Beryl Bainbridge An Awfully Big Adventure, AS. Byatt Possession, Penelope Fitzgerald The Gate of Angels, John McGahern Amongst Women, Brian Moore Lies of Silence and Mordecai Richler Solomon Gursky Was Here. Six novel have been nominated for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmaker say the favorite is The Remains of the Day by Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro. The award, to be announced Oct. 26, carry a $31,600 prize funded by the Booker McConnell food company. Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about a butler's travel through Britain's West Country and said it wa a firm favorite to win. Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, wa beaten a the Booker favorite in 1986, which make his chance that much stronger this time in our view, said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe. The other book nominated are: Cat's Eye, a story of painter Elaine Risley and her return to her childhood home in Toronto by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, also a previous nominee. The Book of Evidence, a prison story of kidnap and murder convict Freddie Montgomery by John Banville, literary editor of The Irish Times newspaper. Jigsaw, by Sybille Bedford, an autobiographical novel about an adolescent's travel through Germany, Italy and France. A Disaffection, Scottish novelist James Kelman's story about a school teacher, Patrick Doyle, whose professional frustration are fueled by a drinking problem and unrequited love for a colleague. Restoration, British author Rose Tremain's story of Robert Merivel, a favorite of King Charles II who married the monarch's youngest mistress. We expect more interest in this year's Booker Prize than ever before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over Salman Rushdie's `Satanic Verses,' Sharpe said. Rushdie wa nominated for the prize last year but it wa won by Australian author Peter Carey for his love story Oscar and Lucinda. Rushdie, a British citizen, ha been in hiding since Feb. 14 when the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered he be killed for allegedly blaspheming Islam in Satanic Verses. This year's six nominee were chosen Thursday from 102 book considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary critic and novelist who wa nominated for the prize last year for his book, Nice Work. On the day of the Big Event, Ladbroke, the large British betting agency, posted the final odds. Brian Moore wa the favorite at 7-4, followed by Peter Ackroyd (5-2), Iris Murdoch (3-1) and Chinua Achebe (9-2). The two dark horse, Nina Bawden and Penelope Lively, were each tipped at 7-1.You may have noticed a distinctly literary tilt to that lineup, an affinity with the bookshelf, not the bookie. All of those people published new work of fiction here in Britain during the past 12 month. And for the last few week, literary punter throughout the British Isles have been placing bet on which of those writer would win the Booker Prize, the best-known, best-liked and, almost incidentally, most prestigious fiction award in the land.In recent week the Booker contender have received almost a much press coverage a the Charles and Di rift. And nearly every article, from book review to author interview, ha featured the latest odds. The betting is done largely by literary insider, say Graham Sharpe, who set the Booker odds at William Hill, Britain's other big betting agency. ""They read the book, hear the gossip and want to pull off a little coup for themselves,"" he says.Last year's winner, ""The Old Devils"" by Kingsley Amis, wa a 5-2 favorite, but this year, anyone who chose the victor made some dough.""When she accepted her prize for ""Moon Tiger,"" Penelope Lively looked surprised and pleased. ""I'm not a betting woman, and I have slight reservation about book becoming a spectator sport,"" she said in soft Oxbridge tone. ""But those who are in the know tell me that 7-1 wa an irresistible flutter."" Her 65-year-old mother wa among those who made a killing.America ha the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in term of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) Booker Prize. With the possible exception of France's respected Prix Goncourt, there's nothing quite like it anywhere else.Britons wryly compare the Booker to the Academy Awards, and though there's just one prize and no envelope, similarity exist. There's a team of judge and a pool of candidate. This year each British publisher could submit three new title, for a grand total of 93. As one judge noted wearily, ""By August, I wa in more than a slight panic, sometimes reading all day and evening; reading while standing at the bus stop, reading while cooking, reading, almost, while talking on the telephone.""Next come the ""short-list,"" the judges' top six, which wa announced with great fanfare in late September. This year the work included Brian Moore's political thriller ""The Color of Blood"" (EP. Dutton, 182 page, $16.95); Peter Ackroyd's ""Chatterton"" (Grove Press, 240 page, $17.95); Nina Bawden's ""Circles of Deceit"" (St. Martin's Press, 208 page, $14.95); Iris Murdoch's 23rd novel ""The Book and the Brotherhood"" (Viking, 608 page, $19.95); Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe's ""Anthills of the Savannah"" (Doubleday, 240 page, $16.95); and ""Moon Tiger"" (Grove Press, 216 page, $15.95).The award presentation came on the last Thursday in October, and like any major award presentation, it came complete with limousine, banquet (salmon mousse, champagne sorbet and English roast beef) and television camera. The suspense wa genuine; the judge chose the winner just three hour before the announcement.To be sure, the rating for the prime-time broadcast didn't upstage those of ""Eastenders,"" Britain's popular soap opera. Yet interest wa sufficient for Andre Deutsch, ""Moon Tiger's"" British publisher, to order up an additional 20,000 copy almost the minute Mrs. Lively -- and the nation -- heard the news.By British standard, sale figure for recent Booker winner are stunning, from ""The Old Devils"" (80,000 hard-cover copy) to Anita Brookner's ""Hotel du Lac"" (40,000 copies). Even Keri Hulme's ""The Bone People,"" a look at Maori culture that most reader found impenetrable, reached a respectable 21,000 in 1985.Short-listed author are just a few pace behind, sharing the best-seller list with Dick Francis and Scott Turow. Heinemann initially printed 3,000 copy of ""Anthills of the Savannah,"" the usual run for contemporary literary fiction. So far, 10,000 copy have sold. ""Being short-listed probably changed the destiny of that book,"" declares a member of the Heinemann sale staff. Indeed, there's currently talk of initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the year's best biography.Another notable spinoff is the Booker harpy, reader intent on digesting all six title, then vigorously disputing the choice, which never please everyone. This year the Sunday Times offered reader a complete autographed collection of the six book for the equivalent of $112, perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot.It wasn't always this way, of course. Headlines were modest back in 1969 when PH. Newby won the first ever Booker Prize for ""Something to Answer For."" (The wonderfully appropriate name come from Booker-McConnell PLC, the international food and agriculture conglomerate that put up the prize money each year.)The idea wa to devise a British equivalent to the Prix Goncourt, and like that august French award, the Booker attracted attention the minute it kicked up controversy. The early fuss wa kept within the literary world, with critic sniping over choice and the prize's varied ground rule. The real world took notice in 1974, when Elizabeth Jane Howard, one of the three judge, wrote a letter to the Times claiming that in her opinion Kingsley Amis's ""Ending Up,"" one of the short-listed book, wa his best ever. As it happens, she wa married to Mr. Amis at the time. He didn't win.But many credit the Booker's current appeal to the 1982 competition and Thomas Keneally's ""Schindler's Ark,"" or ""Schindler's List"" a it is known in the US. Written a a novel, the book told the true story of a remarkable German who saved the life of hundred of Jews in concentration camp. But even after it won the Booker, people argued that it wasn't a novel. ""The more people questioned it, the more it sold,"" say Ion Trewin, editorial director at Hodder & Stoughton. ""That wa the first year the prize caught the medium and public imagination. Suddenly the Booker gained inch on front pages.""Oh yes, ""Moon Tigers"" is a dying woman's recollection of her life a a World War II war correspondent and her affair with a young tank officer.--- Ms. Trucco is a free-lance writer based in London. Australian novelist Peter Carey wa awarded the coveted Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday night for his love story, Oscar and Lucinda. A panel of five judge unanimously announced the award of the $26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at London's ancient Guildhall. The judge made their selection from 102 book published in Britain in the past 12 month and which they read in their home. Carey, who life in Sydney with his wife and son, said in a brief speech that like the other five finalist he had been asked to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won. If I'd known I wa going to win I think I would have taken a bit more trouble with my handwriting, he said a he stared down at his note. He wa unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his novel, Illywhacker, wa among the final six. Carey called the award a great honor and he thanked the prize sponsor for provoking so much passionate discussion about literature perhaps there will be more tomorrow. Everyone who love good book benefit from this, surely, he added. The winning novel is a fitting choice for Australia's bicentennial year. It tell of a romance between an English gambler and an Australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to Australia in the mid-19th century. The story weave in Australian history from it founding in 1788 by British immigrant. Panel chairman Michael Foot, a writer and former leader of the opposition Labor Party, said the judge agreed that entry this year had been exceptionally strong and that choosing the last six novel wa extremely difficult. We hope there will be no criticism but if there are, then people should start reading the book for themselves, Foot said. Carey wa the only non-Briton in the final six. The son of an auto dealer, he wa born in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, and attended Geelong Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne, where the Prince of Wales wa also a pupil a an 18-year-old in 1966. Carey wa an advertising copywriter before turning to writing book in 1965. The first Booker Prize wa awarded in 1969. It is administered by Book Trust, an educational charity promoting book, and is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming business. Critic and novelist AS. Byatt on Tuesday won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award, for her tale of two young scholar investigating the life of a pair of imaginary Victorian poet. The five judge deliberated two hour before awarding the $39,000 prize to Antonia Byatt for Possession, one of six finalist in the 21-year-old competition. Last year's Booker winner wa Kazuo Ishiguro for his novel, The Remains of the Day. Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judge's panel, announced the prize at a banquet in London's Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor. There wa very strong individual support for several book on the short list and finally `Possession' by AS. Byatt wa the winner by a majority vote, said the judge. The panel wa unanimous, however, in agreeing that the standard of the other five novel wa exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult. Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work, ha published five novel since 1964. In Possession, she tell how two graduate student piece together the relationship and life of two imaginary Victorian poet from fragment of their letter and by retracing the poets' journey across England and to France. The influence of the past on the living is a theme throughout the book. Ms. Byatt, born in 1936, is the daughter of a lawyer and sister of novelist Margaret Drabble. Her first novel, Shadow of a Sun, concerned the effort of a woman to escape the shadow of her novelist father. A 1978 work, The Virgin in the Garden, make allegorical allusion to Shakespeare and other English literary genius in a tale of a play performed at a country house. Ms. Byatt taught English and American literature at University College in London until 1983, when she quit to write fulltime. Other finalist this year were 1979 Booker Prize winner Penelope Fitzgerald with The Gate of Angels, Irish novelist John McGahern's Amongst Women, Canadian-born Mordecai Richler's Solomon Gursky Was Here, Brian Moore's Lies of Silence, and Beryl Bainbridge's An Awfully Big Adventure. They were chosen from a list of 113 book published in the United Kingdom in 1989. The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust. It is Britain's top literary award. THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judge for this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist. The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantee great prestige, and sale, for the winner, and, say it admirer, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention. Its critic say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense medium hype of the shortlisted author doe a disservice to the horde of other gifted but unlisted writer. This year's shortlist contains no surprise. London's litterati have for week been betting on Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient - those of them who have seen a proof copy because it is not officially published until next week. Last night the bookmaker William Hill made it the 5-2 favourite. The shortlist is: Serenity House by Christopher Hope (MacMillan Pounds 1499).

The FT reviewer said that 'the misery and deprivation of working class life have never been so brutally evoked ..' Black Dogs by Ian McEwan (Secker & Warburg Pounds 1499). McEwan's fiction is uniquely disturbing - some would say deliberately offensive. He is the novelist of misanthropy. This is the tale of a failed marriage, episodically told, and the black dog of evil are both metaphorical and literal. The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje (Bloomsbury Pounds 1499). The Sri Lankan poet and novelist Ondaatje, who life in Canada, ha followed 'in the skin of a lion' with an extraordinary book about four character in a Tuscan villa in the closing month of the last war. The central metaphor is bomb - disposal of, and then Hiroshima. The 'English patient' is a central mystery around which the others' story orbit: he fell out of the sky in flames; who is he? The FT review on Saturday will hail it a a masterpiece. Daughters of the House by Michele Roberts (Virago Pounds 1499). The surprise contender because it is not yet published. Roberts come from an Anglo-French Catholic background and this informs her new novel with a strong rural-Normandy atmosphere. Two cousin, one pious, one worldly. Shades of Saint Therese of Lisieux. Lots of action in the kitchen; something is hidden in the cellar. Sacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth (Hamish Hamilton Pounds 1599).

4,d114h,"Tens of thousand of people chanting Freedom! Freedom! trekked to a Moslem saint's shrine Saturday to campaign for the secession of Kashmir from India, witness and pro-separatist activist said. At least three people died in two separate incident on Saturday in Kashmir, the center of the four-decade-old separatist campaign, witness said. The death brought to 109 the number of people killed since Jan. 20 in the latest round of the secessionist violence and the government crackdown. Meanwhile, the president of the Pakistan state of Kashmir said in an interview Saturday that Kashmiris there had begun smuggling arm across the border to Moslem insurgent fighting for independence from India. President Abdul Qayyum, speaking to a reporter who traveled to Pakistan's Kashmir, said the people of his state also had been sheltering insurgent since India launched the military crackdown in it state of Jammu-Kashmir last month. In India's Kashmir, the 600-year-old shrine of Shiekh Nuruddin Wali at Charift Sharief, 20 mile northwest of Srinagar, became a sea of humanity a Moslem men, woman and child poured in from Srinagar and nearby town. Vehicles stopped 10 mile from the shrine a people thronged the road, said witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Supporters of the militant said they went to the shrine to seek the saint's blessing to liberate Kashmir from India. In Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, resident were told by Moslem militant to put their clock back by 30 minute to correspond with the Pakistan standard time. The militant, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, are demanding either independence for Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state dominated by Moslems. Groups of young Moslem men sat at street corner, stopping passer-by and telling them to adjust their watch. At least six fight broke out when people refused to comply, said witness who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Friday, at least 200,000 people marched to the office of the United Nations Military Observers Group in Srinagar, demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir, police said. Witnesses claimed that more than 600,000 people took part. The UN. group is posted to maintain a cease-fire line drawn between Indian- and Pakistani-held Kashmir after a 1948-49 war over the region. Residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said security force fatally shot two men shouting anti-Indian slogan at Khrew, 15 mile southeast of Srinagar. In Srinagar, suspected Moslem militant shot and killed Ashok Kumar, a Hindu government employee, witness said, also speaking on condition of anonymity. Kumar wa suspected to be a police informer. India routinely accuses Pakistan of arming, training and supporting the militant. The government in Islamabad denies the charge but say the Kashmiri people have a right to self-determination. An AP reporter who traveled to Pakistan's Kashmir last week said state-run bank in the region have begun collection to help the uprising. Signs in dozen of bank called for donation for a holy war against India. Naveed Hussain, a government spokesman in Pakistan's Kashmir, said in an interview that $5,000 had been raised in a week and that the money would be used to train Kashmiri militia group in territory held by Pakistan. Kashmir wa divided between India and Pakistan after the two country were partitioned following the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Moslems blew up a truck carrying security force Wednesday, killing three soldier in the few hour the government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the Kashmiri separatist uprising, official said. In separate incident, militant shot and killed a Moslem they said wa a police informer and a Moslem died after he wa caught in an exchange of fire between militant and security force, official said. Also Wednesday, Moslem sniper fired on security force in three part of Srinagar during a five-hour relaxation of curfew, said Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state. There were no casualty, he said. The curfew wa relaxed from 5 am. to 10 am. to allow people in the city of 1 million to shop for food and other essential. An around-the-clock curfew wa imposed Friday after security force the day before shot and killed 49 Moslem demonstrator marching into Srinagar to take part in a pro-independence rally. At least 1 million Moslems demonstrated to demand independence for the predominantly Moslem state; India is predominantly Hindu. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, is the center of the separatist movement. At least 171 people have been killed in Kashmir since a government crackdown on the separatist movement began on Jan. 20. Leading national party decided Wednesday to send a high-powered delegation to Srinagar, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. It did not name the member, but it said they would go Thursday. The decision wa taken at the end of a daylong multiparty meeting on Kashmir called by Prime Minister VP. Singh. A joint statement after the meeting said despite their ideological and political difference, (the party) were one in defending the unity and integrity of the country, the news agency reported. Jagmohan said the truck wa driving around Srinagar distributing food to troop on street corner when it wa blown up by Moslem militant. He gave no further detail of the attack. The attack came amid government claim that security force arrested at least 12 leader of the Moslem group Hezbul Mujahedeen. Jagmohan said the militant, from Srinagar and the border town of Baramulla and Kupwara, have been arrested since Sunday. Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of 30 militant group fighting for secession. It is believed the second most powerful independence group after the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. We are going to hit hard at anti-national element, there is no way they can get away with what they are doing, Jagmohan said. It may take a month, six month, maybe a year, but ultimately these anti-national elments are going to be neutralized. Jagmohan, a Hindu, wa appointed the state governor of Jammu-Kashmir on Jan. 18 in an attempt by the government to control the unrest. Kashmir ha been a problem for more than four decade following the 1947 partition of British colonial India into predominantly Moslem Pakistan and the mostly Hindu India. Jammu-Kashmir, then a princely state, chose to merge with India. Pakistan protested, claiming the territory because of it predominantly Moslem population. The two country have twice gone to war over the territory. The Kashmir portion of Jammu-Kashmir is mostly Moslem, while the southern Jammu segment is predominantly Hindu. Overall, about 65 percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people and Hindus account for 82 percent. Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of houseboat hotel and Mogul garden from whose name the English made cashmere, ha become a war zone of separatism and religious enmity. Military jeep carry senior government official and civil servant around Srinagar in these dangerous day, a soldier and paramilitary trooper try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem separatist in the Kashmir Valley. Intelligence officer MK. Kaul command one of the jeep. At the beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turned to the four soldier in the jeep's rear seat and ordered: Check your weapon. Be ready to fire. Kaul settled into the front seat, a 9mm pistol in his right hand. These are bad day, he murmured. These die-hard terrorist can attack from anywhere. To his men, he said: Shoot them if you see them. On Monday, an around-the-clock curfew wa lifted from 5 am. until noon and store opened to crowd of customer. Soldiers in sandbagged bunker, armed with light machine gun, guarded main intersection. A spokesman for the Jammu-Kashmir state government said the situation wa peaceful and absolutely normal in Srinagar, the state's largest city. At least 72 people have been killed since the crackdown began Jan. 20 in an effort to curb attack on government official and building. Most of the dead have been Moslem militant shot by Indian troop. We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any popular movement, said Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority. We are fighting a handful of terrorist who are determined to create a law and order problem, said Jagmohan, a Hindu with a reputation for toughness. Other official in Kashmir say privately the situation is critical, perhaps the most serious threat India ha faced in 42 year of independence from Britain. It look like everyone here ha turned into a fundamentalist with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become independent, a state police officer said. Kashmir wa a separate kingdom, ruled by a Hindu maharajah, when Britain relinquished colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1947, and the subcontinent wa partitioned on religious line into India and Pakistan. The Hindu king opted to join India, not Pakistan, and the dispute over Kashmir ha exacerbated relation since. Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the eastern. Each accused the other of forcible occupation. They have fought war over Kashmir and the border question remains unresolved. UN. observer are stationed on the truce line and the two side occasionally trade gunfire. Officials will not say how many reinforcement have been sent to the Kashmir Valley since Jan. 20, but report from various source indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldier and paramilitary troop have been deployed. It is the valley's heavily Moslem population that tilt the sectarian scale in Jammu-Kashmir state. Of the state's nearly 6 million people, 64 percent are Moslems and 32 percent Hindus. Most Hindus live in the southern Jammu area. Srinagar ha 150 mosque. This is the best breeding ground for Moslem fundamentalism, said a federal official who help coordinate the new security measure. Nearly every mosque ha a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to prayer and, more recently, to exhort listener to defend their faith and Kashmir. The resident are constantly bombarded with Islamic sermon and are reminded that fighting a `jihad' (Islamic holy war) is the most sacred duty of every Moslem, the federal official said, on condition of anonymity. Electricity wa cut off in the city Friday, which wa both the Moslem sabbath and India's national Republic Day on India's Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeaker continued operating because militant connected them to car battery. Intelligence report suggest the government ha an advantage because the separatist are not united. The most powerful group is the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, but there are several others, including the Allah Tigers, Hezb-e-Mujahed Hezb-e-Islami. India claim the fundamentalist get money and weapon from Pakistan. The Pakistanis deny it. Jagmohan, the governor, insists the main issue in Kashmir is economic development, not separatism. The people do not want violence or the so-called independent Kashmir, he said. The need of the hour is development. Let more tourist come. Let new school be built. Let new hospital come up. As he spoke, military officer waited in the next room to discus a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist brochure call Paradise. Right now, Paradise look lost, at least temporarily. The army on Tuesday dispatched tank and troop reinforcement to the frontier with Pakistan, where soldier from the two nation have been fighting recently, official and witness said. Prime Minister VP. Singh told Parliament that Indian armed force were fully prepared to effectively deal with any eventuality. Indian and Pakistani troop clashed in a remote border area in the disputed Kashmir region Monday. Singh, who is also defense minister, said exchange of fire also occurred Tuesday. In Pakistan, a Defense Ministry spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rule, said Tuesday that Indian and Pakistani soldier exchanged artillery fire in the Kel sector along the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir into Pakistani and Indian region. He said there were no casualty among Pakistani soldier. The Pakistani official also said that on Monday and Tuesday, Indian soldier fired on Pakistani civilian traveling on a mountain road, injuring four people. He also said Indian soldier fired on an ambulance and a bus. There wa no report from India on the alleged firing. Despite the tension, official from both side said the incident did not appear to be serious. There is no cause for any undue concern since we trust that these localized incident will be contained and the situation defused, United News of India quoted Singh a saying in the Parliament. Singh said director of military operation from both country were in touch. He did not elaborate. The Pakistani official said: This is not a serious situation. It's just in one sector. It could be just a local incident. We don't know what it will lead to. We'll just have to wait and see. India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir, in 1965 and 1971. Both side claim Kashmir, which ha been divided into Indian and Pakistani sector. Tensions over Kashmir flared again this summer. India accuses Pakistan of supporting a Moslem secessionist movement in the Indian sector by providing arm and training to Moslem militant. Pakistan, an Islamic state, denies the charge but say it will back any movement for self-determination by Kashmir's people. Jammu-Kashmir state is the only one of India's state with a Moslem majority. At least 1,034 people have been killed in the Kashmir valley since New Delhi cracked down on the secessionist movement on Jan. 20. Military official in Jammu, the summer capital of India-held Kashmir, said Tuesday that tank and troop reinforcement were dispatched to the border area. At least 20 tank and 30 truck with soldier left their quarter at Kaluchak and Baridrahamna for the frontier, said witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Indian military official said the additional troop were sent to Rajauri and Poonch sector, which were the scene of fierce battle in the war of 1965 and 1971. Pakistani troop fired on Indian security force who stopped a mob of Pakistani protester from storming across the border into disputed Kashmir, official said today. At least three demonstrator were killed Sunday night, a Defense Ministry spokesman said in Islamabad. Pakistan's state-run TV said the Indian guard killed a many a six. The trouble started after Indian border guard opened fire on hundred of Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line separating Pakistan-controlled Kashmir from the Indian-held region. A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said Pakistani troop then fired about 200 round from light and medium weapon at Indian border post in the Uri sector. Indian force returned fire and the exchange continued for about half an hour, the spokesman said. No one wa hurt. A Pakistani official in Islamabad denied the accusation. Pakistani military authority and the Foreign Secretary are in touch with Indian authority to remove the misunderstanding, said Additional Foreign Secretary Khalid Mahmood in Islamabad. Pakistan's top diplomat in New Delhi, Bashir Babar, wa summoned to India's Foreign Ministry on Sunday and today and apprised of India's concern over the event, an Indian government spokesman said. A fluid 840-mile cease-fire line separate the Indian and Pakistani Kashmirs. Pakistan and Indian twice have gone to war over Kashmir, in 1948 and again in 1965. On Feb. 5, at least one person wa killed and 12 wounded when Pakistani mob tried to cross the cease-fire line near Jammu, 95 mile to the south. The two demonstration at the cease-fire line were to express support for Moslem militant who are fighting for independence for the Moslem-dominated state from the predominantly Hindu India. On Sunday, the Pakistani mob retreated when soldier of India's paramilitary border security force opened fire, said the Indian spokesman who refused to be identified. The mob returned a second time by which time it had become slightly dark, he said. That is when the Pakistani troop opened fire. A Pakistani spokesman, who also refused to be identified, said Pakistani army patrol repulsed a mob of some 1,200 demonstrator. Small group broke away from the crowd and slipped into the Indian-held territory, he said. An official of the Indian border security force, which normally patrol the border, said the Indian army today took control of the cease-fire line. Some men in the intruding crowd were armed with gun which they fired occasionally, he said. It wa becoming very difficult, our troop had to open fire, he said. Farouk Haider, vice-president of the militant Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front that is leading the uprising, said in Islamabad after the Indian firing that the situation is very confusing. Thirty-one people were wounded in the shooting, Haider said. Five were in critical condition in a hospital in Muzzafarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, he said, adding he knew of only one death. The 40-year-old conflict over Kashmir flared Jan. 20 after a government crackdown and the arrest of 250 suspected militant. Most of them were subsequently released, but the arrest sparked widespread violence. At least 85 people have been killed since the crackdown began. Most of the victim have been curfew-breaking protester shot by security force in Srinagar. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, ha been the center of the secessionist movement that ha turned violent in recent year. The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front had earlier campaigned for union with Islamic Pakistan but ha in recent year demanded independence and the status of a neutral country. About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Moslems, making it the only Moslem majority state in predominantly Hindu India's 25 state. Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million population. Hindus comprise 82 percent. Troops battled mob of Moslem separatist in the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21 people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided Sunday night, police said. Fifteen demonstrator were shot and killed Sunday, while six were fatally wounded late Saturday night, according to Mohammad Nomani, inspector general of Srinagar police. Militants defied a curfew and continued trading intermittent shot with government force on Sunday, official said. Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death toll wa at least 30, but that figure could not be confirmed. Nomani, speaking by telephone from Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, said the fighting tapered off late Sunday afternoon a heavy rain lashed the city. But gunfire echoed through the deserted street until evening, one resident said, requesting anonymity. They (the troop) are shooting at anything moving, he said. It is a disastrous situation out there, said Ramesh Kaul, a hotel receptionist in Srinagar. At least 47 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir state since the beginning of the year in violence triggered by Moslem militant demanding independence or union with Islamic Pakistan. The separatist, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, have often attacked government office and police official. The situation is tense and dangerous, the state's chief secretary, Moosa Raza, said in Jammu, the state's winter capital 95 mile south of Srinagar. Nomani said the police dispatched 25 car with loudspeaker into the city, to appeal to people to obey the curfew. The car were escorted by heavily armed troop from the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force, he said. A 24-hour curfew wa imposed Saturday in a bid to quell escalating violence and mass anti-India demonstration in Srinagar and nearby town. But late Saturday, crowd defied curfew and surged into downtown Srinagar chanting Indian dog go back! and Long live Pakistan! local reporter said. They said the paramilitary troop opened fire, killing two people instantly and injuring 14. Four of them died later. As news of the shooting spread, thousand of Moslem men poured out of their home, the reporter said. They said protester recited verse from the Koran, the Moslem holy book. Some took up a chant urging mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warrior, to prepare for the final sacrifice in a showdown with India's Hindu-dominated government. Jammu-Kashmir's former state chief minister, Farooq Abdullah, issued a statement accusing authority of letting loose a reign of terror and repression. Abdullah's Moslem-dominated National Conference Party is closely aligned with the Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi, the arch political foe of Prime Minister VP. Singh. Abdullah's government resigned Friday to protest the appointment of Singh's nominee a the state's new governor and imposition of governor's rule which amount to tighter federal control over the state. The curfew order wa one of the first act of the new governor, Jagmohan, a tough administrator who had cracked down on Kashmiri militant during an earlier stint a the state's governor. Jagmohan, a Hindu who us one name, took office Friday. Parts of Kashmir region are claimed by both India and Pakistan. The dispute started when the state wa partitioned between the two country when they gained independence from Britain in 1947. Srinagar's 800,000 people are moslty Moslem, a is a majority of population in the Kashmir region. The Jammu region is predominantly Hindu. India ha often accused Pakistan of aiding the Kashmiri militant, a charge Pakistan ha denied. Jammu-Kashmir is the only state with a Moslem majority in predominantly Hindu India. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state population of 5 million. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880 million people, while Hindus comprise 82 percent. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Thursday accused India of waging genocide in secession-minded Kashmir and of trying to start a war with Pakistan to deflect attention. Her remark raised tension further between India and Pakistan, which have been feuding over Indian-controlled Kashmir. The two country, which have fought war over the area in 1949 and 1965, have in recent week again built up their military force near the common border. India is indulging in genocide, Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight Moslem country in the Middle East and North Africa. Islamic scholar are being killed and innocent people are being slaughtered. This is deplorable, said the prime minister. She wa referring to the assassination of Maulvi Mohammad Farooq, the top Moslem cleric in Indian Kashmir. During his funeral procession Monday, Indian force shot to death 58 people. Ms. Bhutto returned late Wednesday from visit to Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, North Yemen, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, a high-profile diplomatic offensive to drum up support for Pakistan's stand on the Kashmir issue. Hindu-dominated India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Kashmiri militant fighting for secession of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with a Moslem majority. Pakistan, which is dominated by Moslems, denies the Indian charge. Since the Indian government ordered a crackdown on the militant in late January, more than 400 people have been killed. During her trip abroad, Ms. Bhutto said all her host country agreed that India and Pakistan needed to find a lasting political settlement of the 43-year-old dispute. However, she added, If subjected to aggression, we would have the full support of the Arab Islamic nation. Pakistan, I wa assured, would never be left alone. We believe the threat to peace are grave, she said. We cannot rule out the possibility of an armed conflict, but we do not believe war is inevitable, she told reporter. Ms. Bhutto said she opposes an independent Kashmir. She said it wa not envisioned when India and Pakistan gained independence in a 1947 partition. The prime minister again called for talk between Pakistan and India. She also said a neutral body should look into the charge made by both side. India ha already rejected both suggestion. Moslem extremist abducted a leading businessman and an educator Friday and threatened to kill them, a day after authority killed six militant crossing into Pakistan for arm and training, police said. Roads were blocked around Srinagar, where the hostage were seized, and soldier tightened security around the Kashmir Valley, where the government launched a crackdown Jan. 20 on the Moslem separatist movement. A telephone caller told a local reporter the abductor were also holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24 hour of a Monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed militant. The caller claimed to speak for the Students Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Moslem state. India itself is overwhelmingly Hindu. Police source, who demanded anonymity, and the telephone caller both identified the new kidnap victim a Vice Chancellor Mushir ul-Haq of Kashmir University and LM. Khela, general manager of Hindustan Machine Tools Co. The caller said ul-Haq's private secretary also wa being held hostage, but that could not be confirmed. Moslem separatist had warned Indian government official to leave Jammu-Kashmir state before April or face the consequence. Police said the border violence took place in Kupwara district, where at least 20 separatist tried to sneak into neighboring Pakistan to receive military training and buy weapon. No detail were available. India say Pakistan train and arm the militant in Kashmir, at the far northern tip of India. Pakistan denies it. India and Pakistan have fought two war over the region since 1947, when both nation won independence from Britain. Pakistani and Indian troop exchanged fire for several hour today after a Pakistani soldier became the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border, officer and a western observer said. The soldier wa shot in the leg Sunday at a ceasefire line, several mile from the village of Chaukothi, official said on condition of anonymity. They said there were no report of casualty from today's firefight at the line, which divide Kashmir between Pakistan and India. The nation have twice gone to war over the Himalayan state, in 1948 and again in 1965. The former princely state wa divided between the two nation after British colonial rule ended in 1947. Relations between the neighbor have become increasingly strained since Jan. 20 when Indian troop launched a military crackdown on Moslem separatist in turbulent Jammu-Kashmir. The militant want India's only majority Moslem state to either become independent or join Pakistan. Jammu-Kashmir is an aberration in India, where 82 percent of the country's 880 million people are Hindus. The leader of both country have tried to soothe temper in the dispute and have said another war over the region is unlikely. However, Pakistani force have now sealed off the border area at Chaukothi, forbidding civilian from entering the area. The border crossing wa the scene of a bloody confrontation on Feb. 11 between Indian troop and Pakistani student, who were marching in solidarity with activist in Indian-held Kashmir. Indian troop killed three student and wounded several during that confrontation, a Pakistan defence ministry spokesman said. The two army also exchanged gunfire for about 30 minute before calm wa restored. A Paksitan army captain, who said he witnessed the firefight, said unlike the occasional shooting in the past, Indian soldier appeared to be aiming at Pakistani troop. The western observer said Sunday's shooting of the Pakistan soldier appeared to back up that assertion. In another sign of increased tension, Pakistani and Indian officer are no longer accompanying United Nations' military observer a they pas through the border. It is not a normal situation, the officer said. The border is extremely tense. Pakistan official said they were taking step to quell what one official called war fever on the Pakistan side. We are trying to tie the people down, said Amir Alan Khan, a retired lieutenant colonel who head Kashmir's civil defence. He said hundred of retired soldier have approached him to ask for order to fight the Indian army. The body of four Moslems were found in a Kashmir town Monday, five day after they were kidnapped by Moslem militant agitating for secession from India. The body, which had bullet wound, were found in the town of Sopore about 35 mile northwest of the Kashmir capital of Srinagar, said police official speaking on condition of anonymity. Anonymous caller to local newspaper and news agency office said the four were killed by the Hezbul Mujahedeen because they were police informer. The Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of more than a dozen Moslem organization fighting for independence of the Kashmir valley from India. Police official also reported the death of one soldier in a militant ambush of an army convoy in the district of Baramulla, northwest of Srinagar. At least three soldier were injured, they said. The death raise to 630 the number of people killed since security force began a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20. The Kashmir valley, most of which fall in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, is predominantly Moslem. Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority. Moslem militant earlier had demanded union with Pakistan, the Islamic nation on India's western border. But, of late, they have been demanding independence and the status of a neutral nation. A leader of the Moslem separatist movement in Kashmir tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker Friday but wa killed in a volley of police gunfire. Tens of thousand of Moslems gathered later for the funeral. Comrades fired into the air and vowed to carry on the fight for independence from India. Ashfaq Majid Wani, 28, wa a leader of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, a leading separatist group. He wa the front's area commander in Srinagar. Police said he tried to throw the grenade at a police bunker in downtown Srinagar while riding by on a motor scooter. The grenade went off after officer opened fire with automatic weapon. Three other people died in the melee, the police said. Hours later, thousand of resident gathered near Wani's house in an attempt to hold a funeral procession in defiance of a government curfew. But soldier and police prevented the procession and took Wani's body to a burial ground in a government ambulance escorted by a police jeep. Women wailed and beat their chest a Wani's body wa taken out of the ambulance and placed near the grave. Men shouted: Ashfaq's blood will usher independence! A group militant fired pistol and automatic rifle in the air. Witnesses estimated the crowd at 40,000. The firing continued intermittently for more than one hour until the body wa interred at 5 pm. We will carry forward Asfaq's mission, which wa to gain independence, said one militant leader holding a Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifle. He refused to give his name. The secessionist movement ha been alternately simmering and flaring since 1948, when the Hindu ruler of the old princely state of Kashmir, faced with the option of merging either with India or Islamic Pakistan, chose India.

5,d112h,"DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchase of share in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public company, have been obtained by the Financial Times. Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, ha broken his silence and ha admitted that transfer of MCC share to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, were made on the instruction of Robert Maxwell. This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner ha given detail of the relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the Maxwell family. The FT ha also obtained a letter and ha seen a corroborating fax which show that Mr Kevin Maxwell wa intimately involved in the purchase of 9m share by Yakosa and a further 16m share by Servex, another Swiss Trust. The MCC purchase by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price. The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchase of the share by the Swiss trust. If either had a financial interest in the Swiss trust, the purchase should have been disclosed under company law, because they were both director of MCC. The document demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two Swiss trust so that they could pay for the MCC share. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted a broker to the deal. Goldman's lawyer are convinced that it acted properly. Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he ha maintained since Robert Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family. He said MCC share purchase had been 'going on for some time' through Yakosa. He denied that the share were bought for Yakosa's 'own account'. He said the share were bought for other 'foundations' and then 'held for a certain time.' He also stressed that ownership of the MCC share no longer rested with Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said. Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which is based in Liechtenstein, but said it wa neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell. The FT ha however obtained document showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell wa closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC share on behalf of two Swiss trust, Yakosa and Servex. On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcel of 12.5m MCC share each would be bought by the Swiss trust with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company. The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the fund would be remitted to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from it account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury'. Two other fax sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same day show that the former wa equally involved in the other end of the transaction, the sale of the 25m share. The Swiss trust bought the share, using Goldman a broker, from two Maxwell pension fund, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme) and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme). Each pension fund sold 12.5m share at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds 27.47m in total. At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other fax to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension fund. As a director of MGPT and a a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each pension fund what it wa owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr Maxwell described a 'nominee' for the two pension fund. In other word, he told Mr Wood that the share were being bought for the Swiss trust with fund provided by BIT and that these fund should then be sent by Goldman back to BIT. In the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer in it account at Barclays. Goldman then levied it commission and expense on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest account. Scots bank bow out, Page 8 Claims to Israeli share, Page 8 Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicling the life and time of the late Robert Maxwell. Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's son, Kevin and Ian, have prompted Sir Nicholas to apply to the High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production. The musical tell the tycoon's life story through updated version of familiar tune from Gilbert and Sullivan. Now in rehearsal, the show is due to open at London's Criterion theatre on February 11. The attorney-general's move to close down a West End production before it first night is regarded a without precedent. However, it is no more unprecedented, most lawyer say, than the prospect of the Maxwell brother having to commute to their trial at the Old Bailey past a theatre advertising the story of their father a 'the musical review that will make you laugh, sing - and be angry'. The musical, which ha cost Pounds 1.1m to put on, ha been produced by Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private company. Mr Steadman indicated yesterday he intended the show to go on and that the attorney-general's application for an injunction would be contested. However, he said he wa leaving matter in the hand of his lawyer. Press coverage of the late publisher since his death ha already caused deep concern to the Maxwell brothers' lawyer . Mr Alun Jones QC, Kevin Maxwell's barrister, led call for reporting restriction to be placed on a recent High Court ruling that Robert Maxwell had been fraudulent in his dealing with share in Berlitz, the publishing company. Turning down his request, the judge asked him: 'Is it going to be your client's defence that Mr Robert Maxwell wa not guilty of misappropriation?' At that point, lawyer in court themselves fell about laughing. MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell company, is named a one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payment from Mirror Group Newspapers bank account during the last financial year, according to the chairman's statement released with MGN account yesterday. Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, two son of the late Robert Maxwell, are named a the other two people most involved in these transaction. Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Stoney refused to provide MGN with information, the statement say. Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, list a series of transaction - some of which he stress may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few month. He say legal action may be taken against a number of organisation, including Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, over more than Pounds 40m in transfer from MGN if the bank wa aware that they were 'effected for improper purposes'. Notes to the account show that MGN made extraordinary provision of Pounds 421.5m in the year to December 29 1991, including Pounds 208.6m in pension deficiency and Pounds 122.4m in transaction with Maxwell-controlled company. Sir Robert say that during the year there were at least 28 'unusual' payment for more than Pounds 1m from the group's bank account, making a total of more than Pounds 180m. 'Some may well ultimately be established to have arisen under legitimate transactions.' Nine of the payment were authorised solely by Robert Maxwell. The others were authorised mainly by Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Michael Stoney, he say. One transfer to Goldman Sachs wa countersigned by Mr Ernest Burrington, former managing director, at the request of Mr Kevin Maxwell on the reported instruction of Robert Maxwell. Two authorisation were countersigned by Mr Lawrence Guest, former MGN finance director. Sir Robert say the MGN director do not believe that either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest knew there wa anything improper about these payment. With these exception, 'the independent director . . . were not involved in, and did not authorise or approve any of these payments,' he say. Sir Robert say the group finance department accepted assurance from the treasury department - which wa headed by Mr Stoney - about 'the nature of certain transactions' including payment to financial institution which were recorded a deposit. 'The treasury department arranged for it to appear that sum of interest had been credited to the group in respect of those 'deposits',' he say. In his report Sir Robert point to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN board: Internal control and operating procedure which failed to identify related party transaction and bring them to the attention of independent director for approval; Bank mandate authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the movement of group fund on the authority of Maxwell or director who were also director of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive director, which might have reviewed system and mandate, but wa not convened; The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activity. The report detail a Pounds 50m loan made by Bankers Trust in London last October which appears to have been used to pay off a loan from Bankers Trust in New York to Robert Maxwell Group, parent of the Maxwell private interest, Separately, the statement highlight three transfer of more than Pounds 40m from MGN to Goldman Sachs - Pounds 11m of this wa transferred on Robert Maxwell's signature to pay for previous dealing in Maxwell Communication Corporation stock. The balance wa for foreign exchange trade exposure incurred by Bishopsgate Investment Trust and Robert Maxwell Group, it say. He say MGN is inquiring to see whether it can establish if Goldman Sachs wa 'aware or should have been aware' that the transfer 'had been effected for improper purposes'. If so, he say 'it will be possible to seek order against them . . . for the sum paid.' He say MGN is considering legal action against professional adviser in relation to property lease, and hope to recover money through claim on insurance policy written on Robert Maxwell's life. ABOUT 20 bank became con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of business run by Robert Maxwell several month before he died and his business empire collapsed. Their concern arose when Maxwell Communication Corporation made late payment to them, a Financial Times investigation ha discovered. Yet although some bank became alarmed at the implication for the financial health of his empire, they did not discus their concern with each other or with authority such a the Bank of England. Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's former finance director, ha described his shock to the FT at discovering last August that MCC had failed to settle foreign currency transaction with about 20 bank on time. Starting about July 4 1991, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Maxwell and his son, Kevin, had begun to buy and sell enormous amount of foreign currency. In these 'spot' transaction, MCC would buy a currency in one financial centre promising to make payment in another centre. On a number of occasion, MCC received the currency, but did not make the payment - thereby giving itself an unauthorised loan. Mr Brookes say about 20 bank, including Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, were involved in the flurry of foreign exchange deal. At least Dollars 100m (Pounds 55m) in unapproved credit is thought to have been raised this way. A former Maxwell employee said some appeared to have been channelled into private Maxwell business. One banker said attempt to raise money by making late payment in the foreign market wa a relatively well-known ruse with the nickname called 'teaming and lading'. It also emerged yesterday that National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender to the Maxwell private company, felt badly let down by Maxwell because he failed to deliver fund on time at the end of July. At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on July 10, NatWest refused Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m. NatWest wa upset three week later when it provided fund - le than Pounds 100m - to the Maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repaid the same day, and then found that repayment wa not made. NatWest wa forced to convert this 'intra-day' transaction into a short-term loan, which wa eventually repaid. The bank told both Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell that it wa concerned that repayment had not been made, but it did not discus the problem with other bank or with the Bank of England. Instead, it pressed on with it policy of reducing the size of it loan to the Maxwell business. NatWest's loan to the Maxwell empire now total Pounds 182m, half the level of two year ago. Later last year, Robert Maxwell made many repayment to bank by looting pension fund asset and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercise with US investment bank, from which ten of million of dollar were borrowed at a high price.

THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell liked to think of himself a a 'strong ' chess player and there wa always a chess set in his suite in his London headquarters. 'There is no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually wa a strong player or that he played in any tournaments,' said Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday took over the business and asset of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge. There may be doubt about Robert Maxwell's strength a a player but le about his enthusiasm for the game. In 1990, through The European newspaper, he sponsored a section of the World Chess championship in New York. And when Pergamon wa sold to Elsevier last year Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing business. Mr Pein said it had taken most of the year since Mr Maxwell's death to prise the business, which include Chess Monthly and Bridge Monthly from the administrator to the Maxwell empire. 'Price Waterhouse took month and month to come up with any information about the company,' said Mr Pein. Even when the new company had reached agreement to buy the business from Price Waterhouse, administrator to the public Maxwell company they then ran into trouble with Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell business. Mr Pein said the new company wanted to use and pay for the premise of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge - prefabricated building in the village of Wheatley, Oxfordshire - until they found permanent premise. However, he said that Arthur Andersen wanted two year back rent. Despite the year of difficulty, Chess and Bridge is now set up in new premise in Euston Road, London. The company said it had the largest collection of chess and bridge book and product in the UK. Two writ have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension scheme controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure it own debt from Maxwell interest would be repaid. The writ were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustee for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme. The trustee seek more than Dollars 100m for the sale of share plus interest, commission charge and punitive damage from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of international equity trading. The writ centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC share from the pension scheme by two Swiss trust, Servex and Yakosa, which were transacted through Goldman and for which the scheme were never paid. The writ allege Goldman wa aware the trust were controlled by Robert Maxwell. The writ also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman wa due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer 'with close connection to Robert Maxwell'. The writ claim that Goldman wa 'competing directly with it customer, the pension fund trustee, for payment'. On April 26 1991, they say, Mr Kevin Maxwell told Mr Sheinberg to sell the pension scheme share to the Swiss trust. On May 23 he told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension scheme but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew or should have known wa controlled by the Maxwell family. The writ allege that after the deal wa struck Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension fund administrator, told Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to BIT. The writ say that Goldman and Sheinberg 'made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the share be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m share should go'. Goldman said it had 'received no money or other benefit from these transaction other than it brokerage commission of Pounds 110,000 which were substantially le than the amount of the applicable stamp duty paid to the Inland Revenue of Pounds 215,000'. Mirror's flagship publication is the tabloid Daily Mirror, with sale of three million copy daily. Last month, in another money-raising move, Mr. Maxwell's Maxwell Communication Corp. sold it Pergamon Press PLC unit for #440 million. In other change, Mr. Maxwell's son Ian, who ha been appointed deputy chairman of Mirror Group, will resign from his post at Maxwell Communication, where he wa joint deputy managing director. Maxwell Communication said last month that it management would be taken over by Kevin Maxwell, Ian's brother. Robert Maxwell bought Mirror Group in 1984 from Reed International PLC for #113 million. Through staff cut and heavy spending on printing facility, Mr. Maxwell built Mirror into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper group. In 1990, Mirror had profit of #37.2 million, or 28.2 penny a share, on revenue of #445 million. Proceeds from the share flotation will be used to strengthen and refinance the group's balance sheet. About #210 million will be used to pay back bank loan and the rest to pay in full a loan from Robert Maxwell Holdings Ltd. Salomon Bros. International is underwriting the international part of the offering, covering approximately one-third of the share on sale, to be privately placed with institutional investor in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The other two-thirds of the share are to be divided between private and institutional investor in Britain. A relatively low minimum-investment figure of #250 ha been set to attract small investor, particularly reader of Mirror publication.

Maxwell, who put together a publishing empire following his immigration to Britain in 1940, was found dead off the coast of the Canary Islands after apparently having fallen overboard from his yacht. There are allegations that Maxwell, along with two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, and a senior executive in several Maxwell corporations, Michael Stoney, were involved in the illegal transfer of funds to help his publishing empire fend off debt. The scheme used Swiss trusts and a number of institutions, including the U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs.","Robert Maxwell has been described as the Citizen Kane of his time. The mysterious death of this larger than life individual on November 5 has left the economic affairs of Maxwell Communications Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers is a state of confusion. Maxwell was born in Czechoslovakia and immigrated to Britain in 1940 to escape the Holocaust. He put together and personally ran world-wide publishing empire that included Macmillan Publishing House in New York, Britain's Daily mirror, the Daily Record and the European and British Printing Company, and communications Corp., Britain's largest printing company. Improprieties have been alleged in the handling of funds which involve not only Robert Maxwell, but two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, as well as Michael Stoney, an executive in several Maxwell companies. At issue is the alleged improper transfer of funds in an attempt to handle his publishing empire's crushing debts. Among the interests named in the transfer of funds to two Swiss trusts, is the U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs. Maxwell also is accused of using MCC in an effort to raise funds by making late payments on the foreign market. In doing so, MCC in effect gave itself an unauthorized loan.",British entrepreneur Robert Maxwell and sons guilty of financial fraud.,British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell died in 1991 in the waters off Canary Island while on vacation.

His sons Kevin and Ian took over the business but were soon implicated along with their father in an illegal scheme to deal with crushing debts. Allegedly, unauthorized loans were acquired by using a Maxwell company to buy currency in one financial center while promising, but often failing, to make payments to another center. Some repayments were made by looting pension funds.","British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, publisher of Britain's Daily Mirror, bought the New York Daily News in 1990.

6,d111h,"Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- Today, the Foreign Ministry said that control operation carried out by the corvette Spiro against a Korean-flagged [as received] ship fishing illegally in Argentine water were carried out ""in accordance with international law and in coordination with the Foreign Ministry."" The Foreign Ministry thus approved the intervention by the Argentine corvette when it discovered the Korean ship Chin Yuan Hsing violating Argentine jurisdictional water on 21 May. The Argentine Navy reported today that the corvette Spiro stayed near the Korean ship ""given the adverse weather condition, and fulfilling it responsibility of sea search and rescue."" The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in Argentine water, wa sunk by it own crew after failing to answer to the Argentine ship's warning. The crew wa transferred to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which wa sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking ship. The Navy reported that around 15 nautical mile off the coast of Malvinas and ""in accordance with bilateral agreement with Great Britain, the Spiro transferred assistance responsibility to British authorities."" The Foreign Ministry said ""an understanding with the UK for operation in case of uninterrupted persecution of illegally fishing ship wa implemented."" The Foreign Ministry also said the policy ""is in accordance with the growing international opinion currently giving priority to the preservation, regulation, and the sustainable use of marine live resource and the effective punishment of violator of national law on the matter."" An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy sea and high wind, the government said, and there wa concern oil in it hold could leak and damage the environment. The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warning from the US. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallon of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill. No injury were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which wa 600 mile south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Salvage effort had been hampered by 50 mph wind. The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique. Telam did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when it went down. The depth of the water in which the ship sank wa not immediately known. The ship had been carrying supply including jet fuel, gasoline and canister of compressed gas to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science Foundation said in a statement released in Washington. The ship ran aground Saturday about two mile from Palmer Station, a US. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in it hull, and some of the 250,000 gallon of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near Palmer station. The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and ha affected penguin, sea gull and giant petrel bird, the National Science Foundation statement said. There were no immediate detail about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings. Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank that the leak, which wa threatening penguin and other wildlife, had stopped. Scientists are concerned that some research search project may already have been affected by the leak, a foundation statement said. It said two Argentine salvage vessel were expected to arrive Thursday or Friday. Before the sinking, Argentine official had discounted a spill. Telam quoted Argentine navy source a saying: The fuel it carried, both for itself and the Antarctic station, wa in steel drum so a spill is practically impossible. The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82 passenger and 234 crew member, were rescued by power boat and taken to Palmer Station. The passenger and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewman remain at the station, said Renerie. Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food ha been rationed to two meal a day, a National Science Foundation statement said. Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament and one of the most powerful politician in the Socialist Party, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 year ago. Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called Lucona scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee. Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resigned Jan19. Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian Ocean. Six sailor died. The Lucona's cargo wa officially described by Proksch a for a uranium processing plant and insured for $16 million. The insurance company ha never paid, claiming the cargo wa only scrap metal and alleging the vessel wa intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money. Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud, ha been variously described to be living in Syria, the Philippines and Latin America. In several interview, Gratz described himself a a close friend of Proksch, but when Proksch fled to escape prosecution, Gratz criticized him. Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in February, hence his post a president, one of the most prestigious post in Austria. My decision is a personal one and it is politically motivated, Gratz told the house. If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issue or to speak up on problem of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council (parliament) in such a way a is his duty. In past newspaper story, Gratz wa accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment wa for a uranium processing plant. Gratz, who denied the allegation, wa also accused of helping Proksch in several other way. Like Blecha, Gratz is to appear before the parliamentary investigation committee. A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew member were rescued from life raft, a coast guard spokesman said. The ship sank at about 12:45 pm. in high wind, some 28 nautical mile north of the island of Ameland. It wa not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 mile off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who wa not identified. There were no casualty, he said. The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview, identified the ship involved a the Finnish-registered freighter Ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer. He did not give the ship's origin or destination. The nine crew member boarded two life raft after the sinking in high wind. They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 mile from the site of the sinking, the official said. A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boat also rushed to the scene. Earlier report had said that the ship wa a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ship plying the frequent ferry lane between the coastal island and the Dutch mainland. Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of it vicinity to the port of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany. A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy wa scuttled by it own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday. During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck sitting upright and proud two week ago. Then the American oceanographer, whose father wa of British background and whose mother wa of German heritage, addressed himself to the German people in German. I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter, he said, translating himself back into English. We found no human remains. We touched nothing and took nothing. . The future of the Bismarck is in the hand of the German people. He said he will disclose it exact location only to Germany so Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship, which sank after a battle May 27, 1941. Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire. Only scuttled ship tend to make it to the bottom in one piece, Ballard said. It appears the crew opened it up along it entire length. It wa clearly flooded, stem to stern. Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken a a war prize, he added. It is known that two year earlier, Hitler ordered the German pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it wa cornered in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ship. Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the secret of the Graf Spee's construction and weapon. In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main gun were quickly knocked out and the attacking British ship were out of range of her secondary gun, Ballard said, so it wa helpless and taking hundred of hit it sinking clearly inevitable. Rendered unsteerable by torpedo dropped by tiny fabric-covered British biplane, it wa unable to escape. Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire, Ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce sea it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the Germans were giving up. Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hand. The Bismarck wa found by Ballard in more than 15,000 foot of water about 600 mile west of Brest, France. He said it wa in remarkably good shape, elegant, well preserved. Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had left convoy unprotected and thrown all his capital ship in pursuit with a ringing three-word command: Sink the Bismarck! Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived. British ship picked up 110 survivor but left with hundred of German sailor still in the icy water after spotting what might have been a German U-boat. German vessel later rescued only five more survivor. The story ha been recounted in book, song and a movie. The sinking occurred only eight day after the Bismarck left Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have posed a critical threat to convoy of merchant shipping and undercut British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power. The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within five day of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the vessel's crew of 1,419. The Hood wa a symbol of British sea power, and it loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of crucial importance. Ballard said under law of the sea, the Bismarck remains the property of the German people. The sunken battleship wa discovered and photographed by the same remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four year ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg. A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the Voyage of the Damned wa mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane, official said Tuesday. They're going to have to move it, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Veronica Cady. The 85-foot Ostwind yacht wa supposed to become an artificial reef in 250 foot of water about two mile off the coast. It wa sunk June 4, 50 year after the US. Coast Guard turned away the SS St. Louis a it more than 900 Jewish passenger were seeking refuge from the Holocaust. The sinking site wa supposed to be near where the Coast Guard intercepted the St. Louis, whose passenger also were turned away by Cuba and forced to return to Europe. Most of the passenger later died in Nazi concentration camp. For unexplained reason, the Ostwind wa pushed off a barge about a mile north of the site, and is resting in 25 foot of water on a living reef. It wa truly an incredible, incredible historic event, and suddenly boom! somebody made a mistake, said Mayor Abe Resnick, a Holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event. Federal and Dade County official who allowed Resnick to sink the boat are upset about the result. They didn't even come close, complained Susan Markely, an administrator with Dade's environmental department. Coast Guard Lt. Al Crespo said the yacht is balanced on a delicate living reef, threatening damage to coral and sponge. It's also close to an anchoring spot for freighter and other vessel heading to the port of Miami and ha been marked with a flashing buoy, he said. It's close enough that if a ship swing on it anchor, it could hit it, Crespo said. The Army Corps of Engineers said the Ostwind must be moved or cut to piece by June 22. If it's not, the government will remove it and bill Resnick. Resnick blame the mistake on AM. Daly Jr., captain of the tug that towed the yacht to where it wa sunk. Daly, however, said Chris Cadley, captain of a passenger boat that accompanied him, had agreed to lead him to the site. Cadley denied that, saying he only agreed to meet Daly off the coast. Resnick said someone will have to pay. I think's that's going to end up being decided by attorney, said Ben Mostkoff, the county's artificial reef director. The Ostwind wa built at Hitler's direction, although he rarely used it. After World War II, the badly decayed boat wound up in the hand of a Jacksonville marina owner. A Florida couple said their pleasure boat wa sunk by whale off Costa Rica and they survived 66 day at sea by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the US. Coast Guard reported Sunday. William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were weak but recovering at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said US. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo. The survivor told authority they lost about 50 pound each from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by telephone early Sunday. The US. Coast Guard's Pacific Command is headquartered in Alameda, 10 mile east of San Francisco. William Butler told Coast Guard official their 40-foot pleasure boat Sibonay wa attacked and sunk by several whale on June 15 about 1,200 mile southwest of Costa Rica. They were large, according to Mr. Butler, Vallecillo said. But he didn't know how many whale. The couple's last radio contact wa June 13, when they talked to their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said. Vallecillo said he'd heard of boat running into marine mammal when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there are any recorded case of whale aggression. This happened in the early morning hour with good visibility, he said. This is the first (case) I've documented. As the boat wa sinking, the couple said, they grabbed fishing rod and a salt-water purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat, where they remained for the next two month, Vallecillo said. As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two month, the Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pound of fish and survived multiple shark attack by sealing puncture with a raft repair kit. Butler told US. Coast Guard official that several time the couple spotted merchant ship but were unable to flag them down. On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making it fishery patrol about 30 mile off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued the couple. They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said. Butler is an experienced sailor, he said. Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, were flying to Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunited with their parent, Vallecillo said. Greek diver have plunged 162 foot beneath the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionary in 1822. The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical account place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert. The Bourloti Seimaz or Explosives Invincible wa set afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios. Thousands of islander died in the Turkish raid, which shocked other nation and swung Western European country behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greece won independence in 1830. The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture, The Massacre of Chios, based on the raid. It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the War of Independence, Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press. Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an underwater archaeology course to local diver last winter, started querying fisherman about where their net snagged on seabed obstacle. He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said. When I dived, I found ships' timber sticking out of the muddy seabed and dozen of object Islamic cooking pot, cannon ball, a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church, he said. The ship wa obviously crammed with loot from Chios. I think there may be gold and silver item a well, he said. I also saw what I recognized a human bone, he added. He said the wreckage indicated the vessel wa at least 100 foot in length. According to historian, more than 1,000 people including 400 Greek captive were aboard the ship when Kanaris staged his attack in the early hour of June 7, 1822. The Greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of Psara, towing a boat stuffed with explosive. Its pointed bow wa rammed into the mouth of a cannon on the Bourloti Seimaz and a fuse lit. The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, wa killed in the blast that split the ship. Kanaris and his crew of Greeks escaped. This is a very significant, very emotive find, coming from this particular period of history, said George Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine archaeology. Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely is attempted at depth over 113 foot, but he said, This is a ship that must be explored. Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap American and Turkish expertise to excavate the wreck a an international project. American expert from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A & M University, working in cooperation with Turkish diver, have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast. Greek marine archaeologist focus on locating and surveying historic wreck scattered around the Aegean and rarely carry out excavation. Ferries are among the safest vessel afloat. But, a the tragic sinking of the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 life demonstrates, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high. As ferry increase in size, so the number on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up. The move to roll-on roll-off ferry with vehicle deck which run the entire length of the vessel ha increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow door or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and it member, the ship-owning nation, have devoted much thought over the past two decade to ship safety. But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety. Particularly worrying are the eyewitness report which suggest that water penetrated the bow door in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987. Unlike the Herald, the Estonia appears to have had it door closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration. Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issue. First the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered. Additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulge which project from the ship's side just above the water line. Greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barrier or bulkhead to break up the large car deck. These proposal were looked at by the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise. It calculated that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m to improve standard on the 57 vessel in the UK ferry fleet, with a further Pounds 22m in extra annual running cost. Higher cost would inevitably lead to higher fare - unwelcome to ferry operator when, on the short cross-Channel route, they face competition from the Channel tunnel. But the difficulty of pushing through fare rise would be nothing like a damaging to the ferry company a another disaster. Second, the IMO and national government must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulation. The IMO ha been trying to move enforcement up it agenda, but it depends on the good will and professionalism of government and shipowner. Third, the IMO should be given support by national government in it campaign, launched yesterday, to improve crew training. Much of the regulation in recent year ha concentrated on improving the ship and it equipment. Above all, if new regulation doe turn out to be necessary, it must be introduced speedily. As thing stand, it can take year before change are ratified by enough government to give them force. The European Union, which Sweden and Finland are getting ready to join, could take a lead in speeding up the process. Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector. Five (small) ferry were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register. But this figure pale into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ship and 12 tanker which also went down. When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew go down in a distant ocean, very little attention is paid. If the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in European water can make shipping safety a higher priority for government and the public, this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the Estonia. Two sailor were missing Monday evening after a 652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sank in rough sea 400 mile southeast of Cape Cod. Twenty-three crew member were rescued. The 23 sailor from the Star of Alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York. They're all in good shape, some minor cut and scrape, Midgett said. The two missing sailor were believed to be on a life raft, which wa the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search plane, official said. The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft, but it turned out to be empty. The cause of the sinking wa not immediately known, official said. The Star of Alexandria had been en route from Athens, Greece, to New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in 12-foot sea and wind up to 35 mph, Midgett said. The first mayday call went out at 9:05 am. A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130 plane from Elizabeth City, N.C., converged on the ship. The lifeboat wa spotted around noon. The C-130 wa able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew member and they were able to establish communication, Midgett said. About four hour later, they were rescued by the Ravenscraig. The Star of Alexandria wa not spotted, and wa presumed to be sinking or sunk, Midgett said. Visibility in the rough sea wa five to eight mile Monday afternoon. The Star of Alexandria wa built in 1966, and wa registered in England. It wa designed to carry bulk freight, and wa owned by Caribene Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a Paris-based shipping registry. The Ravenscraig had been bound for England, but it destination after it rescue mission wa not immediately known.

7,d118i,"John G. Tower ha fallen, but the sky ha not. For all the forecast of dire result if the Senate blocked Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding a usual. President Bush said the case wa closed and accepted Democratic assurance of future cooperation. That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more ardent Republican ally in the Senate and in some corner of the White House. Bush lieutenant claimed they had heard what sounded like assurance of support from a dozen Senate Democrats. They ended up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against Tower. Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator wa denied confirmation a secretary of defens, the water have closed. There will be ripple, and some of them could be wave-sized. The good-behavior rule set in the debate over Tower's drinking habit and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked a precedent whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target. We've established what will be known a the Tower standard, said Sen. John Warner, R-Va. That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright. But it will be a debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that wa ordained long before the Tower episode. While President Bush wa unwavering in his support of Tower, he burned no bridge to congressional Democrats. He insisted that Tower wa the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice, even after it wa clear that the nomination wa doomed. But he didn't get nasty about it, saying there wa no point in escalating the fight. That's over, he said 24 hour after the Tower defeat. That's history. And now we are going to go forward. The 53-47 vote against Tower wa a setback to Bush in the sense that it always is a defeat when Congress denies a president something he want. But this denial did not cost Bush a program, or a major campaign pledge, or the support of voter. Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon. It wa a break Bush could not make with a political ally who had been after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan wa elected president. Tower had not been a Reagan man he had supported Bush for the 1980 nomination. And the Reagan White House went to some length to rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any Cabinet post. After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his own loyalty, all the way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee. Tower not only shunned withdrawal; he offered condition that had to be humiliating, if only the Senate would let him have the job. Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national television. And when that didn't work, he offered to become the first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans proposed that he get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency. No deal. So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be rejected, the first who wa a former senator. Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have raised the political stake. Tower did not restrain himself. Battling for the job, he said withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be damning the president's judgment. He said his nomination had been turned into a vehicle for a major presidential defeat. Tower's advocate on the Senate floor said grave constitutional issue were at stake, that the authority of the presidency wa on the line, that the Senate will come to rue the rule it wrote in the Tower decision. But Bush said all along that the outcome, either way, would not hurt on other issue. Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed. He told his Georgia constituent that the Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's leadership. In Washington, `triumphs' and `setbacks' are short-lived, Nunn said, and that's particularly true of the president. Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said. Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair condition, hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night. The senator is expected to make a full recovery. Tower, 63, a US. senator from Texas for 24 year, wa admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said. A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it wa benign, Habgood said, but further result would be announced Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr. RD. Dignan, of Dallas. Thursday's surgery took approximately three hour, Habgood said. When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also wa discovered and removed. Tests of that growth showed it to contain some malignant but well differentiated cell, Habgood said. Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who wa unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said. After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business a a defense consultant. He also served a an arm negotiator for President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra investigative panel. President-elect Bush designated Tower a his defense secretary on Dec. 16. The nomination is subject to Senate approval. Defense Secretary-designate John Tower contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his work for a British firm involved no military matter, according to report published Saturday. Meanwhile, new question were raised about the thoroughness of the FBI's background investigation of the embattled nominee. One newspaper reported that several bizarre accident, including early-morning car crash and a hotel fire, apparently were overlooked in the probe. The Senate Armed Services Committee ha put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it take a second look at Tower's personal habit, including his use of alcohol, and his link to defense contractor. Tower, who ha declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending, ha denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflict of interest concerning his business tie. A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined on Saturday to comment on the latest report, saying it's (the nomination) before the committee. Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, did not answer a reporter's call Saturday. In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower said he could recall no action in connection with any defense activity in connection with his work for the US. subsidiary of British Aerospace, Inc. That statement, according to two publication, The Los Angeles Times and the Legal Times, did not square with information which Tower provided to divorce attorney working for his second wife in June of 1987. In the divorce deposition, Tower said he went to work for British Aerospace eight week after resigning a the nation's chief strategic arm negotiator and advised the company on how to sell training jet, fighter plane and missile system to the Pentagon, the Los Angeles Times reported. Tower told the Senate committee he worked chiefly on selling commercial aircraft to US. airline and also advised the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuation. He said he earned $265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December. The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorney that he wa retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapon system to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapon involved. The deposition wa never filed in court because Tower did not contest the divorce, but a copy wa obtained by the FBI, the Legal Times said. It said it reporter were allowed by attorney to read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly. The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently ha not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbor, examine certain police record or investigate several car accident involving Tower. The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said the incident included an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when Tower wa trapped in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair. When fireman broke into his room to remove him, he wa reportedly in no condition to free himself, the Post said. The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two early-morning accident within week of one another in 1970, and, two year earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way home from work. The youth wa not seriously hurt. FBI spokesman Bill Carter refused comment on specific of the Tower investigation, but said We will follow any lead. On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that recent hospital test showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice President Dan Quayle said, I have never seen drinking being a factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine. Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there wa no question that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said: He is not an alcoholic. He's not had a drinking problem for year. Another victim wa Dr. Nicholas Davies, president-elect of the American College of Physicians, a 60,000-member industry group, said Dr. Louis Felder, who worked with Davies at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. None of the 20 passenger or three crew member aboard Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2311 survived.; The crash followed by one day the plane-helicopter collision that killed Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and six other people.; Tower, 65, and his daughter Marian, 35, boarded the 30-passenger, turboprop Embraer 120 in Atlanta and were headed to Sea Island, off the Georgia coast, for a party in Tower's honor.; Officials said they did not know the cause of the crash. The plane wa descending in clear weather, authority said, when it went down at 2:47 pm. about three mile northeast of the runway at the Brunswick-Glynco Jetport.; Witnesses said the plane appeared to have fallen straight from the sky.; ""It just went straight down. There wa no cropping of trees,"" said Lt. Jack Hopper of the Glynn County Police Department, quoting witnesses.; ""It started in on it nose, and I knew it wa in trouble,"" said James Griner, who life a quarter-mile from the airport. ""I went to the plane, but I couldn't get to it because of the fire. . . . When I got to it, it looked compacted.""; Atlantic Southeast's senior vice president, John Beiser, said official had no indication from the pilot that the flight wa in trouble.; Donald Day, the airline's manager of consumer affair, described the aircraft a ""extremely sophisticated and fuel-efficient, one of the backbone of our commuter fleet."" He said the plane wa new and had been put in service in December.; The Brazilian-made Embraer 120 is manufactured by Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA. In 1984, an Embraer 110 Bandeirante, an earlier model of the 120, crashed in Jacksonville, Fla., killing 13 people. The Federal Aviation Administration subsequently ordered an inspection of all Embraers for possible sheared or worn rivet in the tail sections.; Tower's death prompted word of grief and praise among his former colleague on Capitol Hill, even those who helped derail his elevation to the Cabinet in 1989.; ""I'm deeply saddened by the loss of John Tower, a tough, able friend and patriot,"" said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who broke rank with most Democrats to support President Bush's nomination of the 24-year Senate veteran to be defense secretary. ""He wa intelligent and had independence of judgment.""; Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who led the successful fight against Tower's confirmation, said: ""America had lost a patriot. . . . He fought for freedom and worked diligently to make the world more secure.""; ""It's so sad,"" Bush said. ""It is a tragic loss."" Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leader that Tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting. An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habit in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, like a ton of brick and wa a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination. The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friend not Tower alone had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch. After meeting with staff and adviser, Combest, who worked for then-Sen. Tower in the 1970s, issued a two-sentence statement supporting his fellow Texan. As a member of Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his ability to lead this country's armed force. In my judgment, John Tower will be a superb secretary of defense, the statement said. Combest spokesman Rich Adams refused to comment further, and said Combest wa not available to speak to reporter. The Washington Post reported that Combest described for Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, Tower's heavy drinking bout in the 1970s. A congressional source wa quoted a saying that Combest told the senator that Tower would drink a much a a full bottle of scotch two or three time a week. Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, told the Post that Combest originally went to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol. Boyd also told the Post that a group of people drank the entire bottle of scotch, not Tower alone. That wa the account Combest gave the FBI following his talk with Nunn and Warner, the newspaper said. It said that in that account, Combest said that he had only seen Tower drunk on two or three occasion. Tower ha acknowledged that he drank excessively in the 1970s, but say he ha reduced his intake to wine with dinner. On Sunday, he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed a defense secretary. Combest, 43, worked for Tower for seven year, 1971-1978, a a legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy. Tower served in the Senate for 24 year, deciding not to seek re-election in 1984. He wa chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1981 through 1984. The committee, now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along party line last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject Tower's nomination. You would obviously expect Mr. Tower to say no, and he obliges: volubly and passionately. If that wa all there wa to ""Consequences,"" we could scan the dust jacket and invest our saving in local real estate. ""Consequences"" read a bit like a political Stephen King story a the small senator swelled into a Beltway monster. Politics never ha been for the squeamish, but the Tower controversy leaf a much more disagreeable taste than did the senator's caperings (which mostly took place in the '70s anyway). Were the writing le stiff and the narrative technique le choppy, ""Consequences"" might have been a classic case study of late 20th-century politics out of control. Given Mr. Tower's qualification for the job -- intelligence, patriotism and past chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee -- the nomination should have sailed through with flying color. Instead it sank like the Bismarck. Clearly and apparently to his surprise, Mr. Tower had made many enemy since his arrival in Washington in 1961, often rubbing even supporter the wrong way. The senator from the Lone Star State could be lordly, in his English-cut suit. Once, meeting with the editor of my newspaper which had backed him strongly, he thought nothing of tilting back in his chair, crossing his tiny, well-shod foot atop the conference table. When the Tower hearing opened, all manner of accusation came to public notice. The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claimed to have seen the senator consorting with A Lady Not His Wife. It wa reported that Mr. Tower had chased a secretary around his desk and had fondled woman at Bergstrom Air Force Base. The second wife, whom the senator had recently divorced, possessed a repertory of tale she cheerfully volunteered. At his hotel, Mr. Tower wa accorded that doubtful tribute to instant-celebrity status, the medium stakeout. The nominee issued fervent denials: He drank only wine, having long since sworn off scotch; he'd never chased secretaries; his service for defense-industry client had been proper and modest. None of the charge, at least on Mr. Tower's showing, proved to have the least substance. No use. Dirt is dirtier than purity is pure, a one of John O'Hara's character observes. Sen. Sam Nunn, Mr. Tower's successor a Armed Services Committee chairman, seemed initially to smile on the nomination; then the rumor mill started churning and he changed front. While endeavoring to look statesmanlike, Sen. Nunn leaned on moderate Democrats who would otherwise have supported Tower. Sen. Nunn made the campaign personal, say Mr. Tower -- vote for me or vote for him. Most Democrats, in the end, went with Sen. Nunn. What wa all this about? Morality? Mr. Tower suggests instead that Sen. Nunn, a presidential hopeful, discovered and seized an opportunity to show who wa really No. 1 on national defense. Sen. Nunn had every reason to know that the moral and ethical charge leveled at Mr. Tower, and investigated exhaustively by the FBI, were flimsy. Yet he waved them about anyway. When the medium retailed lurid and unsubstantiated story, Sen. Nunn pursed his lip like a Georgia Sunday-school superintendent and suggested that a drunken Mr. Tower might accidentally press the nuclear button. ""Sam Nunn,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""used the FBI inquiry to discredit me and to strike at the president of the United States. The essential chain of good judgment and goodwill broke down during my confirmation process."" Sen. Nunn ha company on Mr. Tower's dishonor roll. There is Sen. Ernest Hollings (""a study in arrogance and pomposity""), Sen. James Exon (""one of the most excessive regular boozer in the Senate"") and NBC's Andrea Mitchell (""the most viciously partisan reporter I've ever seen""), along with the Washington press corp. Sen. John Warner, a Republican, is depicted a falling all over himself to stay in good with Sen. Nunn. Mr. Tower feel, not without reason, that he wa arraigned on moral charge by cynical colleague and medium personage whom no one ever mistook for Southern Baptist deacon. ""I don't so much resent my rejection by the Senate,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""as the way it wa done."" ""Tower, you were lynched,"" Mike Wallace, the CBS correspondent, told him. Worse yet, the lynch mob remains at large. --- Mr. Murchison is a senior columnist for the Dallas Morning News. The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower a defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 day into his term. The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on Tower's drinking habit, behavior toward woman and his business dealing with defense contractor. It wa only the ninth time in 200 year that the Senate ha voted to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it ha done so early in a new administration. Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee. The Senate gallery were packed and virtually all senator were in their seat a the roll wa called. The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed, Quayle intoned after the vote. Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hour of debate when she became the sole Republican to declare her opposition. She said her most serious concern were over Tower's activity a a defense consultant after serving a an arm control negotiator. She also expressed doubt that he would pay enough attention to ensuring fairness for woman in the military. Tower's Republican defender began to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat, even before the roll wa called. Just moment ago I took a call from John Tower, said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. His head is high, his voice is strong, Warner said. He asked me to convey thanks in his word to the troop who rallied to his support. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relation between the Senate and President Bush. I know what's in my heart and in my mind, he told reporter. I want to directly, clearly and unambiguously say that this doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the president. Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an extraordinary six-month trial period a defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking. There wa no doubt about the outcome a the Senate went through the motion of debating the nomination through the final hour before the roll call. The last few undecided senator declared their position. Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., said he would vote against Tower. Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said he would support the nomination. Senators from both party credited Tower's defeat to the decision to oppose him made by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee. When he made his decision all the other Democrats wheeled in behind him, said Sen. John Chafee, R-RI. With the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, If necessary, we'll come up with a (new) candidate very rapidly. Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation a a replacement for Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. Scowcroft replied No when asked this morning if he wa in line for the Pentagon job. It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and the national security adviser, any number of congressman and senator and any number of other outside expert have candidate on the tip of their tongue, Fitzwater said. But the time ha not come, he added. The time will come a soon a the vote is completed. We will wait until then. The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and one Republican committed to vote against Tower or leaning strongly in that direction. It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats declared for Tower or leaning his way. Nevertheless, the White House said it wanted to see the nomination go all the way to a vote. Tower, meanwhile, reported for work at the Pentagon where he and his three daughter had coffee together. He then continued a review of various administration proposal. I hope and believe we can work together on important matter, Mitchell said. The tension of this issue will have no long-lasting effect on the relationship. I want to say from the bottom of my heart that I hope this will be the case. The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed wa dealt a crushing blow on Wednesday a a parade of previously undecided Democratic senator announced they would vote no. Only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said he would vote yes, joining just two other Democrats who have made that decision. Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., all said they would vote against Tower. Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaf him with the clear impression that Tower's personality change when he drink heavily, leading to a recklessness in the social sense entirely different from his behavior when sober.

8,d119i,"President Bush is expected to name a female career diplomat a US. ambassador to Nicaragua a that country prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro, according to informed source. The source said Thursday it is virtually certain the appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to Mozambique. They said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who take office Wednesday. They also said the administration is eager to have more woman in key post. Only rarely have US. ambassadorship in Latin America gone to woman. In choosing Ms. Wells, the administration passed over several male career diplomat with long experience in that region, said the source, who asked not to be identified. Ms. Wells, who wa born in Estonia, ha no prior experience in Latin America. Her personnel record indicates she speaks Spanish. Wells' name wa submitted to the White House by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the Managua post, and approval is considered 99.9 percent certain, one source said. The United States and Nicaragua have not had ambassador in each other's capital since July 1988. The Sandinista government expelled then-US. ambassador Richard Melton and seven other US. diplomat on the ground they were interfering in Nicaragua's internal affair. The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his subordinate from the Nicaraguan embassy here. But a new era in U.S.-Nicaraguan relation is expected to open with the inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President Daniel Ortega in election this February. Vice President Dan Quayle and a large congressional delegation are expected to represent Bush at her inaugural. The administration ha asked Congress for $300 million in assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be used for resettling Contra rebel. But the request ha been stalled by Senate Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe ha a greater claim on US. resource than Nicaragua. Wells' nomination a ambassador to Mozambique in 1986 encountered strong opposition from Senate conservative who held up the appointment for 11 month in protest against US. policy toward that country. The nomination finally wa approved in September 1987. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrilla opposed to Mozambique's Marxist government. Mozambique ha since moderated it policy and is now off the US. government's list of country under Marxist rule. The Bush administration is expected to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman a the first US. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two year, a US. official say. The administration had planned to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she ha been a target of conservative. The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro ha taken over after almost 11 year of rule by the leftist Sandinista party. Mrs. Chamorro face the demanding challenge of reviving Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long year of warfare. The United States ha had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July 1988. At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on ground they were interfering in the country's internal affair. The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight Nicaraguan envoy in Washington, including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann. Shlaudeman, who ha served a ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation. He retired from the foreign service a year ago but wa called back to duty last fall to serve a a State Department liaison with the Nicaraguan Contra rebel. Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, wa approached by a senior State Department official week ago about going to Managua but said he wa not interested. He told intimate he would agree to go only if asked personally by President Bush. When Bush telephoned him earlier this week, Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the US. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday. In addition to his ambassadorial post, Shlaudeman wa the top Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President Reagan. The US. official said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several of his conservative ally would not assure the administration that they would not delay Wells' nomination. When Wells wa nominated to be ambassador to Mozambique in late 1986, Helms and his colleague blocked her appointment for 11 month. They took the action a a mean of expressing opposition to the Reagan administration's friendship toward Mozambique's Marxist government. With the end of the Cold War, the UN. is playing an increasingly important role in working to resolve regional dispute. It ha led effort to end civil war in El Salvador and Cambodia, and it also helped monitor election in Namibia. Last Friday, during an unprecedented UN. Security Council meeting of head of state, President Bush reaffirmed the U.N.'s leading role in peacemaking. The assignment in India could be an important one. India and it neighbor Pakistan remain embroiled in a long, bitter feud that ha the potential of becoming one of the world's few remaining nuclear standoff. Mr. Pickering wa one of President Bush's first ambassadorial appointment. He served at the UN. during the time the administration wa involved in the delicate negotiation that led to the formation of the coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf War and the UN. sanction against Saddam Hussein's regime. But some senior State Department official have been irritated by what they call Mr. Pickering's propensity for the medium spotlight. During the 1980s, when the Reagan administration drew the line against communist-backed insurgence in Central America, Mr. Pickering played an active role in that effort a US. envoy to El Salvador. Mr. Perkins wa the US. ambassador to South Africa in 1986, when the US. imposed economic sanction against that nation's white-minority government to pressure it to end apartheid. Mr. Perkins, who is black, traveled widely across South Africa during this period, making sure he wa seen in black township, attending church service and funeral, a well a in white community. Mr. Pickering, reached over the weekend, refused to comment on his future plan, and Mr. Perkins couldn't be reached. Ronald I. Spiers, a veteran US. diplomat, will be the new undersecretary-general for General Assembly affair, the top-ranking American post at the world body, UN. official said Tuesday. Spiers wa ambassador to Pakistan from 1981-83 and ha served a ambassador to the Bahamas and Turkey. He replaces Joseph Verner Reed, a banker who served in the post from 1987 until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for the United States. Although Spiers' nomination a undersecretary-general for Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services had been an open secret for month, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced it wa effective a of Tuesday. Spiers, 64, is a career foreign service officer, most recently serving a undersecretary of state for management since 1983. Spiers ha been a member of the US. delegation to the United Nations; wa director of political affair for the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; and wa director of NATO Affairs for the State Department. From 1966-69, Spiers wa counselor for political affair in the US. Embassy in London. In 1969, he became assistant secretary of State in charge of the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. When the Bahamas became independent from Britain in 1973, Spiers became the first US. ambassador to that nation. He became charge d'affaires in London in 1974, and wa minister of the US. Embassy there until 1977, when he wa appointed ambassador to Turkey. In 1980 he returned to the State Department a director of Intelligence and Research, and wa appointed ambassador to Pakistan in 1981. Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real estate developer named by President Bush a US. ambassador to Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to Republican campaign since 1984, disclosure statement show. Gildenhorn, according to Senate source, is one of several Bush ambassadorial nominee who have been rated unqualified by the American Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of former high ranking diplomat, including all living former secretary of state. One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporter and contributor named to diplomatic post, Gildenhorn gave $100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee. The gift wa not subject to the disclosure requirement of the Federal Election Campaign Act. The 84 contribution made between 1984 and early this year by Gildenhorn and member of his immediate family are being used by Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP contributor are being given choice diplomatic post better reserved for Foreign Service professional. Gildenhorn said Friday he could not comment because he is in a confirmation process. A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an excellent candidate for an ambassadorship because of his solid background in law and management. It also cited another qualification. Mr. Gildenhorn ha been a strong Republican supporter being a member of the Eagles and Team 100, the State Department said. The Republican Eagles are contributor of $10,000 or more in a single year to the Republican National Committee, while Team 100 designates people who have donated $100,000 or more. Gildenhorn's political contribution are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which ha set a hearing on the nomination for this week. They totaled $14,675 in 1984, $17,000 in 1985; $25,469.97 in 1986; $25,250 in 1987; $104,350 in 1988; and $11,000 this year. The total: $197,74497. Additionally, his wife, Alma Lee, gave $20,125 over the six year, including $13,000 in 1988; his daughter, Carolyn, gave $2,000; his son, Michael, gave $4,050 and his father, Oscar Gildenhorn, gave $5,750. That brings the total contribution made by Gildenhorn and his family to the GOP to $229,669.97 since 1984. Gildenhorn gave $50,000 during the period to the Republican National Committee or to the Republican Eagles. He gave $2,500 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986 to the Fund for the American Future, a Bush political action committee and contributed the legal limit of $1,000 to the Bush campaign in 1987. Gildenhorn also gave thousand of dollar to Republican congressional candidate. Included were gift to the campaign of Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Bill Cohen, R-Maine; Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; John Warner, R-Va.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; and former Sen. Paula Hawkins, R-Fla. Gildenhorn, 59, is a senior partner in Brown, Gildenhorn and Jacobs, a law firm specializing in real estate. He is also president of the JBG Real Estate Associates and JBG Properties Inc. Gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of director of the Sovran Bank here. He is a graduate of the University of Maryland and Yale University Law School. Other ambassadorial nominee rated a unqualified by the American Academy of Diplomacy include Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala, nominated a ambassador to Spain; Melvin L. Sembler, a real estate executive in Florida named to be ambassador to Australia; and Della M. Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker named to be ambassador to New Zealand. No action ha been taken by the Senate on any of those nomination. According to Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who first raised the issue of political contribution, Zappala and Sembler each contributed more than $100,000 to Republican candidate and cause. Mrs. Newman served a chairman of the Washington state Bush for President committee. Ambassador David Popper, president of the Academy of Diplomacy, declined to confirm that Gildenhorn and the other three nominee had been rated a unqualified to become ambassador. But he said the academy doe offer such rating, making it judgment based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the requirement of the job. He said the nonpartisan academy ha no objection to political appointee a such but doe believe political nominee should be qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the United States abroad with dignity, respect and ability. Twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by Bush in the first six month of his administration have gone to non-professionals, many of them large contributor to Republican cause, committee source said. Sarbanes say the appointment are larding the diplomatic corp with amateur rewarded for purely political service. Political throwaway, Sarbanes call them. I think the time ha come, very frankly, to get off the money merry-go-round and ask some very difficult question, essentially about when extensive political contribution are going to be a sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination, Sarbanes told the committee last month. It's not true in every instance, but in most of these case you seem to have to be over the $100,000 mark in order to make the consideration list, Sarbanes said. Sarbanes say he is not against political ambassador a such, noting that many of them compiled distinguished record. It is not the political ambassador that are the problem, Sarbanes said. It is ambassador without qualification. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia a ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might embarrass the United States because of his penchant for making gross remark. The committee's vote wa 13-0 in favor of Secchia, a former Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry executive. The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., voted present, meaning they took no position. Pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper account containing the distasteful specific of Mr. Secchia's remark. At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged to be far more careful a a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role a a political organizer and enthusiast. But Pell said he wa unpersuaded. Tact and careful speech are hallmark of successful diplomat, Pell said. Mr. Secchia ha demonstrated that he would bring opposite quality to the position of ambassador to Italy. Italian friend of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their country, the chairman said. I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States, Pell said. But he said that since Secchia is the president's choice he would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it. President Bush ha named career diplomat Deane Hinton a ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday. Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, who wa recalled by Bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian election last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Bush sent Davis back to Panama City after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by US. force and installation of Guillermo Endara a president. Independent observer mostly concluded Endara had won the election by a hefty margin. Bush named Hinton a a recess appointment because Congress is not in session. That mean Hinton can serve until the end of next year before he must go before the Senate for confirmation. The appointment of the 66-year-old Hinton, with his long expierience on Latin American issue, is seen a a signal of the importance Bush is placing on restoring normal relation with Panama. Those relation steadily deteriorated after the United States indicted Noriega, once a ally particularly of the US. intelligence community, on drug trafficking charge in Florida. Hinton ha been ambassador to Costa Rica since 1987. Before that he wa ambassador to Pakistan from 1983 to 1987, and ambassador to El Salvador from 1981 to 1983. He wa assistant secretary of state for economic and business affair from 1979 to 1981, and before that US. representative to the 12-nation European Community, headquartered in Brussels, a State Department adviser on economic affair, and director and economic counselor of the State Department's Agency for economic Development in Chile and in Guatemala. Davis, a former State Department consultant and former ambassador to Paraguay, wa sent to Panama by President Reagan in 1986. Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time wa appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama, said one administration official. Officials described Hinton a an experienced Latin America hand and a good person to have in place with the volatile development in the South American country. On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Hinton highly qualified for the post because of his wide-ranging experience and expertise in Central America. However, Mitchell said he hoped Bush would send the appointment to the Senate after Congress convenes Jan. 23 despite the nature of the recess appointment.

9,d115i,"Police bulldozed unstable brick and mud house today while those left homeless by an earthquake that killed at least 749 people sought shelter and awaited government aid. Casualty report continued to trickle in from remote part of this Himalayan mountain kingdom a relief worker fanned out through the foothill and valley. Sunday's pre-dawn quake struck near the India-Nepal border. Some road were flooded by heavy rain that followed the quake. Others had crack three foot deep or were blocked by boulder the size of house. At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa of the Home Affairs Ministry. Dharan wa hardest hit. At least 131 body were found in the city of 100,000. Indian official have maintained since Monday that the death toll in their country wa 200 or le, but the figure wa questioned by opposition politician, survivor and the local medium, including the Times of India, a newspaper that generally support the government. They put the India death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500. Indian official said 200 people were injured in the quake. Nepalese official listed 752 injured, down from their earlier estimate of 1,000. In Bhaktapur, a city of 50,000 where seven people died in the quake, 63-year-old Nhuchhe Raj Sakya said his five-story brick and mud house had nearly fallen down but that he and his family of 10 were still living in it. What else can we do? the goldsmith said. We have no tent. How can I leave my place? Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan on Tuesday and surveyed heap of brick that were once three-story and five-story house. This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal, Shrestha said a he toured the town. Dharan, 105 mile southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plain at the base of a steep hill. Most of the victim died in their house, which were made of brick held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rain. Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozer have demolished more than 50 house deemed too dangerous for habitation. We will continue to demolish house until we are satisfied (the one remaining) are safe to live in, he said. Adhikari said local official had not yet heard from the government on compensation or new housing for people whose home were demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbor or found shelter in tent erected on the soggy earth. The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and wa the deadliest quake in the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' account. Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's quake, and rumor of an impending new quake sent thousand of people fleeing into the street in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan. The rumor started with anonymous telephone call and spread by word of mouth. In Dharan, men ran from house to house rousing people from their sleep. Rescuers searched through debris today for victim of an earthquake that ravaged one-third of this country's territory and part of India, killing at least 650 people and injuring thousand. The death toll wa expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawn quake on the India-Nepal border, which triggered landslide and flood and wa the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 year. Officials in both country said they had yet to receive report from the remote Himalayan area hardest hit by the temblor, which knocked out power and communication and wa said to injure at least 3,000 people. Niranjan Thapa, Nepal's minister of state for home affair, told a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1,000 injured. He said official expected the number to climb. Indian official reported at least 200 people dead and more than 2,000 injured, most by debris from collapsing building. The quake, centered almost on the India-Nepal border, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale. Indian television today showed the devastation in the Indian state of Bihar: crumbled building, makeshift morgue lined with row of body wrapped in white shroud, damaged hospital ward packed with survivor. Medical team in India carried medicine and other supply to overcrowded hospital and the army wa deployed to help search for victim. But the monsoon, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually last through September, hampered relief operation. Nepal's Thapa told a news conference that the rain have been a great hindrance in carrying out rescue work. Access to some area of this mountain country is impossible. He said 21 of the kingdom's 75 district suffered extensive damage. The hardest hit appeared to be Dharan, a sparsely populated border region where Thapa said at least 131 people died. Bir Bahadur Shahi, secretary of the home affair ministry, flew to eastern Nepal on Sunday. He said 50,000 to 60,000 house were destroyed in the Dharan district alone. Ninety percent of the remaining house are cracked, Shahi said, adding that most of the damage wa to modern house of stone and older house from mud and brick. Wooden house were not affected, he said. Many people were given shelter in school, guesthouse and public building, but most of the people do not want to leave their home, Shahi said. He said water supply were still adequate and there were no report of disease breaking out. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi flew to Bihar to tour some of the hardest hit area. The government said it would release a detailed report after he returned to the capital tonight. Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha of Nepal visited some of the victim at Bir Hospital in his capital, Katmandu. The quake roused people from their sleep in Bihar and nine other Indian state and central and eastern Nepal. It lasted about a minute and aftershock continued for about an hour. Rail track sank into the soggy ground and bridge over rising river cracked, paralyzing train service and road travel in many part of the devastated area. Parts of northern Bangladesh and the capital, Dhaka, also felt the tremor. There were report that 50 people were injured, most by jumping from their house during the quake. Witnesses in Darbhanga, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 mile south of the epicenter, said the only warning were hissing sound, rattling door and cracking window. Women began blowing conch shell, following an ancient tradition believed to appease the weather god. More than 25,000 house were flattened in Darbhanga, a well a the district of Munger and Madhubani, Indian official said. In Madhubani, the Bhootahi Balan River jumped it bank and flooded nearly 50 village. Officials said at least 45 people died, but it wa not known whether the death were due to flood or collapsing house. It wa the worst quake to strike the region in 38 year. A temblor rumbled through the Indian state of Assam on the India-China border in August 1950. Official account said more than 1,500 people died, but seismologist said their record showed 30,000 were killed. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, a measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number mean the ground motion is 10 time greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated area. Rescue worker coped with aftershock and heavy rain today in an effort to reach remote region of the Himalayas to help victim of an earthquake whose official death toll neared 700. Rumors predicting another large quake sent thousand of panic-stricken people fleeing from their home in India and Nepal. Sunday's pre-dawn quake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and claimed at least 497 life in Nepal and 200 in India, government official said. Officials in both country said they expected the death toll to climb when report arrived from region difficult to reach even in good weather.

In Biratnagar, a city near the Indian border 150 mile east of the Nepalese capital Katmandu, resident poured into the street before dawn today a men ran from house to house, shouting that a message came from Katmandu that a new quake wa expected before dawn. Police in the city of 300,000 people said they received no such message. I have tried to tell them they are making a mistake, but no one will listen to me, said Dabal Singh, an inspector. Anonymous telephone call with similar rumor roused hundred of people in Katmandu, also before dawn. Sunday's quake wa felt in the capital, but no death or serious damage were reported in the city. In Patna, India, thousand of people huddled in the rain in open courtyard Monday a rumor swept the city that another quake wa imminent.

He said most aftershock had declined to a reading of 1 on the Richter scale. Rain continued in quake-affected area, hampering access on muddy road already cracked by the quake. Landslides blocked many road to devastated area. Railroad track sank into the mud, and the quake also cracked bridge over river swollen by the monsoon. In India, the area with the greatest damage and casualty wa just south of the border in Bihar, India's poorest state. News report said 400 people died in Bihar state, double the Indian government's count. Bihar official said the report were exaggerated, while opposition politician in the state accused the government of suppressing information and claimed the death toll wa close to 1,500. Tremors flattened more than 25,000 house in India, official said, and the Bhoothai Balan River flooded nearly 50 village in the Madhubani district. Indian army soldier helped with relief effort, and the navy and air force were put on alert. Nepalese soldier, police and volunteer joined force in the kingdom's remote mountain and valley.

The quake wa the worst in the region since a temblor in India's eastern state of Assam killed 1,500 people in 1950, according to official account. Seismologists said their record showed a death toll of at least 30,000. The Richter scale measure ground motion a recorded on seismograph and each number represents aa tenflod increaase in intensity. A quake of 6 on the scale is capable of causing severe damage, while one measuring 5 can cause considerable damage.

If God is pleased, nothing will happen, said one woman, who refused to give her name. The earthquake, which struck shortly before daybreak Sunday when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale. It wa the deadliest quake in the region since 1950 when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' account.

A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated area while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage. The death toll from the Himalayan earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday a rescue worker hampered by monsoon rain, aftershock and washed out road reached remote area of Nepal and found more body. In eastern India, which also wa devastated by the quake, crack were found in the embankment of six river in Bihar state, and official said flood could pose the next threat to the 10 million people. It may be the second coming. All the river are in full spate, and if the embankment breach, we are in for serious problem, said Puranman Mittal, the relief commissioner in Bihar state, which suffered the most damage in India. Bihar resident ran screaming through the street on Wednesday when a mild tremor rumbled through the area.

This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal, Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha, said Tuesday after a tour of devastated area in his nation. At least 758 people died and 950 were injured in both country Sunday when the earthquake jolted the mountainous India-Nepal border region. It wa the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since 1950, when, by official count, 1,500 people were killed in the eastern Indian state of Assam. Indian official said Wednesday that at least 196 died in India in Sunday's disaster. Officials in Nepal said at least 562 people were killed in Nepal, including 31 people whose body were found in remote area on Wednesday. In India's Bihar state, official said the water had reached dangerous level and wa still rising in six rivers: the Ganges, the Ghagara, the Burigandak, the Bagmati, the Koshi and the Mahananada. To make matter worse, survey team found crack in the embankment of the six river, which are swollen by monsoon rain that began in late June. Engineers tried to strengthen the weakened embankment with cement, and helicopter made aerial survey watching for rupture. As survivor in both country began rebuilding home damaged or destroyed by the quake, medicine, food and financial aid began arriving from abroad. Elroy J. Carlson, an official at the US. Embassy in Katmandu, said the United State offered $25,000 in aid. In New Delhi, US. Ambassador John Gunther Dean presented the government with a similar amount for Indian victim. Michael Hamilton, an official at the British Embassy in Katmandu, said three medical team had been sent to Dharan. The team are carrying two truckloads of blood and medicine, Hamilton said. The British army also run a military hospital in Dharan, where at least 100 people were admitted. The government hospital in Dharan treated hundred of people injured when brick and wood house collapsed. UN. agency and the Red Cross also sent medical team to Nepal, and the government began distributing 90-pound bag of rice. The relief effort were hampered in both country by heavy rain which cut off communication and road link to several of the affected area. The earthquake hit a wide area, and it is a big job to reach the remote village. But we are trying, said Mittal, the relief official in Bihar state. An earthquake that devastated part of Nepal and India earlier this week ha killed more than 980 people, official from the two country said Friday. Mourners paraded through the street of this medieval town, calling for revenge after a former legislator wa beaten to death by political rival while he wa distributing relief supply to earthquake victim. Hang the murderer, score of young men chanted a they marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of Karna Hyanju, once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed Communist Party. Witnesses said Hyanju wa beaten with umbrella and stick late Thursday afternoon, then dragged through the street for nearly two hour before police intervened. He died Friday at the Bir hospital in Katmandu, 7 mile west of Bhaktapur. Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blanket, milk and other food in Bhaktapur when he wa accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supply only to his own supporter. Reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from remote part of Nepal on Friday, and the Home Affairs Ministry updated it confirmed death toll to 704. In India, the official count rose to 277. But survivor, the news medium and opposition politician say the toll could be a high a 1,500. Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, which record energy released by a tremor according to ground motion measured by a seismograph. A reading of 6 indicates the possibility of severe damage, while 7 signifies a major quake. Dhaubanjar said he saw about 40 people rounded up by police Thursday night after Hyanju's beating death. He said many belonged to the same Communist faction that Hyanju once supported. People started beating him with umbrella, Dhaubanjar said. There were a lot of scratch on his body, and a lot of blood. It looked like one ear wa missing. Then they made a necklace of their shoe (by tying the lace together), put it around his neck and pulled him through the street. As Hyanju's body wa taken through the winding street of Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temple, thousand of the town's 50,000 people jammed street, temple step and the balcony of brick and mud house. Pashupati Rana, one of several Cabinet minister who marched in the funeral procession, said several people were arrested in the killing, including the mayor, the deputy mayor and a member of the Rashtriya Panchayat, or non-partisan assembly. Rana, who is minister of local development and legislative, affair, called Hyanju's death political murder. Hyanju served in the Panchayat from 1981 until 1986 when he lost the backing of the Communists in Bhaktapur, traditionally a leftist stronghold. The Panchayat, whose member are elected on non-party line, wa created after the late king Mahendra abolished the old Parliament and all political party in 1960, saying a Western-style parliamentary system wa not suited to his mountain kingdom. Dhaubanjar and a group of young men who gathered around him said Hyanju wa perceived a a government supporter despite his previous communist leaning.

10,d102e,"The actor who played Little Ricky on the I Love Lucy show said Wednesday he spent more time with Lucille Ball than he did with his own family in the five year he played the comedian's TV son. Miss Ball died of a ruptured aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Wednesday morning, hospital official said. She wa 77. She wa old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so I wa not shocked by her death, said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age 6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world. I'm sure all this is going to hit me a little later on. Thibodeaux grew up on the set, playing Little Ricky from 1956 until 1961 under Miss Ball's watchful eye. I think the thing I remember most about Lucy wa that she wa very much in control of everything, said Thibodeaux, who began playing the drum at age 2, wa a professional drummer at age 4 and is now drummer with David and the Giants, a Christian rock group. He life in Jackson with his wife, Kathy, a ballerina. Thibodeaux, 38, said he got his break in show business when big band leader Horace Heidt persuaded his father to bring him from Lafayette, La., to California for the Swift Premium Hour, a traveling radio show that led to a string of one-night stand across the country. That led to an audition for the I Love Lucy role in Hollywood. I remember Lucy saying, `that's him,' and from that time I wa Little Ricky, said Thibodeaux, who then used the name Richard Keith. I signed a seven-year contract with the studio in 1956 and the first episode I wa in wa aired that December with Bob Hope I just turned 6. Thibodeaux said that during the series' run he spent a much time with Miss Ball a with his own family in Lafayette. And I spent more time with her off the set at her home than at the studio, he said. I remember her a very strict but with a lot of love. She had her way but despite all, she wa a great person, very, very talented. I know everybody remembers her a zany and wacky but that wa only on the show. Actually, she wa just the opposite and wa very serious. . That's what made her a great actress. He said Miss Ball often gave him gift and that he remembers spending at least one Christmas at her home. I remember she once gave me an Indian tepee, then my own dressing room, he said. She gave me bicycle and an identical set of drum. As a young girl in western New York, Lucille Ball hawked hot dog and popcorn at an amusement park a she dreamed of starring in movie, hometown friend recalled. She always talked about being a star, said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her. Miss Ball, born 60 mile south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug. 6, 1911, grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake. Mrs. Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday a daring in many way. She tried to get me to run off (to Broadway), Mrs. Lopus added. But I didn't have the nerve. At 15, Miss Ball worked a a barker at the amusement park, screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dog until she lost her voice. Later, she starred in high school play and got her start in front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct Palace Theater in Jamestown. Although Miss Ball hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had no family there, she stayed in touch with friend. Even though she wa a big star, she wa still just Lucy to u, said Irene Rosseti of Celoron. Mrs. Rosseti said Miss Ball recently sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary. Miss Ball regularly donated money to charity, civic event and Jamestown Community College, said Jamestown Mayor Steven Carlson. On May 20, Miss Ball wa to receive an honorary degree from the college and had planned to return to Jamestown, now a city of about 40,000. Residents had put up poster saying Jamestown Loves Lucy in storefront and home window. After Miss Ball suffered a heart attack last week, resident decided to sign the poster and send them to her a a get-well greeting. More than 150 poster were sent with 10,000 signature. The 77-year-old comedian died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she wa recovering from last week's emergency heart surgery. It is a sad day for all of u, said Nelson Garifi, an organizer of the welcoming event. But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world. Garifi, community relation director for the community college, said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously. Future generation in Celoron will have a reminder of their famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where she grew up it will be renamed Lucy Lane. Village official had planned formal ceremony renaming the street when she wa due in the area next month. But it will happen anyway, John Goodell of the village's historical society said Wednesday. When the society wa formed about a year ago, Goodell said: We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership. It wa a check written in a very bold hand with a signature about a half inch high. Bob Thomas ha covered Hollywood for The Associated Press for 45 year. Thousands of Lucille Ball's fan shed tear for the woman who made them laugh, a three city held memorial service in which the redheaded comedian wa remembered with prayer and applause. She wa a whole package. There never will be another one like her. I love her, said a tearful Carol Burnett following a memorial Mass in suburban Santa Monica. More than a thousand people who packed the St. Monica's Catholic Church rose to their foot and clapped for several minute after television minister the Rev. Robert Schuller asked them to applaud the Lord for Lucille Ball. About 1,000 people also crowded a church in New York and 200 gathered in a Chicago church. All three memorial Masses began at 8 pm. Monday, the time Miss Ball's three most popular program were often broadcast. The 77-year-old comedian who starred in one of television's biggest all-time hit, I Love Lucy, died here April 26 of a ruptured aorta, a major blood vessel, eight day after emergency open-heart surgery. Miss Ball, known for her honed comedic timing, wide-mouthed expression and wacky antic, wa popular among generation of fan who watched I Love Lucy a a first-run show in the '50s and in three decade of rerun. She showed her love in the only way she knew how, by making you laugh, the Rev. James Fox told those gathered for the Roman Catholic Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola in New York. Broadcaster Diane Sawyer told the crowd that the death of Miss Ball may have settled a longstanding theological debate over whether there is laughter in heaven. A God who would have created her would never let her laughter be far from Him, said Ms. Sawyer. In Chicago, the Rev. Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick Church that God gave the world talent like Miss Ball to show u life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending. She taught u that if we could love Lucy, we could love ourselves, Wall said. In announcing the service, Miss Ball's family said: Monday night wa the time when most of the nation wa used to being with Lucy. Two of the three long-running comedy show in which Miss Ball starred, The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy, aired Monday night. I Love Lucy had starting time on Mondays and other day. Lucille Ball gave the gift of humor which produced happiness, said Schuller at the Santa Monica service. Only God know how many husband and wife weren't speaking and then Monday night rolled around. Fans lined up to get in the Santa Monica church a much a four hour early. Florists delivered arrangement including a 3-foot heart of red carnation with the word I Love Lucy written across. Hundreds of people came forward during Holy Communion to receive blessing from three priest, including a woman wearing an I Love Lucy T-shirt. I think she would have loved it very much, and she lived her life for the people who were in that room tonight, said Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Miss Ball and the late Desi Arnaz. Gary Morton, Miss Ball's husband for more than two decade, attended a private service for his wife last month. The actress' remains were buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills. Bob Hope keep voluminous file, including the joke he delivered and people he ha performed with, and his first entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a show called GI. Journal. I really can't remember many detail about it, said Hope, who pay tribute to his frequent co-star in an NBC special Saturday night. It's called Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball. She died in April of this year. That first time together wa followed by four movie, frequent visit by Hope on I Love Lucy and regular appearance by Lucy on his television show. Lucy wa a very funny woman, Hope said. Even in private she could get off a great ad lib. But it's hard to compare her with other funny woman. It's like asking who's the best golfer. You have to go to the record. I don't think anyone ever had the success she had. She certainly hold the most record. A secretary dug the detail of that first joint appearance out of one of two vault where Hope keep everything pertaining to his long comic career. There are written record of all his show, copy of all the script, monologue and comic routine, audio tape of his radio show and thousand of other memento. GI. Journal wa on May 4, 1945. Hope's file reads: Spot: Lucille Ball . English play . For Charity Bazaar. Hope and Ball had actually known each other before they began working together. In fact, the late Desi Arnaz, her then husband, worked for Hope first. He said Ball asked him nearly 50 year ago to find a place on his popular radio show for band leader Arnaz. Stan Kenton wa leaving a my orchestra leader, Hope said. I gave Desi a spot on my show. We also gave him some line to speak. Every time he walked up to the microphone he dropped an enchilada. He could hardly talk, let alone get a laugh. When they started `I Love Lucy,' I said, `What's going on? This man is funny.' The night before she died I performed at the Music Center, he said. Lucy wa in the hospital and I saw her daughter, Lucie Arnaz, and said, `Isn't it wonderful she's doing better.' They called me the next day and said she had died. I said, `God ha her now, but we'll have her forever.' We'll be watching her performance for a long, long time. Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucy will include clip from their movie and TV appearance, plus such guest star a Betty White, George Burns and Danny Thomas. I'm going through everything myself picking out the clip, Hope said. The last time she wa on my show wa my birthday show two year ago. We sang `I Remember It Well.' Our last time together in public wa at the Academy Awards in March. I think I'll do my tribute to her over a shot of that in the background. I think everyone remembers that. She wa on his radio show on May 27, 1947, at Detroit. The program note say, Lucille Ball: New York, clothes, car, picture. I could do a fashion show with her walking on stage, Hope said of the show clip he had been watching in preparing the special. She had great gown and hairdo. When she performed she would use different style. She'd change the way she read a line. She'd throw a line away one time, then she'd turn around and milk a line for laugh. Hope recalled his funny co-star in a sunny alcove in the living room of his Los Angeles home. It overlook the one-hole golf course in the back yard, and he wa attired in golfing clothes. Occasionally, he called his office in another building on the ground to check on a piece of information. Soon after the interview, he wa aboard a plane for a series of personal appearance around the country. Ball made 22 appearance on Hope's special and he wa on her show 10 or 12 time, he said. In their first movie, Sorrowful Jones in 1949, Hope played a racetrack bookie who's forced to become the foster father of a young girl whose real father wa killed by gangster in a racehorse fix. Ball wa a nightclub singer who help him look after the girl. It wa a remake of Little Miss Marker, which starred Shirley Temple in 1934. Next wa Fancy Pants in 1950, a remake of Ruggles of Red Gap. Ball played a rich rancher who acquires an English butler, played by Hope. Facts of Life wa in 1960, with Hope and Ball a married lover who have a tryst. Their last film wa Critic's Choice in 1963, in which Hope is a Broadway critic who ha to review a play written by his wife, played by Ball. Someone reminded me the other night of a bus tour we did of movie theater in New York to promote one our of picture, he said. I think it wa `Critic's Choice.' I found her very cooperative, very wonderful. We always had a lot of fun together. Lucille Ball, the daffy comedian whose harebrained scheme drove her television family crazy but delighted viewer for four decade, died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery. She wa 77. The actress, star of the hugely popular I Love Lucy and related situation comedy seen in more than 80 country, had undergone major heart surgery April 18. She had been recovering steadily, getting out of bed and joking with the staff, but shortly before dawn Wednesday, she went into cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived, said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ronald Wise. She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 am. and 47 minute of resuscitation effort proved fruitless, Wise said. There wa nothing to indicate this would happen, Wise said. The heart itself apparently wa not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death. In the 6{-hour surgery at Cedars-Sinai, doctor replaced her aorta and aortic valve. Although the replaced portion of Miss Ball's aorta did not apparently fail, the entire artery wa in poor condition when she wa operated upon, said Dr. Robert Kass. Kass, who performed the operation, said at the time the tearing in Miss Ball's aorta progressed all the way down into her abdomen. Miss Ball, with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail, wa considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format. I and 100 million others will miss her, said comedian George Burns. But we haven't lost Lucille Ball because she's still with u on television and we can see her on and on. Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter. But she also embodied an even greater treasure the gift of love, President Bush said in a statement. She appealed to the gentler impulse of the human spirit. She wa not merely an actress or comedienne. She wa Lucy and she wa loved. Her red hair, her antic on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution, former President and Nancy Reagan said in a statement. Just the mention of her name brings a smile. . We love Lucy and will miss her deeply. It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 year, said Miss Ball's frequent sidekick, Gale Gordon, who wa in Edmonton, Alberta. While in the hospital, the comedian wa deluged with thousand of card, letter, flower and phone call from fan a far away a Australia and Europe. Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in I Love Lucy from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated rerun. The late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbor, Fred and Ethel Mertz. Her split-second timing, wide-mouthed wail and exaggerated pratfall made the I Love Lucy show one of the most popular in television history. Bridge club and bowling team changed their meeting night to watch Lucy and Ethel cook up still another ridiculous scheme that would push their long-suffering husband to exasperation. Miss Ball's real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewer more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky. The real birth occurred just four hour before the previously-filmed show wa broadcast. Miss Ball's singularity a a comedian wa matched by her talent a a show-business entrepreneur. She and Arnaz established one of TV's first major independent studio. Desilu, a their production company wa called, made some of the top comedy show of the 1950s and '60s, including December Bride, Our Miss Brooks and Make Room for Daddy. As testament to their value a prime-time star, Miss Ball and Arnaz signed an $8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953 the largest in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch today. The couple stopped making weekly I Love Lucy show in 1957. Despite rich and two child, Lucie and Desi Jr., their marriage foundered, and the couple divorced in 1960. In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic Gary Morton, who became her executive producer, and remained on TV for 12 more year in the weekly Here's Lucy and The Lucy Show. Miss Ball wa born Aug. 6, 1911, in Jamestown, N.Y., the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist. Young Lucy, a brunette, wa dazzled by the stage, but her ambition were discouraged by an acting school They sent my mother a letter saying she wa wasting her money, Miss Ball once said and she turned to modeling under the name Diane Belmont. Her ad for Chesterfield cigarette caught Hollywood's eye, and in 1933 she went to California. As a blonde, she appeared with the Marx Brothers in Room Service, with Fred Astaire in Follow the Fleet and with Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in Stage Door. In all, she appeared in more than 75 movie. In 1940, her tress colored the fiery trademark red, Miss Ball met Arnaz, a rumba star. They married within six month. In 1951, when CBS decided to move her radio series, My Favorite Husband, to television, Miss Ball insisted that Arnaz be her co-star. But the network wasn't sure Arnaz would be a hit with the American public. The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved audience would watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born band leader with a heavy accent. They also produced their own pilot episode on borrowed money. CBS relented, and I Love Lucy wa an immediate success. The show revolutionized television sitcom production in the day before videotape. It wa filmed in advance before a live audience, employing three camera instead of the traditional one used for motion picture. The actress wa last seen at the 61st Academy Awards ceremony March 29, where the svelte actress received a standing ovation and laughed freely throughout her brief bit with Bob Hope. Her last series Life with Lucy, once again co-starring Gordon wa carried by ABC at the start of the 1986 season. But the show, her first series in 12 year, wa canceled after le than two month when it drew spectacularly low rating. She felt terrible. . It really devastated her, daughter Lucie Arnaz said at the time. Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 TV movie Stone Pillow, considered one of the most challenging role of her career. She wa hospitalized for dehydration when it wa over, but the movie wa a minor critical and rating success. Just this month, Miss Ball had signed a deal for a reported $750,000 with Putnam to publish her autobiography. Said CBS Chairman William Paley: Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS. . Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our life is a legacy that will last forever. Funeral arrangement were pending. An outpouring of sympathy from president to childhood neighbor followed the death of Lucille Ball, but many said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television rerun and her influence on comedy. The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained scheme drove her television family crazy and delighted viewer for four decade died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She wa 77 and died eight day after emergency heart surgery. A private burial wa planned, reportedly with no funeral service in accordance with Miss Ball's wish. God ha her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her forever, said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope. Hospital switchboard were swamped with condolence call and thousand of card after Miss Ball's death, spokesman Ron Wise said. Miss Ball's family requested that any flower sent to the Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patient. Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she wa critically ill. Following her operation last week, her first word to her daughter, Lucie, were: Wouldn't you know this is the day I wa going to get my hair done. Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so her death came a a shock. She had been walking, her spirit were up. Her family wa with her, Wise said. She responded a well a anyone could respond to that kind of surgery. He said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden pain in her back, and in a matter of second went into a full cardiac arrest that wa caused by a ruptured aorta. Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in I Love Lucy from 1951 to 1957. In the ground-breaking show, still seen in syndication worldwide, the late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbor, Fred and Ethel Mertz. Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do, said actress-comedian Jane Curtin, star of the sitcom Kate and Allie. But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her show. The show, one of the most popular in television history, wa distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced expression, wide-mouthed wail and extravagant pratfall. Working with Lucy wa like receiving an MA. or a PhD. in comedy, recalled Joan Rivers. What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of u will ever learn in a lifetime. Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said: Lucy wa great because she represented every person. She showed u human foible and gave u a chance to laugh at ourselves. Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the I Love Lucy character to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant. That wa how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant, Miss Goldberg said. She wa looking at him in a compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously. And that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy. Bob Rosati, who life down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he wa watching a rerun of I Love Lucy on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the word In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989 appeared. I felt I had lost someone in my family. I couldn't believe it, said Rosati, 40. I wa watching Lucy like I do every morning. She's one of the most-admired lady in this town. He wa among a group of fan who stood reverently outside Miss Ball's home on Roxbury Drive a florist delivered basket of flower to the house. Tour van passed by in a non-stop procession. On Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flower arrangement were placed on Miss Ball's two star one for her film work, one for television. Budd Friedman, owner of the Improvisation comedy club, said, The world of comedy ha lost it first lady. Her death is an irreparable loss . to our industry. Actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series Taxi. It made it like it had been blessed, he recalled. Admirers included President Bush, in Southern California at the time of Miss Ball's passing, and former President Reagan. Her red hair, her antic on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution, the former president and Nancy Reagan said in a statement. Just the mention of her name brings a smile. . We love Lucy and will miss her deeply. Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter, Bush said. But she also embodied an even greater treasure the gift of love. She appealed to the gentler impulse of the human spirit. She wa not merely an actress or comedienne. She wa Lucy and she wa loved. To baby boomer, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing, said Saturday Night Live comedian Victoria Jackson, who wa born two year after I Love Lucy went off the air a a regular series. She didn't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life. Said comic Tim Conway: We're going to miss this lady, but not really, because she's still here. All those wonderful thing they did together . those wonderful TV show . are still available. Although Miss Ball hadn't visited her hometown of Jamestown, N.Y, since 1956 and had no family there, she had stayed in touch with friend. Irene Rosseti, who now life in Celoron, N.Y., said Miss Ball recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary. Even though she wa a big star, she wa still just Lucy to u, she recalled. Lucille Ball wa mourned Wednesday by the western New York hometown she left for Hollywood more than half a century ago. It is a sad day for all of u. But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world, said Nelson Garifi, organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that wa to have been held next month. She wa always so full of life, said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her. It seemed like she would just go on forever. The 77-year-old comedian died of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she wa recovering from emergency heart surgery last week. The American Heart Association's Jamestown office wa deluged with call from Miss Ball's fan who wanted to make a memorial donation, official said. We just can't process a many memorial a we've received, said office manager Nathan Lax. Miss Ball wa born Aug. 6, 1911, in this city of 40,000 people about 60 mile south of Buffalo, the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist. She grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake. Friends said some of the characteristic of her most famous role the zany, excitable star of television's I Love Lucy were evident during her childhood. Mrs. Lopus said Miss Ball dreamed of fame, either a a dramatic actress in New York City or a a dancing girl in musical. At age 15, she worked a a barker at a local amusement park, screaming pitch for popcorn and hot dog until she lost her voice. In high school, she starred in high school play and made her first appearance before a large audience at the now-defunct Palace Theater here. As a model, she caught Hollywood's eye and in 1933, she wa off to Hollywood.

The honorary degree will be awarded posthumously, said Garifi, who is community relation director at the college. Celoron had planned to rename a street in Miss Ball's honor during her visit, and still plan to rename it a Lucy Lane, said John Goodell of Celoron's Historical Society. Goodell said that when the group wa formed about a year ago, We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership. Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of Lucille Ball from radio day who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself a particularly funny. Oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face, the 83-year-old Gordon said in a telephone interview. She never saw it, but she wa extremely amusing. Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend. The world will miss her greatly, the actor said. I personally will remember her a the best talent of her kind in the world . a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius the only one I've ever really known. In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon wa the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in The Lucy Show from 1962-68. The next six year saw him a Harrison Carter on Here's Lucy. They were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived Life With Lucy. Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program My Favorite Husband, which later became I Love Lucy on television. I thought she wa a very good-looking young woman, and very talented, he recalled. She wa very pleasant to work with. None of u knew what wa going to happen television wa very young then and it wasn't taken too seriously. We never dreamed it would ever become the power it wa . and the great star it would produce. Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday, Feb. 20, when she called to wish me a happy birthday a she ha done for year and year. Gordon ha done regular stint for year at a chain of Edmonton-based dinner theatre called Stage West. He is currently appearing with that company's Mayfair Dinner Theatre a a priest in the play Mass Appeal. The play ha another month to run and Gordon say that mean he won't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral. I couldn't do that because it would put people out of work, he said.

11,d108g,"Hitting Baghdad where it hurt, more country have joined a U.N.-sanctioned boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait. On Tuesday, country ranging from powerful Japan to neutral Switzerland to tiny Cyprus cut off petroleum import in an effort to convince the Baghdad government to withdraw it troop that invaded Kuwait on Thursday. Turkey announced it wa shut down the twin Iraqi oil pipeline that run through it to the Mediterranean carrying half of Baghdad's crude output and cutting off trade with Iraq. Baghdad's only other major pipeline exporting crude run through Saudi Arabia, where the flow ha been drastically reduced. The UN. Security Council on Monday voted to impose broad economic sanction against Iraq for invading small oil-rich Kuwait. The measure forbids loan to Iraq or Kuwait and prohibits any activity, including the transfer of money, that would help the two country export their good. Sanctions adopted by the European Economic Community on Saturday froze Iraqi asset and suspended the purchase of oil from the two Arab country. More than 90 percent of import from Iraq to the 12-nation EEC are petroleum product. The EEC also suspended arm sale to Iraq. Switzerland, which is not a member of the United Nations, made the unusual move Tuesday of joining the UN. sanction and banned all trade with Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. In addition, Switzerland prohibited all payment and other financial transfer to Iraq and Kuwait. Denmark, Norway and Sweden also announced embargo on all trade with both country. Japan's participation in the UN. sanction wa seen a especially key since Tokyo usually ha taken a low profile in the Middle East, which supply much of it petroleum need. Japan import 99 percent of it oil. China joined the UN. decision to embargo arm sale to Iraq, but ha been le vocal than other major country in condemning the invasion. China sold arm to both Iran and Iraq during their eight-year war and is a major Iraqi trade partner. Cyprus' sacrifice in joining the embargo wa to give up 70 percent of it oil import, government spokesman Akis Fantis said. Cyprus ha sufficient oil supply to last until the end of August, he said, but we are already in the process of taking step to secure alternative source . The worldwide closing of rank against Iraqi oil import is likely to lead to even higher petroleum price, which have already risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact on the world economy. Wholesale oil price soared to five-year high in New York on Monday. France will introduce control Thursday on price of petroleum product to prevent refiner from using Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a an excuse to raise price, acting Premier Pierre Beregovoy announced Tuesday. An official with the Petroleum Association of Japan said he wa unaware of any increase yet in the price of gasoline for consumer. The official, who refused to be further identified, said it would be at least three month before the sanction could be expected to force higher gas price in Japan. An Iraqi airway jet carrying 78 foreigner and a number of Iraqi citizen arrived today, the first commercial flight allowed out of Iraq since it invaded Kuwait, a Japanese Embassy spokesman said.

The provisional government of free Kuwait set up by Iraq had threatened Sunday to hold hostage citizen of country imposing sanction on it. A US. diplomat said Washington had instructed American citizen living in or visiting Iraq and Kuwait to leave when circumstance permit. Here are some quote on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait: Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over oil production and their common border. July 17 Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving price down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue. He further charge that Arab state in the Persian Gulf are conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's economy and undermine it military buildup. July 18 Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil from well along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking to wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down price. July 20 Kuwaiti official suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting it creditor including Kuwait to write off billion of dollar in debt from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. July 24 The US. Defense Department announces that US. Navy warship and aircraft are holding a short-notice exercise in the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 mile southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait reinstates a state of alert it declared July 16 and canceled after three day of tension between the two oil-producing country. July 25 The Iraqi government in Baghdad say that it will not be intimidated by US. pressure in it oil dispute with neighboring Kuwait, and Saddams summons the US. ambassador for talk. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt say Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet in Saudi Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute. July 26 OPEC minister in Geneva agree to halt overproduction in hope of pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates pledge to abide by the agreement. Analysts say Saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the meeting. July 31 Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegation meet in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to negotiate the oil and border dispute. Diplomats say Iraq ha massed 100,000 troop on Kuwait's border, more than triple the number originally estimated. That number dwarf the Kuwaiti army, which ha a total of about 20,000 troop. Aug. 1 Iraq pull out of talk on the 2-week-old border, oil and money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends it force to invade the oil-rich sheikdom. Aug. 2 Iraq's powerful army overrun Kuwait before dawn with tank-led troop quickly seized the ruler's palace and other government building. THE INVASION: Iraq's troop, led by about 350 tank, crossed the border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and government building 40 mile away. Early Friday, the invader controlled Kuwait city, the capital. The soldier were also making sweep through the southern oilfield, according to resident and Lloyds' insurance service in London. Diplomatic source estimate more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion. Kuwait's Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia. THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, ha the Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldier on the Kuwaiti border. Kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, ha 1.9 million resident 60 percent foreigner and an army of 20,300 soldier. CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing oil from it territory and forcing down oil price through overproduction. Kuwait and UN. diplomat dismissed Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary. REACTION: The UN. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion. President Bush denounced it a naked agression. He froze Iraq's asset in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi import, including oil. The order also froze Kuwait property under US. jurisdiction a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it. The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arm sale to Iraq. Kuwait's US. ambassador said the nation had asked for American military intervention. A Pentagon source said a US. naval group wa diverted toward the Persian Gulf. Oil price soared in frenzied trading amid fear the invasion would reduce the supply of oil. Iranian editorial writer are rejoicing now that the world is waking up to one of their most hated bogeymen: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. A Monday headline: We warned you Frankenstein would torment his own creator. Saddam attacked Iran in September 1980 after a series of border skirmish, spawning a war that dragged until an August 1988 cease-fire. The conflict ha still not formally ended. Iran's late fundamentalist patriarch, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, vowed for year to unseat Saddam. Never at a loss for a vivid phrase, he compared accepting the cease-fire with Saddam to drinking poison. The status of Great Satan wa reserved for the United States, the all-encompassing public enemy No. 1 for the Islamic Republic. Iran frequently accuses both the US. and Saddam of trying to undermine the Islamic revolution. Saddam conveniently boast of having alone staunched the tide of radical Islam. In fact one of his reason for invading Kuwait on Thursday, the Iraqi press noted, wa it gall in demanding back ten of billion of dollar loaned to Iraq during the war Saddam say he fought for all Arabs. Over the past six month, successful U.N.-sponsored effort toward face-to-face negotiation between Iraq and Iran robbed Iranian newspaper and television commentator of a favorite target. Saddam's overthrow of the emir of Kuwait changed all that. Old score came brimming to the surface. Kuwait, after all, reflagged tanker in the United States during the Iran-Iraq war, ushering in the reason for the arrival of the US. Navy in the Persian Gulf in force. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency printed excerpt Mondya of an editorial from the Ettela'at newspaper that wa headlined: Foster child turn rapaciously on nourisher Kuwait. It noted that Kuwait had blindly supported Iraq, little knowing that it wa feeding a wild beast in her own neighborhood. Saddam ha also been called generalissimo and The Invader. Under the Frankenstein headline, IRNA said in it own commentary: For the time being, tiny Kuwait . breathes no more. With it sheikh a stateless person, and it powerful dinar which bankrolled the Iraqi military mere garbage, Kuwait is a nonentity, swallowed up by the dangerous pet it reared. Despite all the attention to the dangerous pet, the Great Satan ha not been forgotton. According to Iran's pundit, the Great Satan planned it all. It wanted to get the Navy back in the Persian Gulf.

Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victim because it treasury ha been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition. They have been very late in assisting the people, he said. Sympathy for the earthquake victim wa a secondary issue for the chanting, flag-waving rally participant, who also carried sign criticizing their native country. Planning for the event began three week before the earthquake, but part of the Friday's activity focused on Iran's stricken resident. Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live wa the cause for the widespread loss of life. This regime ha brought them nothing but devastation and misery. This regime ha devoted all of it resource to a senseless war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home, he said. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire wa declared last year after eight year of the Iran-Iraq war. Iran's Islamic republic wa established in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi wa deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and militant seized the US. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage. The United States broke diplomatic relation with Iran in April 1980. The shah died in exile in July 1980, US. hostage were freed six month later and Khomeini died last June. Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah but had no part in organizing the Islamic republic. Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in Iran, Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated 3,000 people attending the rally. There were many, many victim before this tragedy and there are victim now whose need need to be addressed by the people of the United States, he said. Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through non-government group. The State Department said Friday that Iran wa willing to accept earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and other US. humanitarian organization. An anti-American newspaper in Iran said Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of ten of thousand of people in last week's earthquake. The criminal role of America in Iran's past became evident once again in the recent earthquake, the Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Our people, even under the rubble, chant `Death to America' and pray to God to cut off the hand of the United States . even those hand stretched out to help, it said. It argued that by plundering Iran's oil and other resource for 25 year, the United States had prevented the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development project and advanced (anti-seismic) building construction system. Even after it expulsion from Iran, the US. government by imposing economic sanction and launching several other plot, halted the renovation of the country, the editorial added. The newspaper wa implying that with these action the United States had blocked the diversion of fund to earthquake safety measure. If the United States ha real humanitarian objective and intended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing, stop hatching plot, the newspaper said. It called on Iranians to reject relief offer by the United States and other government whose hand are stained with the blood of the Iranian people. Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostage at the US. Embassy in Tehran, ha said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other US. humanitarian group. The two nation have no diplomatic tie. Countries worldwide, both friendly and hostile to Tehran's Islamic government, sent supply, medical personnel and condolence to Iran, where about 40,000 people have died in an earthquake. Iran's deadliest earthquake since 1976 jolted the northern part of the country Thursday, devastating town and injuring at least 100,000 people. The United States sent a message of condolence and expressed it willingness to provide humanitarian aid. Iran, which ha had no diplomatic tie with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostage at the US. Embassy in Tehran, said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other US. humanitarian group. Moderate Arab country with which Iran ha had prickly relation Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan also offered their support. An official statement distributed late Friday by the Saudi Press Agency said the kingdom followed with deep sorrow the news of the tragedy. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia . declares it readiness to help in extending assistance to those harmed by the tragedy, wishing to help ease the pain of the afflicted from among the son of the Iranian Moslem nation, it said. Jordan announced Saturday it wa sending medical aid to Iran, but detail were not immediately clear. King Hussein sent condolence to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday in what is believed to be the first direct contact between Jordanian and Iranian head of state in almost a decade. Jordan backed Iraq in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which ended with a cease-fire in August 1988, and at one point sent hundred of Jordanian volunteer to fight alongside Iraqi soldier. Egypt wa sending two military plane with supply, the Middle East News Agency reported. President Hosni Mubarak offered the aid in the framework of Egypt's concern to provide help for brother and friend, especially at time of natural disaster. The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that a professional lifesaving team from the Armenian capital of Yerevan flew Saturday to Iran. The team gained experience in the devastating 1988 earthquake in Armenia that killed 25,000 people. Thousands of resident in the predominantly Moslem Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, which border Iran, donated ton of flour, rice and tea, and contributed more than $500,000 to a special earthquake fund, Tass said. The Italian Red Cross sent a plane to Iran Saturday with relief supply, including tent, blanket and medicine. In Paris, the French government, which already ha sent a 200-member civil defense team including rescuer, medical personnel and search dog said Saturday it would send an entire mobile hospital unit if Iran wanted it. In West Germany, the Foreign Ministry said that it wa sending tent, blanket, hospital equipment and cooking equipment to Iran. Eight ton wa being shipped Saturday and the government ha chartered a jumbo jet to transport 100 ton of equipment Monday. At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II sent aid to earthquake victim and a message of condolence to Iranian leader. The Vatican said in a statement that the donation of an unspecified amount wa to provide for the most immediate need of the population hurt by this huge earthquake. John Paul also sent a telegram to the papal nuncio, or diplomatic representative, in Tehran saying the pope is praying fervently for the wounded and the family of the victim. The Indian government said it would donate medicine, blanket and other relief supply worth more than $500,000. China's Red Cross said it wa sending $106,000 worth of relief supply, state-run television said Saturday. The Polish government wa sending 5 ton of powdered milk, a ton of bed sheet, a ton of medicine and 3 ton of blanket and clothing, according to Polish medium report. Malaysia wa providing more than $90,000 in relief aid. Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar told reporter Saturday the money would be used to buy medicine, food, powdered milk, tent and other essential item. The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminder of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988. Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people. Most died in structure that collapsed when the quake hit. It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the US. Geological Survey. The Armenian quake wa measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7 according to the US. Geological Survey. In the Iranian quake, the casualty count wa pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight. Many of the victim lived in fragile home built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapse easily. In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatality on shoddily built building. Most casualty from earthquake are caused by something falling on top of you, said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo. The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the building are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shift in an earthquake and allows structure to collapse, Needham said. The 7.7-magnitude quake wa the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plate of the earth's crust meet, he said. Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and that there have been many smaller quake. Twelve earthquake greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 year, Needham said. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated area. The earthquake that devastated Iran early Thursday took ten of thousand of life because people were asleep in fragile home built on flood plain, an earthquake expert said. Most casualty from earthquake are caused by something falling on top of you, said Russ Needham, a geophysist with the US. Geological Survey that monitor ground motion around the world. The quake hit at 12:30 am. in Iran, when most of the people were in their home, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo. At least 25,000 people died and thousand were injured in the quake, which demolished score of village and buried thousand of people in the rubble of their home, Iranian official said. Needham said most structure in that area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapse easily. It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, he said of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people. A Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatality on shoddily built building. The Armenian quake wa measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 77. The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal Iran where most of the building are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shift in an earthquake and allows structure to collapse, he said. The 7.7-magnitude quake wa the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plate of the earth's crust meet, Needhams said. Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and that there have been many smaller quake. Twelve earthquake greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 year, Needhams said. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated area.

The Iranian President appealed for international aid from all countries except Israel and South Africa. Countries around the world, both friendly and hostile to Iran's Islamic government, responded quickly. The aid from the United States, including funds and supplies raised by Iranians in California , was channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This was a rare example of U.S.-Iranian cooperation after the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Countries as diverse as Egypt, China, India, Malaysia and the Soviet Union sent help. Even Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born author of ""Satanic Verses,"" condemned to death by the Iranian ayatollahs, contributed $8,600. All was not sweetness and light, however.

They smeared ""Down with the KGB!"" and a swastika on the front of the building in white paint. The ""coup people,"" a President Bush dubbed them, could not have miscalculated more profoundly. They thought the issue wa Mikhail Gorbachev, and apparently believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening everyone else, they could quickly take charge of the country.;But the people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue wa not Gorbachev himself, but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reform had created. For the first time in their thousand-year history, Russians asserted their independence from autocracy, and the autocrat fell.;There will be much to sort out in the month ahead. But almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the democratic revolution it tried to choke. That revolution will alter the country, creating a new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much more quickly than anyone anticipated.;Gorbachev's own standing also will be transformed by these event. It seems unlikely that he can escape the consequence of his own past miscalculation -- especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule. Gorbachev wa the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late 20th century, but this week he wa trumped by Boris Yeltsin, who will now rightly be seen a the man who saved him.;Yeltsin had two talent that Gorbachev lacked. One wa the ability to stay close to the Russian people a their world wa transformed by Gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's abysmal standing in the poll. Yeltsin's second talent wa his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the Soviet Communist Party, the world from which both he and Gorbachev emerged.;Gorbachev could never shuck his party apparatchik's skin. Instead of reaching out to new idea and new people a Yeltsin ha, he surrounded himself with traditional Communist Party official and worried about the impact of new scheme and idea. Gorbachev thought Vladimir Kryuchkov of the KGB, Boris Pugo of the Ministry of Interior, Dmitri Yazov of the Red Army and Gennady Yanayev of the Communist Party were necessary bedfellow whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative force that hated his reform. Instead, they turned out to be mortal enemies.;If they had been only personal enemy, Gorbachev might have been undone by them. But when they closed the new, liberal news medium and reverted to the Stalinist tradition of the big lie, the member of the State Emergency Committee threatened not just Gorbachev but also the new Soviet Union -- a society that offered it citizen an unprecedented opportunity for dignity, self-reliance and freedom. For year, Soviets and Western Kremlinologists had debated whether the change that created this new Soviet Union were irreversible. Tuesday, it became clear that they were.;Of course, Gorbachev initiated those change, and history will credit him for that. He also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend.;It is intriguing in assessing the coup's failure that men trained a thug by some of the most violent and mean-spirited institution created by any state could not, in their moment of truth, behave like thug and kill their compatriot. They left Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin at large; they let the Western medium report their coup a it unfolded; and they allowed foreign radio station to broadcast news of it back into the country. Even their own news medium, under strict control, conveyed the fact that there wa widespread resistance to their attempted coup.;By Tuesday night, the Emergency Committee wa in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and this proved an unequal contest. As Gorbachev had previously discovered in his negotiation with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the legitimacy provided by the 50 million vote that Yeltsin received in the election for president of the Russian federation wa a formidable political force.;At first blush, the botching of the coup wa surprising -- couldn't the vaunted KGB and it ally run an efficient putsch? But these were representative of the political class that turned one of the world's richest nation into a basket case. Perhaps their coup should be seen a a desperate and forlorn effort to deny a truth that proved undeniable -- that the Stalinist system had failed so utterly there wa simply no way to redeem it. Gorbachev chose to ignore warning about the right's impending attempt to seize power. Some warning came from Gorbachev's liberal adviser, such a Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup. But, incredibly, the clearest signal came from the hard-liners themselves.;A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known a the ""nightingale of the General Staff,"" published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov. With remarkable candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover a an appropriate step to avert reform that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union. Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of Eight.;Gorbachev ignored these warnings.;To some -- an admitted minority -- the thought of a Gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of the traditional Soviet art of deception known a maskirovka. And to layman, something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power.;The most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from Gorbachev himself, in his Thursday news conference in which he described his three day under house arrest in the Crimea.;Among the questions: If Gorbachev's 32 armed guard remained loyal to him throughout, why wa there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup? Why didn't the coup leader incapacitate Gorbachev's guard, or at least separate them from him?;If Gorbachev's contact with the outside world wa limited to intercepting Western radio outlet on an ancient shortwave radio, how wa he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborator, down to his view of their trembling hands?;It is highly unlikely that the hard-liners had been set up or ordered by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing. Such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.;A more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev wa initially a full member of the conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new Union Treaty, to have been signed last Tuesday, which provided for transfer of key lever of power from the federal presidency to the leader of republics.;It is possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence.;Gorbachev did reveal, however, that two important official had visited him in Crimea at the outset of the coup. One wa head of the KGB department responsible for the security of Soviet leaders; the other wa V. Boldin, Gorbachev's closest aide, by the president's own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him. One can't help but wonder whether these two visitor came to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important document from fellow junta member at the outset of their joint enterprise.;Conspiracy theorist grope for motif -- Gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal element in his government, to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessened his power. But there is virtually unanimous agreement on one point. Gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal muttering about him. Cut to a row of dour Communists in ill-fitting gray suit announcing Gorbachev's illness and a palace coup. The camera zoom in on the impassive face of the two men last seen in Gorbachev's office.;What is going on here?;OK, it's a hackneyed device that would only work in the movie. But then, this week's event in the Soviet Union have all the making of a spy thriller.;Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theory are working overtime, though they insist that their darkest imaginings be clearly labeled ""pure speculation."";""Once you have a palace coup, the possibility are endless,"" said Robert Conquest, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution. ""Russian politics are full of very strange things."";For all we know, Conquest joked, Gorbachev could be injected with drug to change his personality or KGB scientist could produce a body-double to impersonate him.;""His friend would know, but would you or I?"" Conquest said. ""That would be going a bit far."";A more intriguing scenario ha Gorbachev conspiring with the coup plotter to engineer a transformation of the Soviet political landscape. The thinking go like this:;With his popularity at rock bottom, Gorbachev, a lifelong creature of the KGB, hatch a false coup in order to step out of the way while hard-liners and liberal battle each other. The coup fall apart and Gorbachev triumphantly return with a level of legitimacy he never enjoyed before.;The theory could explain the apparent bungling of the coup plotter, said author Joseph Finder, whose 1991 novel, ""The Moscow Club,"" foreshadowed many of the element of the current crisis.;Finder, who said he did not subscribe to the scenario, nonetheless pointed out that tank did not begin to roll until hour after Gorbachev's supposed arrest. Russian President Boris Yeltsin wa not arrested, and Leningrad wa left alone.;Speculation wa not unique to Kremlin watcher in the United States.;Theorizing wa rampant in the street of Moscow on Tuesday, said San Francisco businesswoman Kimberly Getto, who sent a long fax detailing speculation, fueled by the fact that many of the tank encircling the Russian parliament building had no ammunition. Gorbachev did not want bloodshed, according to the theory.;The Democratic Reform Movement, headed by former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's longtime ally, floated the same possibility in a statement Monday.;""It's highly implausible, but not to be excluded, that Gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal, thinking he'd show them they still needed him,"" said Norman Naimark, director of Stanford's Center for Russian and East European Studies. ""The degree of connivance is difficult to gauge."" At the news conference -- Gorbachev's first since the coup against him collapsed on Wednesday -- the 60-year-old leader condemned the takeover a being against ""the people, against democracy."";Earlier, he told reporter he would have killed himself rather than submit to any forced arrangement with the coup leader. ""I said I wouldn't make any deals,"" he said then. ""Otherwise, I would have had to commit suicide."";Gorbachev detailed his purge of coup leader, including Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov. He named a new acting KGB chief, interior minister and defense minister, and said he would do everything to ""drive out the reactionary force from the Communist Party."";Gorbachev pledged cooperation with Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin but said he had no plan to leave the Communist Party.;""I am convinced that socialism is correct. I am an adherent of socialism."";When asked if Yeltsin now had more power than he did, Gorbachev said, ""We have been bound together by the situation."";Looking and sounding angry, he described the plotter a ""primitive and crude and crafty"" and scoffed at their announcement that he had stepped aside because he wa ill. ""Their hand were shaking the whole time,"" he said derisively.;Despite his display of anger, the Soviet president said the failure of the coup could ultimately help ensure the continuation of his reform. ""We have to see this a an enormous opportunity,"" he said.;At his news conference, Gorbachev made a point of publicly praising Yeltsin, whose folk-hero stature wa enhanced during the coup a he rallied hundred of thousand of his supporter to resist.;Before dawn today, Gorbachev flew back to Moscow from the Crimea, where he had been confined to his summer home during his brief ouster.;The Soviet president, who wa reported to have slept for a few hour in his dacha outside Moscow after returning from the Crimea, arrived at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport unannounced, under heavy security. He looked somewhat disheveled, clad in a windbreaker and a shirt with open collar.;Appearing on Soviet television after his arrival, Gorbachev looked haggard and unshaven, with deep line around his eye and mouth. Later, at his news conference, he at first spoke haltingly, but then appeared to recover his composure and spoke in a forceful voice.;Gorbachev said his captor cut off all communication and that his only source of news during the coup had been from foreign broadcast, including the BBC and Voice of America, received on a makeshift radio set up by his personal guards.;""This ha been a very difficult, an extremely difficult lesson for me. It's my, you might say, my drama,"" he told reporters.;""Everything wa done to weaken me psychologically,"" Gorbachev said. ""It wa hard. It is hard to say it now, but that's how it was."";He said that early on in the coup, he tried to find out who wa behind it.;""I picked up one of the telephone I have and it wasn't working. I picked up a second, a third, a fourth . . . everything wa cut off,"" he said.;""Every day, morning and night, I demanded . . . that my communication be restored and that an airplane be brought immediately so I could be returned to Moscow,"" he said. He wa being held at his vacation home in the Crimea.;Gorbachev said the coup leader demanded that he resign.;""I said, 'You will never live that long (to see me resign).' "";He called the crisis ""one of the most difficult trial of the entire history"" of his six-year rule.;Gorbachev said his 32-man personal guard stayed with him throughout the coup.;The 60-year-old president said the crisis had been difficult for his family, especially his wife, Raisa, who ""took it very hard."";""Best of all, my granddaughter Anastasia didn't understand anything that wa going on,"" Gorbachev told reporter. ""She wanted to go to the beach; that's all that concerned her. But the guard wouldn't let her go to the beach; they were concerned something would happen."";When it became clear the coup wa failing, Gorbachev said he prepared himself and his family for the possibility that they would be killed by the conspirators.;""You know that it appeared a though they might have done something to me. They might have killed me and my whole family and made it look a if . . . they were acting in the name"" of the acting president.;""These people might have done almost anything,"" he said. Gorbachev told an audience at the Russian parliament that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover. ""They wanted to turn u into meat. They wanted to annihilate u, and for that they must bear the severe responsibility,"" the Soviet president said.;He accused the Communist Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup.

14,d106g,"The arrival Wednesday of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela prompted an outpouring of praise and encouragement from politician and supporter. A sampling of their comments: In the 15 month since he walked free from prison, Nelson Mandela ha played the chief role in talk with President FW. de Klerk and the white government. He ha presided over an African National Congress divided and not yet organized for politics. He ha spent his moral capital trying, unsuccessfully, to end the murderous conflict between black political factions.; Now Mandela is confronted with his wife's conviction for a brutal criminal offense. He ha loyally defended her innocence. He ha seemed to hear no voice to the contrary. But event have caught up.; The radical in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs. Mandela to arouse member against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.; There are rumor that at a national conference next month the radical will try to move such older leader a Mandela and Walter Sisulu aside to a nominal senior role.; It is a gloomy picture: an elderly man bearing the hope of peace in South Africa beset by problem, personal trauma on top of political. But I think it would be wrong to conclude that the South African drama is necessarily heading toward a tragic end.; One reason for a degree of optimism is the way South Africans on all side, most of them, have dealt with Winnie Mandela's trial: calmly and fairly.; During the year of white supremacy the law ha been viciously misused. But from all one can tell, this trial wa handled professionally by the judge, Justice Michael Stegmann.; The reaction to the verdict and six-year prison sentence wa also mild. Surprisingly few supporter gathered outside the court to cheer Mrs. Mandela. The ANC issued a detached statement saying that the last word had not been spoken in the case. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said ""the movement is larger than any individual.""; A more fundamental reason for hope is that FW. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial South Africa. They need each other. Without their agreement, there can be no solution, no outcome that leaf a viable country.; The next step is formal negotiation. They can come only when the government take further step to meet the reasonable ANC demand for action against violence -- in particular, a ban on the carrying of so-called ""cultural"" weapon such a spear. How can the government look away when 1,000 Zulus carrying spear and machete slaughter township residents?; The time factor is crucial now. Negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of the public, black and white, is to retain hope for a peaceful solution. World and time press on Nelson Mandela. A 3-year campaign that ha succeeded in getting Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela ha raised objection from some faculty and student. Northeastern announced plan to award the degree honoring Mandela on May 13, ending a long effort by student seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degree for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony. The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner. Law student last September began a campaign of demonstration and vigil on the campus. They hung a banner from the second floor of the law library that said: Honor Nelson Mandela. Before he wa imprisoned, said third-year law student Sarah Ottinger, Nelson Mandela wa an . attorney and an activist who worked against apartheid. That's the message we wanted conveyed to student. South Africa's white-minority government say it will free Mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by force seeking political power for black in the country. Some faculty member and student, including many black, have criticized the administration's plan for the event, saying no effort wa made to include them. I don't even know what office is sponsoring it, said Keith Motley, dean and director of the African-American Institute, a student group. We got a memo from the administration saying they need six usher, but that's it. You'd think at least we'd be clued in to what's going on. This started out a something noble, something we've tried to have done for three year, said Ottinger. We are very, very sorry it happened this way. It wasn't meant to turn out like this. The trustee decided in January that Mandela should get the honorary degree. Students set up a committee to contact Mandela's family to get their approval. University spokesman Paul Jones said letter were sent to Mandela's wife, Winnie, and his two daughters: Zenani, a student at Boston University, and Makaziwe, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. However, Northeastern still ha not received approval from the Mandela family, The Boston Globe reported. Unidentified assailant hurled a grenade and fired shot today at the home of relative of Nelson Mandela, killing a baby girl and injuring her parent, police said. African National Congress official said the dead child and her parent were distant cousin of Nelson Mandela. They denied South African police and press report that the child wa Mandela's great-granddaughter. Police said they did not know who wa responsible for the attack. No group took immediate responsibility. Police Lt. Govindesamy Mariemuthoo said the attack occurred before dawn at the home of Monde Mandela in the black township of Soweto. The blast badly damaged part of the house, knocking hole in the wall and causing extensive damage. The police officer said a baby girl wa killed and her parent injured. He gave no other detail on the victim. He said the room in which the injured couple had been sleeping wa destroyed. ANC official said the dead child wa the great niece of Mandela's father, making her a distant cousin of Nelson Mandela. The dead girl's father, Monde Mandela, run a small grocery shop. The ANC official said Nelson Mandela wa close to the Monde Mandela family. An ANC statement said, The ANC note the curious coincidence of an attack on a man bearing the Mandela name at this time. Given the distant connection between Mandela and the family, police said they did not know if the attack wa deliberate or just a random attack linked to the general violence. Mandela wa reportedly attending a political meeting in the eastern province of Natal today. Soweto and other black township around Johannesburg have been hit by black factional fighting that ha killed about 800 people since August. The fighting ha pitted follower of the ANC against Zulus of the conservative Inkatha group. Mandela ha repeatedly accused security force of manipulating the violence to derail government effort to end apartheid and share power with the black majority. The police have denied Mandela's charge. Mandela wa released in February after 27 year in jail for opposing the white minority government. He is closely guarded by ANC operative, and there have been report of threat on his life in recent month. Mandela and other ANC leader have been negotiating with President FW. de Klerk to pave the way for full-scale talk on ending apartheid, the South African system of racial separation. De Klerk ha promised to end white-minority rule. Mayor David Dinkins warned Jewish group against protesting the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New York City, saying the protest might insult the black community, a newspaper said today. The mayor also asked member of the organized Jewish community to dissuade more radical group from disrupting the visit, the Daily News said. Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, will visit eight city from June 20 to July 1. There is a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in very, very high esteem taking great umbrage at any public protest, Dinkins said. I think it's sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very unwise, because this man is an international symbol of freedom and especially so seen by person of color, Dinkins told the newspaper in an interview. Leaders of several Jewish-American organization plan to meet Mandela on Sunday in Geneva. The organization want the South African leader to clarify his position on Israel. Mandela ha embraced Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in public and ha compared the struggle of Palestinians to that of black South Africans. Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announced his Coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandela's public welcome in New York because of the anti-apartheid leader's unbending anti-Israel stance. City councilman Noach Dear and state assemblyman Dov Hikind said if Mandela doe not make a strong statement in support of Israel, they would take out ad in newspaper and hold demonstration. Four imprisoned African National Congress leader, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist said today. The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spent about six hour with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend of the Mandelas. Mandela wa moved to the suburban-style home on the prison ground Dec. 7 after recovering from tuberculosis at a private clinic in Cape Town. Mandela's wife, Winnie, said after visiting her husband last month that he is being held practically in solitary confinement at the house. The four men who visited Mandela are Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mhlangeni, Raymond Mhlaba and Ahmed Kathrada. The men were convicted along with Mandela and three others at the same trial in 1964. All were given life sentence for their activity with the ANC, the main guerrilla group attempting to overthrow the white-led government. All of them except Sisulu had not seen Nelson since 1986, and they were very excited at being able to spend time with him, Omar said. Of the three co-defendant not at the Dec. 23 gathering, two have been released and one remains at the Robben Island Prison near Cape Town. The Prisons Service declined to confirm or deny the visit. A representative of the African National Congress said Saturday the South African government may release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela a early a Tuesday. There are very strong rumor in South Africa today that on Nov. 15 Nelson Mandela will be released, said Yusef Saloojee, chief representative in Canada for the ANC, which is fighting to end white-minority rule in South Africa. Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jailed 27 year ago, wa sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the South African government. He wa transferred from prison to a hospital in August for treatment of tuberculosis. Since then, it ha been widely rumored Mandela will be released by Christmas in a move to win strong international support for the South African government. It will be a victory for the people of South Africa and indeed a victory for the whole of Africa, Saloojee told an audience at the University of Toronto. A South African government source last week indicated recent rumor of Mandela's impending release were orchestrated by member of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some action. And a prominent anti-apatheid activist in South Africa said there ha been no indication (Mandela) would be released today or in the near future. Apartheid is South Africa's policy of racial separation. The largest family group to visit black leader Nelson Mandela since he wa jailed 27 year ago gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his 71st birthday. His wife, Winnie Mandela, arrived Monday night and indicated she did not expect Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, would be freed soon. She said that opinion came from her husband, who she visited last week after Mandela's July 5 meeting with President PW. Botha. That meeting sparked speculation that Mandela would be freed this year. He is serving a life term after being convicted of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government. Mrs. Mandela, referring to her earlier visit with her husband, told reporters: He said from that meeting with PW. Botha we musn't construe a indicating his release. His release wasn't even there. In fact it wa not on the agenda at all. Mrs. Mandela, dressed in black a an expression of mourning, spoke with reporter at the DF. Malan Airport. She said the family normally spent Mandela's birthday at home, fasting and praying, but member would visit him this year on his birthday because he ha invited u to come and share it with him. The family said 14 relative, including child from both of Mandela's marriage, would go to Mandela's house at the Victor Verster prison farm in Paarl, north of Cape Town. In addition to Mrs. Mandela the group will include three of Mandela's child, one daughter-in-law, eight grandhildren and a great-grandson. Mrs. Mandela showed reporter a huge cardboard birthday card in the black, green and yellow color of the outlawed African National Congress, the largest guerrilla group fighting the government. She said the card wa made by member of the National Union of Mineworkers. It is very nice but it is also at the same time very sad, she said of the planned birthday celebration. After all, he is not at home. Mandela wa allowed to meet last Friday with five other ANC member convicted with him in 1964 of trying to overthrow the government and still imprisoned in Cape Town, according to Dullah Omar, a family friend and attorney. Mandela ha been in prison since 1962 when he wa sentenced to five year for leaving the country illegally and organizing an illegal strike. He wa given a life sentence following the 1964 conviction. Omar said Tuesday's family gathering will be an occasion with a strong theme of sadness because after the reunion they will leave Mr. Mandela to resume his lonely life. Mandela's oldest grandson, Mandla, 14, arrived Monday evening from Swaziland where he is a student at a private school. Mandla is the son of Makgatho Mandela, the prisoner's eldest son by his first marriage to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, who life in the black township of Soweto and wa not expected to join the reunion. Makgatho Mandela came to Cape Town with his wife, Zondi, his daughter Indaba and 4-year-old Thembela, Mandela's great-grandson. Thembela is the grandson of Tembikile Mandela. Tembikile, Mandela's son by his marriage to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, died in an automobile accident in 1970. Evelyn Ntoko Mase, the cousin of ANC leader Walter Sisulu who ha been imprisoned with Mandela, married Nelson Mandela in 1944. They had four child. One of their daughter, Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, arrived with her three child from the United States, where she is studying for a doctoral degree in anthropology at Amherst College in Massachusetts. She said, He (Nelson Mandela) belief that education is the key to all door and he would like to see all of his child get an education; in fact all of the black child . because you cannot claim to want to rule the country and be the leader of the future if you have people who are untrained and don't have any skill. Mrs. Mandela-Amuah said of her father's possible release, I always firmly believe that you can't predict what the South African government will do.

From prison he had led the fight against the government's policy of racial segregation, apartheid.  He, along with other members of the African National Congress, was convicted in 1964 of conspiracy to overthrow the government.  Over the years, international pressure had been mounting for his release and several governments had barred imports from South Africa or investments in the country.  Upon his release Mandela continued the fight for black human rights, but he faced many problems.  He attempted to negotiate an end to the violence between the ANC and the Zulu Inkatha group, which had resulted in many deaths in the Black townships.  His wife was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to 6 years in prison.  Nelson joined the ANC when he was 26 and rose to a leadership position. The ANC was outlawed in 1960.   He was sentenced to five years in prison in 1962 for illegally leaving the country and for organizing a strike.  Mandela was highly praised during a visit to the United States after his release, but Jewish groups were critical of his support for the Palestine Liberation Organization."
15,d105g,"Viktor Alksnis, former USSR Supreme Soviet deputy, today reminded u of his existence. [Correspondent Irina Zaytseva] Viktor Alksnis, born 1950, Latvian, former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the former USSR, soldier, resigned from the Army in order to fight for the restoration of the USSR. During the October event he left the White House with a head wound and wa taken to hospital. After a long interval Viktor Alksnis held a news conference today in the Slavjanskaya Hotel. He began it with a short statement, the essence of which come down to the fact that the adoption of the Latvian citizenship law violates not only human right, but creates the condition for a conflict similar, in his opinion, to the one in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. It wa not only the Latvian Government Alksnis accused of this, but also the United States. According to him, during the latest visit to the United States by [Latvian President] Guntis Ulmanis, sanction wa obtained for the adoption of the aforementioned discriminatory law. [Begin Alksnis recording] And thus carte blanche wa given for mild ethnic cleansing of the Russian speaking population of the republic. [end recording] [Zaytseva] Apart from that, Alksnis added, according to information received from reliable source, certain circle in Moscow want conflict in Latvia. [Begin Alksnis recording] A certain scenario exists to drive a so-called security corridor along the route Daugavpils-Yekabpils-Riga where stringent ethnic cleansing of the Latvian population will take place in reply to the mild ethnic cleansing of the Russian population in order to bring so-called independent Latvia to it knee. [end recording] [Zaytseva] Journalists asked for more precise information about what Alksnis called reliable source. [Begin Alksnis recording] You understand that I cannot name these source. But I can say that they are fairly authoritative. [end recording] [Zaytseva] Asked what he intends to do, Alksnis said his opportunity are unfortunately limited, and that is why he is appealing to journalist. In his opinion, only joint effort can bring this information to the attention of world public opinion, point out the seriousness of this issue, and avoid the coming tragedy. Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying nationalist passion benefit opponent of his reform. The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relation were worsening in some region of the country, due in part to active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt group. Perestroika, or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program for widespread economic and social change. State-run medium also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. The six-month conflict between the two republic over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh district ha led to mass rally, strike and ethnic violence since February. The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, intervened July 18. It rejected any change in Nagorno-Karabakh's status but called for measure to develop the region's economy and culture. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic dispute faced by Gorbachev since he became Communist Party chief in March 1985. He indicated Friday he want to defuse tension between ethnic group, but also to punish those who transform the tension into a political crisis. Gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the Central Committee, the party's policy-making body. A summary of his remark wa distributed by the official Tass news agency. Gorbachev outlined the reason for a current aggravation of tension between ethnic group in some region of the Soviet Union, Tass said. Among the cause, Gorbachev listed a lack of concern for many year for the specific requirement of people and ethnic group, inadequate control by the mass over the activity of executive personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt group. Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that nationalist passion benefit all anti-perestroika force, he suggested increasing accountability in Soviet law for kindling ethnic strife. Tass did not give detail of Gorbachev's suggestion. At the July 18 Presidium meeting, the Soviet leader accused corrupt conservative who oppose his reform of hiding behind the Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive. Gorbachev said the ground for tougher legislation come directly from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which say the law can punish any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt. Tass said Gorbachev made other proposal on how to resolve ethnic tension, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republic, a law on equal use of the more than 100 language spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republic and region. In particular, the Baltic republic of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, have demanded more say in their own economic and government affair. The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, will face criminal charge following an incident in which activist seeking the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh attached slogan to their car and drove around the city. The paper did not give the date or size of the mobile demonstration, but said 155 driver have had their license revoked and 310 were fined. In it July 18th decision, the Presidium also ordered local law enforcement agency to ensure order wa restored in the Caucasus Mountain region. Tass reported Friday that the situation wa stabilizing in Armenia, but said that at the urging of instigator, some strike and protest were continuing. The international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflict in the former Soviet Union. The problem is indeed a pressing one. The dispute in the Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union are causing great suffering for those involved. They are a source of legitimate concern to the Russians, who are worried by clash close to their border. They are concerned too about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those country where there are conflict, and about the economic and social consequence of refugee fleeing to Russia (whose potential number is estimated at more than 2m). They believe that the problem in some of the former Soviet republic are either ignored or misunderstood. The Russians fear that if they do nothing, the conflict will worsen and probably spread. They argue that they have a legitimate concern in trying to resolve conflict that threaten their security. They ask why, when the international community is engaged in peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the world's trouble spot, similar effort should not be undertaken in the hot spot near them. Equally, these dispute are of legitimate concern to Britain, it western partner and the whole international community, both for humanitarian reason and because such flashpoint risk provoking regional instability. If uncontrolled, they pose a variety of threat to European security, including increased traffic in drug and arm a well a international terrorism. Crises in Russia's newly independent neighbour may also complicate Russia's relation with the west: unless they are carefully handled, they risk prejudicing the emerging relationship between u. The west is sometimes suspicious of Moscow's attitude. There are no difference about the need to resolve these conflicts: but there are difference over how to go about it. The British government will not underwrite Russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troop will not turn into occupying force. Nor are country that secured their independence when the Soviet Union wa dissolved keen that the west should concede to Moscow the same role it played in the Soviet empire. They fear that this would compromise their sovereignty. When they are willing for Russian troop to play a peacekeeping role, they want there to be some form of international monitoring. This ha meant that, even though the west lack the resource to engage directly in those trouble spot, it ha been wary of appearing to endorse Russian involvement instead, in case it had imperial tendency. If we are to fashion a joint approach by Russia and it western partner to the problem of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, we must address all these concern. Clearly Russia ha an important role to play in this area. If the Russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community, the west in turn need guarantee that Russia will not regard recognition of it involvement a giving it carte blanche in the former Soviet Union. Peace-keeping in the former Soviet Union, a indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply with internationally recognised principle. It need to be looked at on a case by case basis. Respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent country must remain paramount. We agreed that the principle underlying Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operation would need to include: strict respect for the sovereignty of the country involved; an invitation from the government concerned and the consent of the party to the conflict; commitment to a parallel political peace process; a clear mandate setting out the role of the peacekeeping force (which should whenever possible be multinational in character); and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping force deployed. These principle should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the party to the conflict, focus attention and, where possible, resource on the settlement of conflict in the former Soviet Union. All this will help enhance Russian peacekeeping practice. Although the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the UN lack the resource to put large number of peacekeeper on the ground themselves, they may be able to suggest measure to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process. Extending co-operation within the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and also co-operation between Russia and Nato, might help improve training for Russian peacekeeper. This is an area we shall need to explore further. We also need to put much more emphasis on preventive diplomacy. One of the way in which we can help prevent conflict is to strengthen the democratic institution in the newly independent country of the former Soviet Union. The CSCE and other international institution can play an important role here, drawing the newly independent country into a more active dialogue on way of promoting democratic value and principle. We discussed way of strengthening the CSCE's role, including the role of the High Commissioner for National Minorities, at the recent Rome ministerial meeting. We must try to find way of managing and resolving tension before they erupt into conflict. It will not be easy, but we must try. Potentially explosive cocktail of ethnic and political animosity could spread the fire of intolerance all too easily to other country and region. We need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership. And we need to deal with it urgently. Our security is indivisible and we must ensure it by vigorous and imaginative effort aimed at promoting peace for all a well a right for all. The author are UK foreign secretary and Russian foreign minister RUSSIA flew 3,000 special force to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled Caucasus mountain at the weekend, it second troop deployment in a week to support a beleaguered government in it former empire. Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Spetsnaz commando and elite police to Vladikavkaz, capital of the Russian autonomous republic of North Ossetia, 1,100 mile south of Moscow. The troop were sent to halt fighting between Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who official claimed were setting fire to Ossetian-owned home. Scores were reported killed and injured in street fighting between Ossetians and Ingush in the past several day. Ingush rebel were reported yesterday to have taken hostage 80 Russian interior ministry soldier based in the region. A local official said the soldier were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said. The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the return of land that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and declared part of North Ossetia. Mr Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar held emergency meeting on the crisis on Saturday and yesterday. At the same time, the North Ossetian government said it would distribute Russian army-supplied automatic weapon to civilian volunteer. 'The Russian authority are strong enough to make all those violating the law respect it,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's specialist on the Caucasus, told Russian television. The Russian action mirrored recent development in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troop have also been deployed. The Central Asian nation, which ha yet to form it own army since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, ha also distributed weapon to civilian. On October 26-27 Russian soldier played a crucial role in crushing a coup attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. The Caucasus mountain, which stretch from southern Russia to the border of Turkey and Iran, are engulfed by several conflict. Among them are Georgia's war with Abkhazian separatist, and Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflict, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider it law making Moldavian the republic's official language. The republic's parliament acted in response to a decree issued on Dec. 22 by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the official news agency Tass reported. Gorbachev also gave the republic 10 day to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measure guaranteeing equal right for all ethnic group within it border. Tass said the Moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that Gorbachev said restricted the right of minority. Ethnic tension ha gripped Moldavia, a largely agricultural republic bordering Romania, during it push for independence from the Soviet Union this year. The unrest turned violent last month, when government troop clashed with activist, leaving four dead. Gorbachev said the conflict had reached critical level, and he put part of the blame on the Moldavian Supreme Soviet for enacting law that discriminate against minority. Alarmed by rising Moldavian nationalism, two of the republic's minority group have begun their own separatist movement. The Gagauz, a group of about 150,000 Turkish Christians, declared a new republic in southern Moldavia. In the eastern part of Moldavia, more than 300,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have joined in declaring a new republic along the Dneister River. All three group claim discrimination by Moldavians. In particular, they resent a new law making Moldavian the official language and requiring people in dozen of job ranging from doctor to hairdresser to pas Moldavian language test by 1995. Tass did not say how the Moldavian parliament would modify the law. Moldavian is identical to Romanian except for the Cyrillic script Josef Stalin imposed on the republic. It is spoken by two-thirds of the republic's resident. Soviet hard-liners want Gorbachev to impose a state of emergency and presidential rule in troubled zone throughout the ethnically and geographically diverse country. Gorbachev said the declaration of the Gagauz and Dniester republic wa illegal under the Soviet and Moldavian constitution, a were election to form legislature and any action by those body. The Moldavian legislature ha also voted to declare the election null and void. After resident of the Gagauz region began holding local election in late October, the Moldavian legislature clamped a two-month state of emergency on the region, restricting movement in and out of the area and banning public rally. Volunteer brigade of college-age Moldavians, who then flocked to the region to try to stop the separatist movement, were ordered dissolved by Gorbachev's decree. The volunteer were organized by nationalist group, including the Moldavian People's Front. A CEASEFIRE in Moldova wa threatened yesterday when a truck driver transporting militiaman wa shot dead by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority. The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the Moldovan authority, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr. At least nine people have been killed in clash over the past week. As in the more severe conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the underlying tension are growing and neither side belief it is losing. In other respect, however, the conflict are quite different and illustrate the complexity of conflict with which the former Soviet Union is now faced. The Trans Dnestr conflict stem directly from the breakup of the Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh ha been a source of tension between Azeris and Armenians for century. Moldova (formerly Moldavia) wa finally taken under full Soviet control in 1944. The Soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempt to preserve it former link with Romania - calling Moldovan a separate language from Romanian, and constructing a separate history for the Moldovan people. Industry wa largely situated on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staffed by Russians and Ukrainians. Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 per cent of the population, with Moldovans accounting for 64 per cent. The little republic (4.5m people) wa slow to respond to the stirring of reform. When it did, in 1989, a language movement quickly put the hardline Communist Party on the defensive and it lost power in 1990 to the present nationalist government, headed by President Mircea Snegur, the former secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee. From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it wa clear that the Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minority would be hostile, reacting to law establishing Moldovan a the official language and to call for renewed union with Romania with strike and demonstration, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov. During the August coup last year, the Moldovan government stoutly rejected it and the Trans Dnestr authority welcomed it, siding with the Soviet army in it brief effort to impose military rule. Thereafter, the two side have gathered military force. The Trans Dnestr side ha been augmented by Cossacks from nearby area returning to their traditional role a defender of Russia's border. The daily Izvestia reported yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appointed themselves mercenary for the Russians (they are paid from Rbs2,000 to Rbs5,000 a week by the Trans Dnestr authorities). TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clash between Azeri and Armenian militant. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States' defence minister, announced the decision a fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of effort to secure a truce. The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by Armenians. The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the death earlier this week of a handful of soldier caught in the fighting between Armenian guerrilla and Azerbaijani force. Fighting flared again yesterday in the capital Stepanakert, where the regiment is based. Azerbaijani and Armenian official claimed their civilian target were under particularly vicious attack. Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, ha long warned that he would withdraw troop rather than allow them to become target of ethnic conflict in the former Soviet Union. No date have been given for the withdrawal. Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn. Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which encompasses Georgia a well a Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered to rebuff attack on military installation. Azeri and Armenian official say sophisticated weapon, including combat helicopter, tank and armoured personnel carrier, are being used by guerrilla on both side in the four-year-old conflict. Armenian militant attacked the last Azeri stronghold in Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday, according to Azerbaijan's interior ministry, which said resident of the town of Shusha fled a helicopter gunships swooped down from snow-covered mountain. Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan will not give up any territory. Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official news agency Tass said Wednesday. Tass said 748 of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a search wa continuing for a police officer who vanished June 7. No new outbreak were reported in the region near the border city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clash arising from a land dispute began on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems. The argument involves allocation of land in a densly populated region where housing is scarce. It wa the latest in a series of bloody civil conflict to trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government. Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministry's Political Department, said that in two year of civil strife mainly ethnic clash in the Soviet Union, about 24,000 people have been arrested. He said in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troop had to be used in 13 region of the Soviet Union because of such outbreak, Tass said. Grienko said 16 ministry soldier were killed, four were reported missing and more than 1,000 wounded. Tass did not quote Grienko on how civilian casualty. The general wa quoted a saying these conflict were often accompanied by riot and pogrom, arson and massacre of innocent people, (and) complete or partial destabilization of the situation. Besides unrest this month in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence also ha been reported in recent year in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan. The government ha decided to give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homeland by Josef Stalin their own autonomous region but it will take year, Tass reported Wednesday. The ice ha been broken. A start ha been made. We're working on creating such autonomy, said Rafik Nishanov, chairman of a chamber of the Soviet legislature, in remark carried by the official news agency. However, he said, the nut and bolt of how to create the region still had to be worked out. For example, a 10-year program on resettlement. People can't just be expelled from the area for others to move in. The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked people out of their homeland on the ground they could not be trusted to occupy strategic area. The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional land, and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all people exiled under Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated. But other people now occupy the land and house that belonged to the exile, and re-establishing their dominion in their home region will not be so simple. The Supreme Soviet took the basic decision that the two autonmous region should be created on Nov. 28 but kept it quiet, apparently fearing explosive reaction from the population now living in the region. It wa also a potentially dangerous precedent: The Soviet Union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic group, and many of them have outstanding territorial claim. Trouble already ha been reported between ethnic Germans and Russians in several city on the Volga. Residents of the Saratov and Volgograd region have protested the prospect of seeing many of the nation's estimated 2 million Germans descending on them. Ethnographers estimate there are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars in the Soviet Union, and another 1 million in Turkey. Their protest near the Kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return to their homeland were among the first test of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promise of greater democracy. Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back to the Crimea each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return. A wave of some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrated to West Germany this year, but many would probably stay if they could be assured of their own republic, said Irina Ostroukh, a researcher at the Soviet Institute of Ethnography who study ethnic Germans. The Nov. 28 plan approved by the Supreme Soviet recommended excluding from the German region area where resistance to German resettlement wa strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflict. The explosive conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the Nagorno-Karabakh region ha led to 200 death and hundred of thousand of refugee in the last two year. Both side claim control over the mountainous enclave. The Supreme Soviet charged the government with creating a commmission to determine how to create the region for the Germans and Crimean Tatars. RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troop to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter report from Moscow. Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundred of heavily armed Russian troop from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia. Georgian national guard occupied similar position on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilian and injured two others, underscoring the difficulty facing the operation. The mission wa the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year ha prompted wave of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoint from the Romanian to the Afghan border. Reports from the former Soviet republic of Moldova said several people had been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violation between government force and separatist. In the Transcaucasian republic of Armenia, Radio Russia said five civilian had died overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the latest victim of a four-year undeclared war which ha killed 2,000 people. Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of 'political measure and actions'. South Ossetia is part of Georgia but want to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia, which wa assigned to Russia by Stalin. Hundreds have been killed since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians. The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet band and matching chevron on their sleeve. They will be joined later by a multi-ethnic force - Russians, Ukrainians, Ossetians and other mountain people - under the nominal command of North Ossetian leader. The peace-keepers' mission is to form a physical barrier between the two side, opening the way to future talk. The greatest threat is expected to come from hundred of armed fighter on both side, operating independently in a dozen or so band outside the control of either Russian or Georgian authority. Interfax news agency said Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, at present on a visit to Moldova, proposed a similar peace-keeping operation there.

There had been unrest in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, and serious fighting in Georgia, Azerbaijan and KazakhstanThe demise of the Soviet Union touched off new ethnic conflicts.

16,d104g,"The Chinese government say that 300 soldier, thug, bystander and student have been killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing. But most other estimate of casualty are far higher. State Council spokesman Yuan Mu said on Tuesday that 7,000 people, including 5,000 soldier, have been injured and 400 other soldier are missing and may be dead or wounded. Non-official source say Yuan's figure on civilian casualty are far too low, but most have different estimate on the number of victim. They range from 500 to 12,000 people slain. In Washington, US. intelligence report indicate 3,000 people probably were killed, according to a US. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said estimate of the number of dead could go higher. Nearly all of the death and injury occurred Saturday night and early Sunday when troop, firing randomly into large crowd, smashed through barricade to reach Tiananmen square and attack demonstrator demanding democratic reform. One doctor said Sunday that a quick check of 10 hospital placed the death toll at 500. Other source, compiling various report and survey, estimated more than 1,000 people had been killed. That number ha increased with additional detail and rumor of killing. Some official of China's Red Cross said 2,600 people were killed but Beijing's Red Cross office ha refused to provide any figure. One Hong Kong newspaper reported 5,000 death and 30,000 injured. An Eastern European diplomat, whose country ha good relation with China, insisted that 12,000 people were slain by soldier a they attacked protester in Tiananmen Square. That figure is certainly high. Probably fewer than 10,000 people were in the square when the troop moved in and most were able to escape unharmed. But student who had joined the Tiananmen occupation said hundred of colleague from the Academy of Fine Arts who were huddled around their Goddess of Democracy statue in the square were shot or crushed by tank. Beijing University student said 150 of their fellow student who were in the square are missing. There were rumor that after the square wa cleared troop burned many corps in large bonfire and other body were removed by helicopter and garbage truck to minimize the death count. Yuan's statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured were student. The exact number of people killed may never be known. Victims were taken to dozen of hospital, clinic and home, and there is no indication the government will reveal many detail of the tragedy. And the death toll mount.

Troops surround and enter the square June 4 in the early morning hour and thousand of protester flee. Hundreds are wounded and many dead. Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen Square with tank and rifle-toting troop ruling the vast expanse occupied the day before by student seeking a freer society from their communist ruler. A low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100-acre square a bonfire set during the night's confrontation continued to smolder. Hundreds of helmeted troop were deployed on the monument to revolutionary hero in the square's center and thousand more at important intersection nearby. Tanks moved into place on what had hour earlier been a rag-tag squatter's camp of tent for the pro-democracy student. The battle for Tiananmen wa primarily fought in the street leading to the square, where score of people fell trying to prevent column of troop and armored military vehicle from moving on the student. Gunfire could be heard from several side, and tracer zipped through the sky above Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum, one of the main monument to Chinese communism in the square. Torched bus and army vehicle on the street around Tiananmen billowed acrid smoke. Troops first entered the square from the south, when a column trotted toward the student encampment about 1 am. (noon EDT Saturday). They took up position to the east after a brief skirmish involving club and stick with student. More soldier were deployed in front of the Great Hall of the People to the west, and a huge convoy with armored vehicle rolled down Changan Avenue to the north side. The few thousand student remaining in the square stayed calm a they quietly gathered on the step of the heroes' monument. I'm not afraid, several said a the heavily armed troop encircled. Hundreds of supporter continued to mill around the square, many dressed more for a summer outing than a military battle. Loudspeakers blaring government and student announcement engaged in a noisy propaganda battle throughout the night. The government is corrupt, you've been tricked, the student roared. The state-run speaker warned that troop would use every mean at their disposal to clear the square and that remaining student would bear responsibility for the consequence. At 4 a.m., the lamposts that dot the square went ominously dark, and the student loudspeaker played the Internationale, the socialist anthem. A Taiwan singer staging a hunger strike for democracy took the microphone and proclaimed: We've achieved a big victory. . We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost too much blood. After the light went back on a half hour later, a voice vote by the student showed most wanted to leave the square to avoid further bloodshed. They quickly filed out under the banner of their school, carrying the quilt and padded jacket that offered warmth during the 22-day sit-in. Neither the student nor the Beijing resident who arrived to show support could control their tear. Go with u, they told their supporter, who applauded the student a they retreated. As they sobbed, many student defiantly shouted: We shall return! and flashed V-for-victory sign. Gone from Tiananmen Square are the pro-democracy banner and the tent of China's freedom movement, replaced by tank, armed guard and the chant of drilling soldier. The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the capital six day ago, leaving hundred dead and crushing a movement for political change. Troops moved back their barricade, making it possible for city resident to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven week stood at the heart of the movement. Buses and bicyclist today were allowed to pas by Changan Avenue, which border the north edge of the square. The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy, a 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, wa taken by a tread-wheeled armored personnel carrier. When student built the statue last week, for a few day it became a symbol of the movement for democratic reform and an end to official corruption. On Sunday morning, a tank crushed it. In all, 80 tank and 40 armored personnel carrier lined the northern part of the square. The Monument to Revolutionary Martyrs, where the student took a final stand early Sunday, wa swept clean. Poems and poster calling for a more open China have disappeared from it side. Chinese Red Cross official estimate 3,600 people were killed and 60,000 injured over the weekend, citing a Chinese students' organization, the Union of Chinese Students in West Germany. The government say nearly 300 people, mostly soldier, were killed; diplomat and Chinese say up to 3,000 died. Soldiers drilled in Tiananmen's center, their cadenced shouting echoing around the vast expanse. A crowd of official stood on the roof of the Great Hall of the People, overlooking the square. From this same roof five day earlier official watched a a jubilant mass of demonstrator enveloped 5,000 troop and blocked their entry to the square. Inside the square, soldier could be seen shuffling about, their uniformed jacket stripped off, wash basin in hand. There wa a relaxed air of the inside of an army barrack a unarmed troop carried food and walked slowly together, talking and laughing in group. The area once housing students' tent ha become a holding area for a huge fleet of troop truck. On the southern perimeter, a single line of tank and a cordon of soldier blocked the square from the thousand of bicylists who pedaled slowly by, peering into Tiananmen. Near the square, troop placed barbed wire in front of one street. Soldiers were billeted in a construction site, their laundered fatigue drying on the scaffolding. Next door, troop, their assault rifle slung nonchalantly over their shoulder, stood and chatted outside a discotheque. They look like they , said one local resident.

A Swedish visitor, Tom Hansson, said he saw three people shot to death in clash south of the square. The government is fascist! How can they do this to me? How can they do this to the people? cried a 28-year-old man who wa shot in the leg. Most of those shot on the square were hurling rock at the troop and people close to their front line.

According to him, 11 million people in the province's nine city and 55 county were affected, and more than 200 people died in the natural disaster, with 189,000 room destroyed and 1.2 million hectare of crop ruined. The direct economic loss were set at 10.2 billion yuan. The governor warned that though the flood danger had receded, the determination to fight possible further flood could not slacken, a this is just the beginning: the main flood season, which usually begin in late July and early August, ha not yet arrived. He urged local official to be on constant alert against further possible flood and be meticulous about flood prevention and control measure, while doing their utmost to help flood victim, assisting them to resume production a soon a possible and maintaining social stability. Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Floods have all receded along Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang except at a section of the Xijiang River in Wuzhou city, Guangxi, a spokesman from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters announced today. The spokesman attributed the falling water level to the major water conservancy project which help to mitigate loss. Meanwhile, he said, tension ha been eased in the Pearl River delta a the latest tropical storm ha been weakened after landing in Yangjiang city, Guangdong Province. Floods hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujiang and Zhejiang province following the first heavy rain and flood which typically hit China from the south to the north from June to August. Earlier report said that successive torrential rainstorm in the Xijiang and Beijiang river valley in early and mid-June resulted in a big flood, one of the most serious in 100 year, in Guangdong Province and caused heavy loss. Major flood monitoring station on the two river recorded their highest water level, all four meter above the warning level. In an urgent conference late yesterday, the Guangdong provincial government urged locality to help flood victim with food, shelter, clothing and medical care so that no one would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in the flooded area. The province ha allocated 300 million kg of grain and 110 million yuan in cash along with over 10 million ton of such farm production supply a chemical fertilizer and diesel oil to the flood-stricken area. Meanwhile, 740 million yuan in loan and another 50 million yuan in donation have also been sent to flooded area in Guangdong Province. While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi Province, through which the Ganjiang flow, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded area should work hard to mitigate loss through their own effort and with support from various department. While inspecting Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi, and Fengcheng, Xingang, Jian and Taihe, on June 24-26, Wen said the key to mitigating economic loss is to resume production a soon a possible. The locality should waste no time in implementing various measure to resume production and rehabilitate their homeland, he said. As one of China's major bread basket, Jiangxi is of key importance to China in agricultural production, Wen said. It ha a direct bearing on the grain supply in south China. He urged the local government to farmer resume agricultural production. The following is a recorded report filed by this station's reporter on the front line of the province's battle against the flooding yesterday. [Begin recording] Dear audience, it is now almost noon on 20 June. I'm reporting in Changshanyuan at the eastern gate of Changsha City. This morning, Provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Maolin, provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu, and some other provincial party and government leader arrived here in Changshayuan, on the front line of the province's flood resistance effort, to direct the fight against the flooding. Governor Chen Bangzhu and vice Governor Zheng Peimin just arrived back in Changsha at about 0700 this morning after attending a Beijing meeting. As soon a they stepped out from the train, they set out for Changshayuan, the front line of the province's flood resistance. I interviewed Governor Chen Bangzhu here on the spot. [Reporter] How are you, Governor Chen? You have inspected some flood-stricken area in Changsha City this morning. Will you please tell our audience something about the province's flood situation? [Governor] This year, Hunan ha been hit by a flood of a severity unseen for the past 100 year in term of both water level and quantity. Over the past few day, the broad mass of Army personnel and people across the province have been bravely fighting the flood and have been making concerted effort to provide disaster relief to afflicted area, with the result that some of the province's key dam have remained sound and economic loss have been reduced to a minimum. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm regard and thanks to the broad mass of Army personnel and people fighting in the front line of the province's battle against the flood. At the moment, the province's flood situation remains very serious, because the water level is still high. According to weather forecast and meteorological report, the province is expecting more rain to fall over the next few day. We will definitely encounter more hardship and difficulty. Under the current circumstance, the broad mass of Army personnel and people across the province should further step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention and disaster relief work, this being an overriding task at the moment. We are full of confidence that, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the broad mass of the Hunan Army personnel and people will be able to overcome the difficulty and hardship caused by natural calamity such a flooding, waterlogging, and so on and will win a complete victory in the on-going flood prevention and disaster relief struggle. [end recording] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest or the second largest flood peak since the liberation of China occurred a few day ago in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang river, water level in these river are dropping slowly; however, high water level will remain in these river for the next few day. Due to interaction of the Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang, the Zhujiang Delta will face a high water-level test. Heavy rainfall over a wide area since mid-June resulted in the largest flood water since liberation of the country in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, and Xiang Jiang river. The flood water in Guangdong's Xi Jiang crested in Gaoyao County on 20 June; the water level in Gaoyao's Xi Jiang dropped to 13.37 meter at 0600 today. A flood peak occured in Bei Jiang in Guangdong's Sanshui at 0400 on 20 June, raising the water level to 10.39 meter -- the largest flood level ever recorded. The water level droppped to 10.16 meter at 0600 today. Drops in water level in Guangdong's Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang do not mean that Guangdong's flooding situation have eased, because flood water in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain at high level for quite long a period and will enter the sea after the two flood water jointly flow through the low-lying Zhujiang Delta. In particular, the sea tide may add to the flood water on 25 June. With these factor combined, the Zhujiang Delta, which ha a developed economy and a forest of factory, will face the most rigorous flood water test since the liberation of the country. The situation in the Xiang Jiang is also not an easy one. The flood peak passed Changsha on 19 June, but the water level at the Changsha Station wa still at 25 meter at 0200 today [1800 GMT 20 June]. Because the water level ha remained high for a long period, several dangerous situation have occured along the river's dike. Dike reinforcing work need to be stepped up. The flood peak in Gan Jiang entered Boyang Lake on 20 June. However, due to continued rain over the last few day, the water level in the upper reach west of Ganzhou ha begun to rise again. At 0800 today, the water level at the Ganzhou Station wa 100.95 meter, 3.45 meter above the warning level.

18,d107g,"Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rain that are needed to end the current US. drought, weather expert warned during a drought symposium here. Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria, said Pat Michaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the symposium. He said the 1988 drought, although not a dry a a 1986 drought in many place, ha drawn much attention because some of the affected area include large medium center. I'm worried . that when the next drought happens, we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem, said Michaels, president of the Association of State Climatologists. Experts said Thursday that the greenhouse effect the warming of the Earth's atmosphere ha brought needed attention to change in the global climate, even though it is not directly related to the drought. Many of the 13 climatologist and meterologists at the symposium agreed that the Earth's temperature is warming, but they debated whether it is a short- or long-term phenomenon and it impact on Earth. However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program in Washington, D.C., said the uncertainty mean policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effect, especially undertaking policy that make sense in their own right. Mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuel, he said, by becoming more energy efficient, replanting forest and investigating alternative energy supply. Scientists have warned in recent year that Earth's atmosphere is gaining in carbon dioxide and other gas, which trap heat and cause the overall temperature to rise. Besides fossil fuel, the depletion of forest in South America ha been blamed for the increase of carbon dioxide and methane. Some have warned that higher temperature will change the character of many country, for example drying out the US. Midwest or melting polar ice cap. The symposium wa sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live. Earlier Thursday, the climatologist were told the movement of planet and the moon and sunspot may help lead to drought in the Southeast. There is some evidence that a Jupiter go around the sun at it fastest point, there are drought condition in the Southeast in the month of April and October, Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer said. However, David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington, said he wa skeptical of Plummer's thesis. There's an enormous number of possibility that one could chase, Rodenhuis said. The next business of the scientist is to . extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect. The crippling drought hitting North America is expected to reduce world grain stock to level that may cause food shortage in many poor country, the UN. Food and Agriculture Organization reported today. The agency project world cereal production in 1988 to total 1.785 billion ton, only two million ton more than last year's level, which wa already below the expected production. If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low level of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported. As a result, world grain stock are projected to fall below 310 million ton, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said. If crop condition in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further. Such a development would have serious implication for the food security, particularly of many low-income, food-deficit country, the report said. The high grain price resulting from a lower supply would hit poor, food-importing country the hardest, the UN. agency warned. It said the rising price could also reduce food aid from developed country. The most severely hit crop are coarse grain mostly maize, barley and oat, the report said. The agency projected good harvest in other part of the world. In Asia the yearly monsoon rain started on time, and production in Europe and the Soviet is expected to be larger than last year. Grain production in South America should be slightly lower this year than last. In the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa, however, locust flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rain have damaged this year's harvest. Potential crop loss from the pest could hit 1 million ton, FAO said. Weather expert discussed the drought Thursday and it possible cause and effect, and said they hoped to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last. All of the speaker at the 1988 Drought Symposium called for more research and study. There's an enormous number of possibility that one could chase. The next business of the scientist is to eliminate the possibility of . and extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect, said David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington. The symposium attended by 13 state and national expert wa sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live. John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said the drought in the Southeast might be lessened or ended in the next few month by a heavier than normal hurricane season. Hope said current weather condition point to more tropical storm, more of which should become hurricane, in this hurricane season. He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable, depending on the intensity and speed of the storm. Nevertheless, he said, some Southeastern state get a much a 25 pecent of their rainfall in some month from hurricane. Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer told the symposium he thought the position of the planet Jupiter had something to do with drought in the Southeast. However, Rodenhuis said he wa skeptical about Plummer's thesis. It's very necessary to be cautious and analytical about the issue, he said. Heavy rain deluged some drought-hit area a Congress began working on a package of relief for America's farmer, and farmer in Kentucky today greeted the arrival of the first shipment of hay airlifted free from Oregon. Everything look so good with a bit of rain over the past 24 hour, farmer Herman Krone said Tuesday at his 2,800-acre farm in southern Illinois, which President Reagan plan to visit Thursday during a tour of the drought-stricken area. However, Krone said, almost one-third of his 1,200 acre of corn already have been lost. Marth Wilkinson, wife of Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and business manager of the family's farm, wa at Louisville's Standiford Field today for the arrival of the first hay shipment from Portland, Ore. United Parcel Service plan to ship free of charge 20 to 30 ton of hay from Portland to Louisville each day for the next two week. The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, issued a report predicting severe damage to the harvest from the drought. It estimated, for example, that corn output this year would shrivel to 5.2 billion bushel, down from 7.06 billion last year. The dry weather is the largest drought that our nation ha ever experienced, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told legislator. I think history will show that it's truly more mammoth than any of u ha ever experienced. Extremely heavy rain fell Tuesday in section of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. In Texas, more than 6{ inch fell in 75 minute in Mesquite, washing a pickup truck and several car into a creek and leaving some home 8 inch deep in water. Water wa up to the top of car in Garland and street flooding wa reported in Heath. Nearly 6 inch fell in DeQueen, Ark. Showers and thunderstorm were widespread over the Middle Atlantic States, the Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast state. Thunderstorms boomed today over the Dakotas and Minnesota. In Washington, the House and Senate Agriculture committee began working on wide-ranging legislation that would provide payment of up to $100,000 each to farmer whose crop have been wiped out by the dry spell. House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, called for final action on the measure by mid-August. The drought ha dried up pasture, forcing livestock farmer to go far afield for hay. The hay that arrived in Kentuky today will be stored at a fairground, and distributed next week by lottery to farmer, who will pay for the hay, official said. It seems like everyone in the state want this hay, state Department of Agriculture spokesman Roger Nesbitt said Tuesday. The delay ha angered some farmer, such a Bernetta Smith, who expects to run out of hay for her 147 beef cow in one to two day. I don't see any sense in storing it because people need this hay. I don't understand it, she said. At least 50 truckloads of hay gathered from the Carolinas and Virginia are being shipped to Ohio on Thursday in a drive organized by the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. Despite the recent rain, community with dried-up water supply continue to restrict water use. Until the drought end, the 650 resident of Vintondale, Pa., about 50 mile east of Pittsburgh, will have to do without running water from 7 pm. to 7 am. every day, Mayor Michael Palovich said Tuesday. Palovich said he wa trying to arrange for an emergency supply to be trucked in. The drought ha had a silver lining for angler in the Reno, Nevada, area. The state Board of Wildlife Commissioners removed the limit on catch at Rye Patch and Lahontan reservoir because the reservoir are expected to be dry by the end of summer, leaving fish high and dry. Here is a state-by-state summary of drought development Wednesday: Weather forecaster today were offering drought-stricken farmer little prospect of relief in separate outlook for the next 30 day and three month. A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said many area now experiencing extreme drought have le than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 month. The disappointing forecast came a President Reagan headed to the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farm. On Tuesday the Agriculture Department reported sharp decline in the outlook for several crop. That wa followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken area from the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short of rain. That area, which includes the major grain-growing state where crop already are suffering, is given a 55 percent chance of le than normal rainfall. And some state in the center of the area, stretching from West Virginia to Nebraska and from Wisconsin to Missouri, may be even drier. They are given a 60 percent chance of being short of precipitation. A slice of southern California, including Los Angeles, is the driest area in the forecast, with a 70 percent chance of having below normal rainfall. The rest of coastal California also will be dry, the forecast said. The outlook also say there's a 55 percent chance of hotter than normal temperature through the US. heartland from New England to Idaho and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma. Within that area, the chance of high temperature are above 65 percent in Wyoming, while central Midwestern state have a 60 percent chance of above average temperature. Wetter than normal weather is predicted for west and south Texas, and part of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Normal precipitation is forecast for the Atlantic and Gulf coast state, along with the Northwest and northern Mountain States. The Weather Service said normal temperature are expected for the Atlantic state from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast state. West Texas and New Mexico may be cooler than normal, but the far West is expected to see it normal quota of summer heat. The separate drought impact assessment, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, point out that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing, since dry spell have no normal lifetime. The low 4 percent probability of an end within 3 month is based simply on a statistical analysis of past drought, the agency said. The report noted that a of the end of June, 29 percent of the continental United States wa experiencing severe or extreme drought, with part of 35 state affected. That put the current drought on the same level a the one in 1911, but still le severe than the drought of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934. Kentucky's governor ha criticized the federal government for being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor warns that farmer in his state still face potential disaster despite up to five inch of rain over the weekend. Crews began installing pump on barge Monday to haul fresh water to southern Louisiana town plagued by rising salt level in the lower Mississippi River. Meanwhile, House Speaker Jim Wright said in Washington he hope that a relief package with disaster payment of up to $100,000 for drought-stricken farmer will win committee approval and be ready for floor action in Congress this week. Here is a state-by-state summary of the latest drought developments: The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage control next year to help the United States rebuild it grain inventory, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday. But the United States will continue to be a major player in world agriculture and in 1989 should be able to bounce back from this year's drought loss, he said. Lyng's remark were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editor. A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree of drought stress in May and June than at any point since record began in 1895, he said. Moreover, on July 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous United States wa in the severe to extreme drought category, he said. In 1934, more than 60 percent wa so rated, and in August 1954 more than 50 percent wa in that category. Because of the large early season area now experiencing drought in the U.S., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the drought-affected area of the 1930s and 1950s, Lyng said. Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grain and livestock feed grain so that the United States will be able to take care of our domestic need and our export demand, he said. Lyng said total consumption of 1988 crop will probably be somewhat le than previously estimated because price are much higher. But it is important to note that we will have no shortage, that we will still be able to accommodate the need of our overseas buyer, he said.

If conditions continue, the areas affect could exceed the 60 percent of 1934 and the 50 percent of 1954. The drought has caused grain and soybean futures to drop and grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of what is considered necessary to safeguard world food security. Many poorer nations could face food shortages as grain prices rise. Many communities from Iowa to Alabama face water shortages that leave officials seeking alternate water supplies. Other areas have imposed bans on outdoor water use. Heavy storms which have spread across the nation have brought deluges to Texas and Arkansas, tornados to Kansas, and damaging high winds to Michigan and Indiana but water restrictions will remain in effect for the immediate future. Kentucky received its first of hay from Oregon.

19,d110h,"THE INVASION: Iraq's troop, led by about 350 tank, crossed the border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and government building 40 mile away. Early Friday, the invader controlled Kuwait city, the capital. The soldier were also making sweep through the southern oilfield, according to resident and Lloyds' insurance service in London. Diplomatic source estimate more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion. Kuwait's Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia. THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, ha the Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldier on the Kuwaiti border. Kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, ha 1.9 million resident 60 percent foreigner and an army of 20,300 soldier. CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing oil from it territory and forcing down oil price through overproduction. Kuwait and UN. diplomat dismissed Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary. REACTION: The UN. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion. President Bush denounced it a naked agression. He froze Iraq's asset in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi import, including oil. The order also froze Kuwait property under US. jurisdiction a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it. The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arm sale to Iraq. Kuwait's US. ambassador said the nation had asked for American military intervention. A Pentagon source said a US. naval group wa diverted toward the Persian Gulf. Oil price soared in frenzied trading amid fear the invasion would reduce the supply of oil. Administration and congressional official agree that the CIA did it job. Since last week, President Bush had been warned by intelligence analyst that what originally looked like a military bluff wa quickly turning into the kind of troop deployment that could be used to invade Kuwait or even Saudi Arabia. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster even hand-delivered certain fresh detail on the Iraqi buildup to National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Among the assessment he conveyed wa a conclusion that, by this week, President Saddam Hussein's force would be capable of penetrating Kuwait or Saudi Arabia. The agency lacked hard evidence of an intent to invade, intelligence official say. But a the buildup grew, the CIA became more alarmed, partly because Mr. Hussein is so unpredictable, and partly because, unlike many other Arab leader, he ha been known to carry out his threat. Saudi Arabia ha been subdued in it reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which place Iraqi force near the oil-rich kingdom's border. Oil executive said Saudi Arabia ha not and will not take the most potent action possible against Iraq closing the pipeline that carry Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea. The executive said the Saudis believe this would give Iraq's belligerent president, Saddam Hussein, an excuse to attack and occupy Saudi oil field 150 mile south of Kuwait, giving Iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world. The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion wa made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press Agency the day after the Iraqi move. The statement said Saudi Arabia wa following the Kuwait situation with extreme concern and that King Fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the interest of all. The statement did not condemn the invasion. The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwaiti government in the wake of the invasion wa to shelter member of the ruling family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the crown prince. Both nation are tightly run by royal family and have been close ally. The Saudis also allowed the Kuwaiti royal family to briefly operate a radio, reportedly from a mobile van, in the area around the Saudi-Kuwait border. But Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call: The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brother, oh Arabs, oh beloved brother, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help. It wa not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Saddam at a time when fear were being expressed that he might invade Saudi Arabia a well. Saudi Arabia border Kuwait and Iraq's invasion force were reportedly near the Saudi border. The Saudis did condemned the invasion a part of a joint statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is allied with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. The six state issued a statement saying, We strongly condemn and are very sorry for this attack that one Arab state took against another Arab state. . We do not recognize anything resulting from it. Iraq's 1-million-member armed force is clearly too much for the joint 3,000-member Gulf Cooperation Council force or Saudi Arabia's 65,700-member army. Saudi Arabia wa also one of the 14 member of the 21-member Arab League that condemned the invasion in the same term a the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Arab League, with one-third of it member voting against the resolution or abstaining, wa clearly unable to take any direct action. Turkey ha also refused to take action and ha not commented about President Bush's suggestion that it cut off Iraq's oil pipeline to the Mediterranean. Two parallel pipeline pump Iraqi crude oil to a terminal at Yumurtalik at the eastern corner of Turkey's Mediterranean coast and constitute Iraq's major oil export outlet. Ruling party member said today that the government, fearing a US. air attack, wa distributing automatic weapon to ten of thousand of supporter and preparing to evacuate the Iraqi capital. A boycott of Iraqi oil forced Baghdad today to close one of two pipeline in Turkey that were pumping the bulk of Iraq's exported oil, Turkish official said. A British official said Iraqi troop rounded up American and British visitor in Kuwait and taking them to Iraq. The Foreign Office spokesman said most were passenger from a British Airways flight stranded in Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion Thursday. There is no evidence that they are in any way in trouble, the official said. Saudi Arabia wa reported reinforcing it troop along the Kuwaiti border following concern Iraq may try to invade it. Pentagon source said the USS Independence and it carrier battle group are now on station in the Arabian Sea, a position that would allow it to launch fighter plane into the Persian Gulf region. Gulf-based diplomat said soldier from the American rapid deployment force, formed to react to crisis in the Middle East, had been dispatched to the area. In other developments: The new Kuwait government installed by Iraq hinted it might take hostage or seize property of nation that take punitive measure against Iraq. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said the 100,000 soldier who invaded Kuwait began to pull back Sunday. President Bush said Iraq wa lying. Oil price jumped more than $3 a barrel on news Europe and Japan were joining the embargo of Iraqi oil. Stocks slumped worldwide. Hospital official said at least 300 Kuwaiti and Iraqi soldier were killed during the invasion. In London, Kuwaitis arriving on a special plane said 700 Kuwaitis died. The embargo of Iraqi oil grew over the weekend to include Japan and the European Community. Along with the United States, they bought more than half Iraq's exported oil, with most of it pumped through Turkey. An official of the state-run Turkish pipeline company BOTAS said pumping stopped at one of the two Turkish pipeline at 5 pm. Iraq reduced flow in the second, wider, pipeline to 70 percent of capacity, they said. There wa no comment from Iraq. The two pipeline pump Iraqi crude from Kirkuk oil field in northern Iraq to a terminal at the northeastern tip of the Mediterranean. They carry 70 million ton of crude annually, providing the outlet for the major share of Iraqi export. The BOTAS official said all the country participating in the embargo purchase their Iraqi crude from the Turkish outlet. Iraq also export oil through a Saudi Arabian pipeline and via tanker in the northern Persian Gulf. A Foreign Office spokesman said today a saying a total of 366 people had been assembled by Iraqi troop in Kuwait, mostly passenger from a stranded British Airways flight. They were being transported by bus to the Iraqi border. Baghdad did not give any reason for it action. Immediately after the invasion Thursday, 11 Americans were rounded up by Iraqi troop. They turned up safe in Baghdad. The new Iraqi-installed foreign minister of Kuwait, Lt. Col. Walid Sa'oud Mohammed Abdullah, warned against further sanction in a statement broadcast Sunday by Iraqi radio. Countries that resort to punitive measure against the provisional free Kuwait government and fraternal Iraq should remember that they have interest and national in Kuwait, he said. Iraqi soldier invaded Kuwait after complaining that it violation of OPEC production quota wa driving down world crude price, lowering Iraqi oil revenue. Saddam also accused Kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes land both side claim. The respected Middle East Economic Survey reported today that Kuwait's oil export facility had been shut down. It also said there wa considerable doubt Saudi Arabia, with the world's largest oil reserve, would be willing to make up the potential world oil shortage. Kuwait and Iraq together account for one-fifth of the 23.5 million barrel produced daily by the 13 OPEC nation. Tensions remained high in the region; a US. official said in Washington that Iraqi troop massed on the Kuwaiti-Saudi border were apparently digging in. An American technician at a secret Saudi Arabian base said the kingdom had sent 200 to 300 tank toward it border with Kuwait. Oil industry source in Saudi Arabia reached by telephone from Bahrain said Saudi troop were entering the region of Khafji, near the border. Residents reached by telephone reported intense air activity near the Saudi airport overnight. The Washington Post reported today that Egypt wa mobilizing some element of it armed force to assist Saudi Arabia in the event of an invasion. US. official said there wa no indication Iraqi troop were preparing to invade Saudi Arabia. But Bush sent Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to the kingdom to confer with it leader, and the White House said Secretary of State James A. Baker would go this week to Turkey. Saadi Mehdi Saleh, the Iraqi army commander, wa quoted by the Al-Iraq newspaper a saying ten of thousand of volunteer had joined the army to defend what he called Iraq and the revolution in Kuwait. Americans, he wa quoted a saying, should understand that the people of the great leader Saddam Hussein cannot be frightened. Local member of the ruling Baath party said preparation were under way to evacuate all of Baghdad's 4 million people to camp outside the city. They were being told that the US. Air Force might attack or that Israel might attack with chemical or nuclear weapon. The party member also said the party had distributed gun, mainly AK-47 automatic rifle, to ten of thousand of people around the country. State radio said Saddam had ordered the formation of 11 new Iraqi army division, expected to generate 100,000 troop. The Arab world's most formidible military force is already estimated at 1 million men. At a border checkpoint 30 mile south of the Iraqi port city of Basra, dozen of tank, armored personnel carrier and truck carrying hundred of soldier crossed back into Iraq on Sunday. But thousand of Iraqi soldier remained behind in Kuwait, controlling major government building, commerical center and port. Diplomats in the region said a new Kuwaiti army fanned out through Kuwait. The force comprises about 80,000 troop, mostly Iraqis. The nine-member Kuwaiti military government, announced by Iraq on Saturday, remained a mystery. No photograph of the named leader have been shown and 12 reporter brought to Kuwait by the Ministry of Information could not locate any of them. Kuwaiti diplomat said they were all Iraqis, including a son-in-law of Saddam, a charge official Iraqi medium denied. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problem and fulfill territorial ambition by dethroning the government of neighboring Kuwait. The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflected the brutality Saddam ha used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 1979. The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the president considered Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to Iraq. Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting neck is better than cutting mean of living. Oh God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them, he said last month after price tumbled below $14 per barrel. He accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quota assigned by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border, and demanded that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraq during the Persian Gulf war. Saddam wa reported to be incensed that Kuwait wa demanding repayment for the wartime loan. Saddam said he fought the war to protect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly Shiite Moslem Iran. Never mind that Iraq started the war in 1980 by invading Iran after a series of border skirmish along the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf. Despite claim that the war wa an unprecedented victory, the long conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging on for eight year. It ha still not formally ended. The war bill kept the government from delivering material benefit promised to the Iraqi people directly after the war. The 1990 budget slashed fund for import and Iraqis were told to brace for another year of austerity. Private investment ha failed to take hold. Iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt. Its main gulf port of Basra is still blocked and it oil infrastructure damaged. Tens of thousand of Iraqi prisoner of war languish in Iranian prison and an estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded. Despite it puny size, Kuwait's oil reserve almost match Iraq's 100 billion barrel. By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstanding wish for more gulf coastline. Iraq's 100,000 troop massed at the border in the past few week were believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulate to Iraq's demand. But Kuwait's pledge two week ago to obey new OPEC quota and Saddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he would not invade lulled the Arab world into the sense the crisis wa over. Homage to the cause of Arab unity ha been paramount in Middle East politics since postwar independence from colonial power. Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s brought Egyptian and Saudi Arabian intervention on opposing side, no Arab state ha ever directly deposed the government of a fellow Arab League member. Despite Iraqi claim that it is helping internal opposition liberate Kuwait, it ha long coveted the tiny emirate. The Iraqi government refused to recognize it independence in 1961 and threatened to attack then, but backed down when Britain landed troop in Kuwait. The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbor along the Gulf. It proved the decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that group Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait wa toothless. The GCC did not issue a statement, much le implement it mutual defense treaty. While Iraq wa unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use the precedent of Kuwait to browbeat it neighbor on local policy issue. Bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to Kuwait when it balked at Iraqi demand. Also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarch, the fall of one make the rest feel extremely vulnerable. In a series of bellicose statement in recent month, Saddam ha sought to focus domestic attention outside Iraq. In March he threatened to burn half of Israel with Iraq's chemical weapon banned under international law if Iraq wa attacked. It wa a popular stance among Arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a Palestinian nation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Then Britain arrested several people on charge they were smuggling nuclear trigger into Baghdad. Weeks later, police in Europe impounded what they said wa part to a supergun capable of firing chemical or nuclear shell into Israel. Saddam cried foul, claiming the West wa trying to wreck the scientific progress of the Arabs. Saddam ha sought to inherit the mantle of the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nassar a the leader of the Arab world. His relentless personality cult ha dubbed him The Knight of the Arabs. For Kuwait on Thursday, he wa a dark knight. Asked the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador to Washington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said at a news conference: Ambition. Hegemony. Control of the whole area. There is not any reason for it. Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiator embraced warmly Tuesday a they began talk on their oil and border dispute, source said. Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed 100,000 troop on Kuwait's border. Gulf-based diplomatic source said the Iraqi force, triple the number earlier reported, included about 300 Soviet-made tank, and dwarfed the entire Kuwaiti army of 20,000 troop. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the troop have been concentrated along the border since last week, when Iraq began threatening Kuwait. Iraq accused the small Persian Gulf state of stealing oil from a disputed border region and forcing oil price to drop. The diplomat said the number of troop wa at first difficult to determine. The delegation leader, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah of Kuwait, and Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, met privately for two hour. There were no detail on the negotiation, but source said the meeting will continue Wednesday. Diplomatic source have said they expect Arab mediator to push the two side to sign a treaty of non-belligerency to be followed by protracted negotiation on border and compensation. The Iraq-Kuwait crisis broke out on July 17 when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of driving down oil price by exceeding quota set for them by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saddam said the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost revenue. Saddam also demanded compensation for the $2.4 billion in oil he claimed Kuwait pumped illegally from an oil field which straddle the unmarked border between the two country. Iraq also demanded that Kuwait forgive $15 billion in loan it extended to Baghdad during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's tough talk appeared to have succeeded. Kuwait and the U.A.E agreed to stick to their oil quota at an OPEC meeting last week. OPEC member state also agreed to a longstanding Iraqi demand to raised target crude oil price from $18 to $21 a barrel. Kuwaiti and Iraqi official agreed to meet in Jiddah after intensive mediation effort by King Fahd and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Kuwaiti leader had insisted that Iraq pull back it troop before conciliation talk could began, but later dropped that demand. Kuwaiti official also asked that Iraq agree to demarcate the disputed border between the nation, a move Iraq ha refused. Iraq ha historically laid claim to all of Kuwait and ha long coveted the Kuwaiti island of Bubiyan and Warba, which command access to Iraq's sole outlet into the Persian Gulf. The mediator have succeeded in toning down a vitriolic campaign against Kuwait by the Iraqi state-run medium. On Tuesday, the Iraqi delegation left Baghdad without any public announcement. The leading Al-Thawra daily newspaper called the Jiddah meeting an opportunity . for Kuwait . to perceive Iraq's demand and respond to it right. In contrast, the Kuwaiti delegation left for Jiddah with fanfare and publicity. The Kuwaiti paper said they hoped the Jiddah meeting wa the start of a final just settlement of the difference between Iraq and Kuwait, in a manner ensuring the legitimate right of each. UNITED NATIONS The United States urged other UN. member at talk Sunday to impose broad economic and military sanction on Iraq. Western diplomat said the world body is expected to adopt the measure. Should the UN. Security Council impose comprehensive sanction, it would be the first time since 1967 it ha taken such action against a member state. The last time such sanction were imposed wa against the white minority government of Rhodesia. Western diplomat said they expected up to 14 positive vote on the 15-member council for sanction against Iraq. They said they expected no veto, allowing the legally binding measure to be adopted, probably on Monday. They said Cuba wa the holdout. US. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporter after closed-door talk Sunday that the council discussed the absolute necessity of moving ahead toward a broad resolution of sanction. He said he expected a vote Monday. Pickering said the United States had circulated six or seven draft of a detailed resolution. It call for an embargo on Iraq's oil export, an embargo on import to Iraq, and a halt to all arm and other military supply for Iraq. British Ambassador Crispen Tickell told reporter later that he detected strong support, with the exception of one member, for action and a vote tomorrow. Speaking of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Canadian Ambassador L. Yves Fortier declared, This madman must be stopped. Cuban envoy Ricardo Alarcon said Cuba would vote for sanction against Iraq only if the council imposed sanction on South Africa for occupying Namibia, Israel for occupying Palestinian territory and the United States for invading Panama. In Kuwait, the Iraqi-installed provisional government, in a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, told other country to refrain from taking punishing measure against it or Iraq. The provisional government said country have to remember they have interest and citizen in Kuwait. Kuwait's UN. Ambassador Mohammad Abulhasan told reporter that the Iraqi-installed government wa employing pure blackmail by saying it could not ensure the safety of foreigner if their government support sanction. In Aspen, Colo., British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher renewed her call for the United Nations to apply a total economic embargo against Iraq unless it withdraws immediately from Kuwait. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait defies every principle for which the UN. stand. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel safe again. The law of the jungle take over, she said, in remark at the Aspen Institute. The UN. role in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis assumed increasing importance after divided Arab nation cancelled an emergency summit on the invasion. On Thursday, the Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion, demanded immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal, and threatened to impose sanction if Iraq did not pull out. Sunday's session wa scheduled after weekend meeting of the council's five permanent member the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France and between the United States and representative of the Non-Aligned Movement. They are the nation with the power to veto proposal. The United States contends that stiff sanction by a united international front are necessary to punish Iraq and to force it to withdraw from Kuwait, which wa invaded Thursday. An emergency Arab League Council failed to publicly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday and adjourned it meeting for 24 hour a Arab leader held urgent consultation on how to handle the crisis. Kuwait's Cabinet affair minister, Abdel-Rahman el-Awadi told reporter he asked the 21-nation Arab League to condemn the attack. He accused Iraq of using the law of the jungle. President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein met in Alexandria and telephoned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President Bush, Saudi King Fahd and Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh on the crisis. Hussein later left for home. Sources close to the Arab League Council said it member agreed to convene an emergency Arab summit but decided to leave the when and where up to Arab leader. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. The Council meeting of foreign minister wa convened in Cairo at Kuwaiti request hour after Iraqi military force took over the small Persian Gulf state. Some member nation sent lower-level representative. Following it evening session, attended by Saadoon Hamadi, a member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Council, Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt told reporter the Council would meet again Friday. Saddam promised Mubarak two week ago that he would not invade Kuwait in their oil dispute. At Thursday's closed session, Hamadi reiterated Iraq's claim it force entered Kuwait at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had overthrown the government. A conference source said several Arab foreign minister replied that they considered this to be an Iraqi invasion which is against all United Nations and Arab League convention. So far, only Lebanon's prime minister and foreign minister, Salim Hoss, ha joined Kuwait in Cairo in publicly condemning the invasion the first time in modern history one Arab country invaded another to take control of the government. Hoss told reporter, We do not see any justification for what happened, whatever the argument and pretext. The invasion wa denounced by the United States and other Western nation and by the Soviet Union. The Arab League Council met early Thursday and then adjourned to await the arrival of Hamdoon. Iraq's ambassador to Egypt, Nabil Najm, sat in until Hamdoon arrived. The United Nation's Security Council ha condemned the invasion and the issue is now being discussed within the framework of the Arab League and we hope that it will issue a condemnation within the hour and that Arabs stand against this invasion, Kuwait's Awadi said. Arab leader must take the initiative and stop this bloodshed and return thing to their normal situation. We also call on Iraq to withdraw it troop. Hamadi told reporter upon arrival, I see this meeting a unnecessary . There is no government presently in Kuwait. There is a group which started the revolution and which will reveal itself shortly. His comment were carried by the Middle East News Agency. MENA said Kuwait invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact and asked the Arab League Council to dispatch a joint Arab force to defend Kuwait against the invasion. In the event of military aggression against any League member, the pact all member, to take, individually and collectively, all step available, including the use of armed force, to repel the aggression and restore security and peace. The minister were in Cairo to attend the Organization of Islamic Conference's foreign minister meeting. All Arab League member also belong to the Islamic conference. The UN. Security Council today overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanction against Iraq, including a ban on oil purchase, to punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait. The vote wa 13-0, with two abstention by Cuba and Yemen on the 15-member council, which adopted the sanction resolution proposed by the United States. It said Iraq had launched an armed attack against Kuwait and usurped the authority of Kuwait's legitimate government. The sanction were intended to force Iraq to withdraw it troop from Kuwait and the resolution ban the import into their territory of all commodity and product originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution. President Bush praised the decision and called for full and total implementation of these sanction, ruling out nothing at all. He told reporter at the White House: The will of nation around the world will be to enforce these sanction. It wa the third time in it 45-year existence that the world body had voted sanction against a member state. The last time wa 1967 when the Security Council voted similar, comprehensive sanction against the white minority government of Rhodesia. An arm embargo against South Africa still is in effect. The sanction are legally binding for all member nation, although past council resolution have often been ignored or flouted. The United Nations ha no enforcement mechanism but later could call on member to take military action against Iraq or impose a blockade. The vote followed similar sanction imposed on Iraq by much of the West, including the United States, Japan and the European Community. The Soviet Union and China said they would halt arm shipment to Iraq. In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nation not to take punishing measure against it or Iraq. The provisional government said country have to remember they have interest and citizen in Kuwait.

Neither Kuwait nor Iraq is on the 15-member council. The representative of Yemen said he did not vote because he had not received instruction from his government. Britain's UN. envoy, Crispin Tickell, condemned the invasion a an ugly moment in world affair. Kuwait is a former British colony. The United States ha made it clear that it will stand shoulder to shoulder with Kuwait in this time of crisis, US. Ambassador Thomas Pickering told the council. It is our understanding that the present aggression wa completely unprovoked. Baghdad radio claimed Iraq had come to the aid of revolutionary youth in Kuwait whom it said had toppled the Kuwaiti government. Kuwait's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Abulhasan, denied the invasion wa in response to a call from help from a new government.

Most died in structure thatcollapsed when the quake hit.It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, said RussNeedham, a geophysicist with the US. Geological Survey.The Armenian quake wa measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, butThursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7according to the US. Geological Survey.In the Iranian quake, the casualty count wa pushed up by thefact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just aftermidnight. Many of the victim lived in fragile home built of aceramic-type brick or adobe that collapse easily.In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report laterblamed the high number of fatality on shoddily built buildings.Most casualty from earthquake are caused by somethingfalling on top of you, said Needham in a telephone interview fromGolden, Colo.The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the building arebuilt on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shift in anearthquake and allows structure to collapse, Needham said.The 7.7-magnitude quake wa the largest ever recorded in thatarea, where two major plate of the earth's crust meet, he said.Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and thatthere have been many smaller quakes.Twelve earthquake greater than magnitude 7 have occurred inIran during the last 30 year, Needham said.A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capableof widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.Planes loaded with food, medicine and tentsare converging on earthquake-stricken Iran from around the world,among them the first private American relief mission to the countryin more than a decade.Authorities now are faced with the difficult task of gettingsupplies into the affected area.

Bothbeermakers claim their package are the largest Super Bowlpromotions ever, with each planning to spend upwards of $7 million.Anheuser Busch is staging a Bud Bowl II ad campaign thatculminates during the Jan. 28 Super Bowl, with a game featuringanimated team of Budweiser and Bud Light beer bottle rattlingaround on a pint-sized football field. The first such game wasstaged during the last Super Bowl.We're starting a month earlier, we've added an extra promospot and we're going to have a lot more display material in thestores, said Tom Sharbaugh, group brand director for Budweiser.Miller, based in Milwaukee, won't say exactly how much it isspending on it 12-week, pre-Super Bowl campaign centered on afootball game between a Tastes Great team and a LessFilling squad.Those team will be made up of current and former NationalFootball League player such a Bert Jones, LC. Greenwood and JoeKlecko.We're spending more than $7 million, I can tell you that,said Richard Burton, advertising manager for Lite beer. We'retalking about real-life talent.Miller's campaign culminates Jan. 14, two week before the SuperBowl, primarily because Anheuser Busch bought all the Super Bowltelevision spot allocated for beer advertising.Miller's television commercial already have started airing.Anheuser Busch will begin it ad this week with a spot featuringsports announcer Brent Musberger.Both company also have fan participation promotions.Anheuser Busch expects to receive 400,000 to 500,000 scorecardsfrom fan who are being asked to write down the score of the BudBowl after each quarter. Fans who send in their scorecard willreceive a commemorative pin.Miller ha a consumer sweepstakes offering expense-paid trip tothe Super Bowl.Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertiser to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend for an all-out bash. Along with getting seat for Sunday's game, the guest will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel. The magazine is just one of hundred of business whose official and customer will be among the 104,000 fan attending the Super Bowl. And the company show few sign of cutting back on their activity despite the new tax law's tighter restriction on what can be claimed a a business-entertainment expense. Still, the new rule do change thing for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the cost. One big change under the new law limit business-entertainment deduction for ticket to sporting event like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such ticket can be deducted. If a company purchase a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 -- the going rate -- it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60. Even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a ""substantial and bona fide business discussion"" before, during or after the game, say Julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc. To take a client to a game a merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough, Mr. Block say. And if a company want to simply give client ticket to the game, the business gift carry a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient. The tougher IRS rule, however, hasn't slowed ticket demand; even end-zone seat are fetching $500 each. ""Even if it weren't tax deductible, it'd be worth it,"" say Tom Foley, chairman of Bibb Co., a Macon, Ga., maker of home furnishing and textile product that use the National Football League team logo. Bibb is flying about 20 people -- mostly customer -- to the game. ""We get more earnings from the trip than the expense,"" say Mr. Foley. Some company say they are making adjustment or at least educating their executive about the new rule. A spokesman for Adolph Coors & Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, said it tax adviser instructed executive that ""this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discus business."" Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, a long a there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game. Meals are now 80% deductible a long a business is discussed. Under the old law, meal were fully deductible and all a company had to do wa show a business relationship with the guest. Companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-Super Bowl banquet, since the new tax law ha a ""banquet meeting exception."" Such meeting must have at least 40 person, half of whom are away from home, and there must be a speaker. Executives who bring client over to the house to watch the Super Bowl on television also face new restriction on deduction for food and liquor, say William J. Lipton, tax partner of the accounting firm Ernst & Whinney. If a host want to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guest, Mr. Lipton say. One safety measure: Make a business-oriented speech, Mr. Block suggests. He also advises party host to keep a guest list and note their business connection. That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guest including business leader, entertainment personality and customer. Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, say the bash is tax deductible because ""our sale people will be there and business will be discussed."" He admits, however, ""We're not going to twist any arm. We're there to say thank-you to those who've given u business."" An IRS spokesman say more agent will be assigned to corporate audit of business-entertainment expense this year. But IRS enforcement of the rule could be a difficult a blocking the New York Giants' Lawrence Taylor. ""As a practical matter, a long a people say they talked business at a Super Bowl party, how can the IRS dispute it?"" say Vickie King, a Price Waterhouse tax official. ""The only people who will get into trouble are those who don't keep receipts.""President Bush congratulated the San Francisco49ers on Friday and said they rewrote the record book withtheir Super Bowl victory. In turn he wa presented with twoautographed ball and a jogging outfit.Let me congratulate you also on your victory, quarterback JoeMontana told Bush at a East Room reception.

But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper.

In the Indian accident, monsoon rains may have contributed as well as overcrowding.  Even an advanced country such as Israel can experience ferry accidents.  Nineteen U.S. sailors died when an Israeli ferry sank while returning the sailors to the USS Saratoga.  No cause was reported."

The broadcast ended with aninstrumental version of Yesterday playing a temperature fromaround the nation rolled across the screen.The celebration wa a dramatic turnabout from Sovietauthorities' repression of Beatles fan and supression of theirmusic in earlier time. Their music wa banned and the Soviet presscondemned them. A 1964 article, for instance, commented, Thesebugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.About 1,000 Soviets, mostly second generation Beatles fans,flocked to the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall innortheastern part of the city to rejoice in Lennon's music. Aplaque outside the hall reminded Beatles fan that Lennon's nearnamesake, Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, hadspoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919.Inside, fan listened to recording of Lennon's music, attendeda concert of about a dozen Soviet rock band, bought his album andposters and reflected on his life.He's like a hero, a symbol for every person: a symbol ofhonesty, talent, devotion to his ideal, notion of love, equalitybetween people and goodness, said Irina Dykomkina, the21-year-old secretary of the Sgt. Pepper's Club, a Soviet Beatlesfan club formed two year ago.Lennon's music, she said, cross border easily.His music is so sincere, it's so understandable, even topeople who don't know English. They feel the music.Andrei Trushkin, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda - theCommunist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday toLennon - said he appeal to Soviet youth in part because he wa arebel, like many of them, and wa a difficult teen-ager.The cop would have locked him up many time, said Trushkin,who helped organize the concert.Tuesday's concert opened in the spirit of a birthday party.Balloons floated down from the balcony a a tape of Lennon'ssong, Starting Over, played. The stage wa adorned with apainting of Lennon and life-size cardboard cutout of the Fab Fourin front of the British flag.Oorah! Oorah! shouted the audience, which included a fewsoldiers in uniform. Onstage, the group Sprint, Quiet Hour andOptimal Variant played in Beatles style but were joined by a groupthat didn't quite fit in the genre, an American-style countryensemble that wore plaid vest and performed Night Train toMemphis.When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman begandigging into The Lives of John Lennon, his first move wa tomail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.She wa Numero Uno, you've got to start with her. I sent her asincere letter, because at that time I wa a true believer inrock's greatest love story. . I told her, `I'm in your corner,'Goldman recalled.Ono never responded. And after 1,200 interview and 6{ years,the dream wa over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the Greataltered.Expecting the best, Goldman claim to have uncovered the worst:a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes ofrock 'n' roll, tucked in his Dakota bed for day at a time.That vision of the ex-Beatle ha infuriated Lennon supporters,family and friend and prompted charge of fiction writing; it alsotaught Goldman who say he is a John Lennon fan a hard lesson.It doesn't pay to meet your idol. Just enjoy them; don't tryto see the reality, Goldman said. My book are a cold dose ofreality. You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goescold.Goldman, whose past tell-all biography dealt with ElvisPresley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry fromthe music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, PaulMcCartney.My book are bad for business, Goldman said in a phoneinterview from Munich, West Germany. They're bad for Paul'sbusiness, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rockbusiness. Those people have to hate me.Myth-shattering is a not a bad thing, Goldman said. For example,he cite Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Gracelandin 1965.John wa very hooked into Elvis. Elvis wa his measure ofsuccess, said Goldman. And the myth of Elvis: awesome. But thereality of Elvis: a mess.Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney,Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defamebecause he's no longer around to answer the allegations.You can't say John lack for defender. And Yoko isn't dead.Colonel Parker (Presley's manager) isn't dead. Ninety-five percentof the people in my book aren't dead. They can do something aboutit, said Goldman, his voice quickening.This business of making it easy for defending myself isinsane. I'm the target of score of attack. I can't imagine aharder thing for an author.Those attack don't really bother him, unless they come fromsomeone who hasn't read The Lives of John Lennon, Goldman said.A lot of people already made up their mind. They hear AlbertGoldman, John Lennon, homosexuality bang, let him have it! Iresent people commenting on a book they haven't read, includingYoko, the author said.Ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to thebook. She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennonstotally fiction and brought out Lennon's son, Julian and12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography.These giant promotion of Yoko are presented a honestdocumentaries, when they're in-house documentary, said Goldman,who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show. She take nochances. This wa another no-chance Yoko.As for the sensational charge of bisexuality, drug abuse byYoko and John, wild drinking binge, anorexia and reclusiveness,Goldman say it all fit together with the image of Lennonpresented by those who knew him.My thesis is John Lennon wa a divided mind. Every yin had ayang, said Goldman. There is nothing more natural than for Johnto try the other side (sexually). That's just the kind of guy hewas. He wanted to try everything once.A biography that portrays John Lennon a adrug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool toNew York City is totally fiction, Yoko Ono said in a nationalradio broadcast.It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license. I don'tsee John in there . It's a very dramatically described something,but it's not about John, Ono said Wednesday night in her firstbroadcast comment on the book by Albert Goldman.The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counterGoldman's The Lives of John Lennon, which present theex-Beatle a a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump hiswife.As for Ono, Goldman show her a a gold-digger who snortedheroin up to the time of Lennon's death. Goldman also charge shewas responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan,had affair while they were married and wa just a intent on adivorce a Lennon.Ono refuted virtually all of these charge, and counteredthrough taped interview with Lennon friend and employee thatGoldman's book wa based on unreliable source and misquotes.It's totally fiction, Yoko said during the hour-longprogram, which opened with Lennon's song, Gimme Some Truth, andcoincided with the book's national release Wednesday.These people in this book are not u. It's not John and me,Ono continued. It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hitback. . For some reason this book is attempting to rob both Johnand I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to.The Ono interview wa taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where theLennons lived and Yoko still life with their son, Sean. Lennonwas murdered by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota on Dec. 8,1980.The interview wa broadcast nationwide via the Westwood OneNetwork; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said an exact figure on how manystations picked up the broadcast wa not available.Also appearing were Sean and Lennon other son, Julian. Ono wasinterviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described inGoldman's book a a spy for Yoko a charge Mintz denied during theshow.It is, for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies,untruths . The whole thing is just sickening, said Julian, whoalso refuted Goldman's tale of Lennon a a violent father.Mintz read excerpt from the book to Yoko, who then responded tothe allegation point by point. She denied that Lennon washomosexual; that he wa using drug while living at the Dakota withhis son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll HowardHughes.She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a$5,000-a-week habit.The book ha already drawn angry response from friend ofLennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involvingLennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, ha urged a boycott ofthe book.After Yoko's rebuttal, listener were invited to dial 900-digittelephone number to vote on whether the book wa an accurateportrayal of the Lennons' life. Results were not expected untillater today.Goldman, who conducted more than 1,200 interview for his Lennonbook, ha written controversial biography of comedian Lenny Bruceand Elvis Presley.Thousands of John Lennon fan, sometoo young to remember the Beatles, swayed and sang along with songsincluding his anthem Imagine at a hometown tribute.It's a great day, isn't it? Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, askedthe crowd. I think John would be happy, too.At the close of the concert, she and son Sean, 14, wept andhugged some of the musician, who included BB. King, Joe Cocker,Roberta Flack, the Moody Blues, Hall and Oates, Wet Wet Wet andRandy Travis.However, the turnout wa only 15000, according to policeestimates. Organizers had hoped for about 45,000. Tickets were $41for the charity benefit concert, which featured a program ofBeatles and Lennon songs.The concert wa televised in Britain and wa to be rebroadcastworldwide in October in a 50th birthday tribute to Lennon a decadeafter his death.Cyndi Lauper, in a white minidress, sang Hey Bulldog, andDave Edmunds, backed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra,did the Beatles classic, A Day in the Life.Soul singer Al Green wa the opening act.

He wa crazy a well somedays but the guy would give you his heart.Lennon's co-songwriter, Paul McCartney, said on his tape:Hello Liverpool, scene of many great memory, John, me and therest of the lad.

The confessedkiller, Mark Chapman, is serving a life prison sentence.Cynthia Lennon join the throng denouncing thenew, unauthorized biography of her late former husband, JohnLennon, a written by a money-hungry author capitalizing onuntruths.People who write book like this, it is for greed, and a faras I'm concerned, they're gravedigger, no more, no le, Mrs.Lennon say on the CBS show 60 Minutes scheduled for broadcastSunday evening.Grave robber, body snatcher, you name it, they are it.The biography by Albert Goldman, The Lives of John Lennon,depicts the former Beatle a an anorexic bisexual addled by drugswho raged his way from Liverpool to New York. It wa released Sept.14.Goldman, who defends his Lennon book and said it is based on1,200 interview, also ha written controversial biography ofcomedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.Lennon wa murdered outside his Upper West Side home on Dec. 81980, by Mark David Chapman.All I know and all the people that love John know that we hadour year (and) that nobody, no film, no book will ever completewhat went on in our life. That's our part of our heart that hasto stay with u, must not be public, Mrs. Lennon said.I love John. I've always loved John because he wa my firstlove. But, I mean, I've loved him in different way. I love hismemory. I loved what he did. I understood his madness, his phases.I just feel that I understood.The couple divorced a few month before Lennon married Yoko Onoin 1969Ms. Ono already ha trashed the book, calling it totallyfiction in a nationwide broadcast that coincided with the releaseof the book. She too wa interviewed on the 60 Minutes show,entitled The Two Mrs. Lennons.These people in this book are not u.

He spent so much time with me not just athome, but everywhere, you know.Say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, ""The Lives of John Lennon"" (Morrow, $22.95), but you've got to hand it to him: This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger. Most best-selling pop biographer play it safe: They choose a celeb of respectable, not to say pristine, reputation, and then they proceed to blacken it, preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tale of sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealing, even, in some case, dyslexia. The resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public, which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it force itself to buy the biography by the million. A can't-miss formula, surely. Albert Goldman's previous victim in the genre wa Elvis Presley. Now Mr. Presley wa, if you'll forgive the expression, a fat target for a writer of Mr. Goldman's method. His title notwithstanding, the ""King of Rock 'n' Roll"" wa in truth more a creature of the old show biz, a star whose wholesome image, carefully created by PR. wizard, wa ripe for debunking. But in choosing Mr. Lennon a his next target, Mr. Goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable. For apart from his puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic in the thousand of interview he gave wa his own squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy to employee, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on. By his own accounting, then, Mr. Lennon wa not about to dethrone Ward Cleaver a the all-American dad. His public loved him in spite of it all -- or perhaps because of it all. Mr. Lennon grew to celebrity during a time when such transgression a intemperance and adultery (quaint terms!) were losing their social sting. His candor -- if that's what it wa, and not simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything. And so it is on the ground of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attack his subject. The leitmotif of Mr. Lennon's confession wa that his worst day were behind him, and that with Yoko Ono he had at last learned to prize the virtue of quietude and domesticity. Now Mr. Goldman is here to announce: He didn't tell you the half of it. Hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness, percolating with the ""scoops"" that have by now been widely publicized in People magazine, ""West 57th"" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had a thing for young boys; that his marriage to Ms. Ono wa pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit. The squalid revelation dribble out like a chemical leak, sliming up every page. Remarkably, then, the sleazemonger's art ha triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon is even worse than John Lennon's John Lennon. A great deal of this muck manages to splash onto Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portrays a a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting Mr. Lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth. Mr. Goldman, ala, allows to pas unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself a well. The keeper of the Lennon flame have of course been quick to point this out. Ms. Ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrity, they have hit the talk show to display their wound. And Rolling Stone magazine, long the house organ for the Lennon publicity machine, recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book, which wa undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic. Criticizing ""The Lives of John Lennon"" for insufficient respect to the fallen Beatle's legacy is rather off the point -- like condemning Charles Manson for his bad table manner. The book may indeed be inaccurate, a critic have charged. But one can only hope that quibble about it veracity do not obscure the countless other reason to hate Mr. Goldman's book. There is, for starter, the sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive of the grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop song a ""pieces,"" a though they were concerto. There is his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- toward drug, sex, music -- that give him license to second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. And there is the awkward organization, in which minor event assume large proportion for the simple reason that they reflect badly on Mr. Lennon, while major event are skipped over lightly because -- there go the advance! -- they might reveal Mr. Lennon in a flattering light. All of which indicates why ""The Lives of John Lennon"" is such a wretched book: not because it make a good man look bad, but because it show no other purpose than to make a man -- whether a good man or a bad one, we layman will probably never know -- look bad. John Lennon, while he wa alive, did enough of that himself to satisfy all but the lowest appetite. ---Mr. Ferguson is assistant managing editor of The American Spectator.At this point, Lennon say he became a househusband to theirchild while Yoko ran the family business. The arrangement continueduntil Lennon told the woman he called Mother it wa time tomake music again. Double Fantasy followed just before John'sdeath, although it wa not to be Lennon's swan song.Bruce Springsteen ha released three album since 1980; MichaelJackson two. In contrast, Lennon - or, more accurately, Ono - hasreleased five albums: Milk and Honey, Menlove Ave., themovie soundtrack Imagine, the John Lennon - Live in NewYork collection and a boxed CD collection for Christmas '90.In addition, The Lost Lennon Tapes, featuring hour ofunreleased Lennon music, became a popular syndicated radio program.Ono ha overseen all these projects.People ask me, `What would he have done in the '80s?' I say,`Let's talk about what he HAS done in the '80s,' because he hasdefinitely, she said. In spirit, I think he's alive, and we'regetting the benefit.Others charge Ono with turning her memory into millionswithout concern for Lennon's image. A Fame magazine profile deridedher a The Merry Widow; the now-defunct weekly 7 Days describedher a the decade's premier celebrity civil defendant.Greed, insensitivity, egomania. None of Ono's alleged fault areapparent in an interview.In October, a barefoot Ono greeted a visitor to the Dakota in ahigh-ceilinged first-floor room with white carpet and black onyxwalls. Curled up on a chair, she serenely sipped herbal tea from amug decorated with a Lennon drawing of John and Yoko with theinscription, Grow Old With Me.The mug is one of an assortment of Lennon collectible available(by appointment only) from Bag One Arts Inc., the entity thatcontrols reproduction of Lennon's art work.Some of that black on white artwork - which includes doodlesjotted down on napkin, the margin of letter or stray scrap ofpaper - ha been colorized or redone in neon at Ono's order.People would ask if we had anything in color, say LynneClifford, who run Bag One for Yoko. And Yoko said, `I feelconfident enough to add the color myself. So she took the originalsketches and we made plate and she added colors.Lithographs that sold for $400 four year ago have increased asmuch a 10 time in value, she say, and new one cost between $600and $700.Although Bag One's gallery a few block from the Dakota dealsprimarily in lithograph, it also sell the collectible, including$3 laminated bag that bear Lennon's drawings.Yoko wanted everybody to be able to walk away withsomething, explained Clifford.Where doe all the money go?Yoko is very funny about (saying) where the money go. ...But some go to the Spirit Foundation, she said. The foundation,established by Lennon and Ono before John's death, ha contributedto cause ranging from a home for drug addicted child tobulletproof vest for police officers.Is there anything that will never bear Lennon's sketch-work?Socks, Clifford said. Yoko said she couldn't imagine peoplewalking around on John's drawings.Back at the Dakota, Ono receives a familiar question: Is thisall commercialism? Has the iconoclastic ex-Beatle been sold out?She laughsNo. I didn't sell out John. And I'm sure John would be happyI'm still keeping him out there. . There's a commercial aspectyes, but I mean, why not? I wa a partner, and I still feel thatI'm a partner.Dozens of fan of rock legend andformer Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturdayfor a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.Liverpool's mayor, Dorothy Gavin, led Lennon devotee who laidwreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of The Beatles in the city'sCavern Walks shopping center.The center wa built on the original site of the Cavern Club,made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and hasbecome a place of pilgrimage.Give peace a chance, the title of one of singer-songwriterLennon's greatest hit, wa the theme for the day.Many friend and follower of Lennon were present, includingFather Tom McKenzie, immortalized a Father MacKenzie in TheBeatles' l966 hit song Eleanor Rigby.On Friday, a small group of invited guest had gathered atLiverpool's Beatles Museum to watch Mrs. Gavin unveil a plaquemarking the 10th anniversary of Lennon's death.John wa always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 yearsLiverpool ha been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatlescame from Liverpool, said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after theunveiling.It is right that a world figure like Lennon should berecognized at last, said Coleman, author of John Lennon.Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartmentin New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording sessionon Dec. 8, 1980, when Lennon wa shot to death by Mark DavidChapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph onlyhours before. Lennon wa 40.A spokesman for the Lennon family said Ms. Ono and the couple'sson, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversaryprivately.Journalist Andy Peebles, the last person to interview Lennonbefore he wa shot, said in an interview with Sky satellitetelevision news:Ten year on, it's a ghastly feeling to thinkthat you had spent . seven hour . with somebody you have beena fan of for year, and I think I left . thinking `This is great,he's in really good shape.'Peebles said late in 1980 that Lennon had just recovered from aperiod when he had gone off the rail and his relationship withMs. Ono had suffered. But (when I saw him) they'd had the baby,Sean had been born, and everything wa great.John Lennon spent much of a three-year spantucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus positionwith his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according toa biography of the slain Beatle.An excerpt from the book, The Lives of John Lennon byjournalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflatteringportrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.The book is scheduled to be published later this month byWilliam Morrow & Co. Inc.Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon could not bemore remote.Apart from a few hour in the morning and evening, includingtime spent with his son, Sean, Lennon is back here in his room,alone and silent.The author say the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult lifeas an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived asperfection. The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965,Goldman writes, when some fool described him in print a the `fatBeatle.' That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that thewound ha never healed.Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backlessslippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.The 719-page biography also detail Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-weekheroin habit in 1979. She reportedly snorted the drug.According to the book, Lennon also took heroin and consumed agreat deal of LSD.I must have taken a thousand trip, the book quote Lennonas saying. I just ate it all the time like candy.Goldman spent more than six year researching the book,interviewing 1,200 friend, relative and associate of Lennon, whowas murdered eight year ago in New York.Drummer Andy Newmark wa touring with Roxy Musicin the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life:He wa to play on John Lennon's new album.Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five year, busy takingcare of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting idea. Butin 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return tothe studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.It wa more than a superstar session. Afterall, Lennon gave nopress conference, and didn't attend club or concert. Rare photosoccasionally emerged and he looked different in each one (Lennonjokingly referred to himself a Greta Hughes and HowardGarbo).Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon a anengineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist HughMcCracken and other New York-based session player. Recording wasto take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.To Newmark, Lennon wa a hero and only a hero. He didn't knowhim and wa nervous about working with him. The drummer guessed hewas something like the intense, irreverent young man of the moviesHelp! and A Hard Day's Night. Lennon wa those thing - andmore.His personality seemed so consistent with all we had everheard about John Lennon, said Newmark, who still life in NewYork and work with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.His straightforwardness wa a visible and apparant a thestories and image we had created.

24,d097e,"While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph windroared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it ventedon his beloved, 300-year-old city.Riley, city official and a few reporter stayed in Charleston'shistoric City Hall through Thursday night a the area's worsthurricane in three decade pounded the coastal city where the CivilWar began.Late in the day, there wa hope Hugo might spare Charleston. Butthe storm gathered strength and speed a it spun straight towardthis city, which had survived a number of near miss from greatstorms in recent years.From the moment it became apparent Hugo might strike theSoutheast coast, many Charlestonians conceded that, this time, theirnumber wa up.As Hugo's wind howled outside the plywood board protecting thewindows, reporter wandered in and out of Riley's office. On hisdesk several candle burned a insurance against the inevitable lossof power.Later there wa a sharp crack a a piece of the tin roof rippedoff and water seeped down on the burnished wood table in the CityCouncil chamber. Phone and electric service to the city command postwas knocked out.During it all, Riley kept in close contact with the NationalWeather Service. As the eye of the storm passed, he took reportersonto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at thedamage.The initial view, sketched out in the glow of flashlight, wasunsettling: The tin roof wa tossed in the gutter, slate tile werescattered on the ground. Bricks, stick and leaf littered thestreet.This is the eye of the hurricane. I've never been in one and Ihope I'm never in one again, Riley said. It's scarcely a latesummer breeze.As the storm died before dawn, Riley wa out on the street againin a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment ofthe damage.Serious but fixable, the mayor concluded.Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurer. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net loss related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG ha told them that it must cover the first $35 million of loss and that it reinsurance agreement will cover the bulk of the remaining damage. AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal region of the Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount take into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under it reinsurance contract, the company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on it earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimate that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cent and 65 cent a share on an after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said it State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimate claim payment from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster. When damage in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payment will exceed $500 million. It said that is more than three time the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.Supercomputers, satellite and the expertise ofseveral hurricane forecaster predicted the destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to fleethe South Carolina coast.But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.All the world's knowledge about meteorological condition andforecasting change in those condition is embodied in thosemodels, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall wa difficult, butforecasters said Friday that the landfall wa predicted in time forevacuation.Overall, I think the tracking model gave u a very good ideawhere Hugo would be so official in South Carolina could act in atimely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem with Hugo wa predicting theintensity of the storm, which wa upgraded to a Category 4 hurricanejust hour before it slammed into Charleston.It is very difficult to predict change in intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer model for that, McAdie said.We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.The hurricane specialist were surprised by the last-minuteincrease in wind speed, which wa reported to them by Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who ha tracked hurricane for 35years, said that a couple of decade ago, the only forecasting toolswere report from aircraft or ships.We had no radar or satellite then, so needle to say ourforecasts were le accurate, Clark said.In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellite toobtain a global weather picture. Information from the satellite isused to improve the accuracy of the large-scale model thattelevision viewer see every night.Using the information from the satellite, supercomputer at theNational Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where a tracking model constantly change toaccount for current weather condition and the position of thehurricane.To determine the track of the storm, the forecaster analyzesupercomputer prediction, satellite data, the history of similarstorms and the current path of the hurricane.Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the MassachussettsInstitute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.Congress and the American people are suffering from thecollective delusion that our data problem have been solved bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enoughinformation about the wind and temperature that affect ahurricane's path.Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanescomes from flying airplane into the hurricane, and they do a verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite picture is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have to remember that those model used are only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of theforecaster to predict the storm's path.Residents took forecaster at their wordwhen they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number ofdeaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthyrespect, authority said.The storm, which caused billion in damage, claimed 17 life inSouth Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, whichbore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.We just feel very thankful about that, said Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousand of people who were in the sheltersand the ten of thousand of people who evacuated inland werepotential victim of injury and death.Riley and other official credited resident with monitoring thehurricane a it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuationwarnings.The last big storm to hit South Carolina wa Hurricane David in1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.Since then several big storm have threatened but veered away,and official were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've had so many close call, said Gary Garnet, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service.But this storm wa very, very strong, he said. This timethey realized it.Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000residents in Charleston and the three surrounding county headedfor shelters.Tens of thousand more got into their car and headed upInterstate 26 toward Columbia.Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related death, credited people for heeding thewarnings.It wa bad, but it could have been a lot worse, he said.You've just got to say nice thing about the people.Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-wearyCharlestonians: late Saturday the tropic were quiet with no otherstorms brewing.There's nothing to worry about out there, he said.Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday after thousand of coastal resident insoutheastern state grabbed what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.This is a disaster staring u right in the eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston,where the hurricane downed power line, snapped tree and causedutility transformer to explode.All we can do now is pray and hope all the precaution we havetaken have been sufficient, Riley said a Hugo's eye bore in onthe city. I just hope and pray we can get through this without anyloss of life.By midnight, 119 mph wind were reported in Charleston. The roofcracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that haswithstood several hurricane, and torrent of water poured into thepaneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the commandpost wa knocked out.Hurricane-force wind first hit the coast by 9:15 pm. EDT, andabout three hour later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle ofPalms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of theNational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.The eye wa about 10 mile across and top wind were still at 135mph.Hugo wa expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severeflooding a it moved up the East Coast. The storm posed a 19 percentchance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hittingBoston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.As Hugo neared the coast, road from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,200 mile north, were nearly empty, a were the boarded-up resorttowns themselves. Power line and tree were downed in some spotsand water flooded road. Stop light and neon light were knockedout in Myrtle Beach.One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,' said AmyGarrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.In Charleston, the hurricane littered street with tin roofs,palmetto frond and chunk of bark. Businesses were closed andclasses at public school and university canceled. Riley orderedresidents of one-story home to evacuate.Hospitals stockpiled supply, discharging any patient wellenough to go and moving others to hospital inland to make room foremergency patient, official said.About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelter across the stateas of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220miles northwest of here.We tried to close the door but people are sneaking in sidedoors, said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at theConway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach. We tried to postguards at the door, but people were still coming in.American Red Cross relief effort were buckling under the numberof evacuee, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., whoappealed for help.Right now the Red Cross is sheltering ten of thousand ofpeople all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course is at the sametime that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and theother Caribbean islands.We're beginning to feel the squeeze. Our resource are verytight. Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest reliefoperations of the decade.At midnight, the center of Hugo wa near latitude 32.7 degreesnorth and longitude 79.9 degree west, forecaster said. Thehurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.Near it center, Hugo's muscle reached wind of 135 mph, up from125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North andSouth Carolina can expect tornado linked to Hugo for the next twodays, according to the hurricane center.The coastal area could expect hurricane force wind for 10 to 12hours once the eye come ashore, official said. A hurricane warningwas in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.By late afternoon, Hugo wa upgraded to a category 4 hurricane onthe Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,which indicated it could cause extreme damage.It strengthened more than we thought it would, Sheets said,adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding a it moved up theAppalachians.The timing of the landfall wa critical because of the storm'stidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 foot high that would feed anormal 5-foot high tide that peak after 2 a.m.On top of that will be wave, Sheets said earlier, and inmany place on barrier island the building will be swept cleanoff.It's taken the devastation caused byHurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debtbetween two city almost 1,000 mile apart.As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston israising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.After Kingston, then New York's capital, wa burned in October1777 by the British, New York Gov. George Clinton received a letterfrom South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston. The letter includednearly 1,000 New York pound to help Kingston resident get throughtheir crisis.This money ha been received for the charitable purpose ofalleviating the distress of the now-indigent inhabitant of thetown of Kingston, who by the ravage of the enemy are reduced topoverty and want, Livingston wrote on March 31, 1778.Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter whenHurricane Hugo ravaged the Carolinas last week. I figured theyhelped u, we should do something for them, Ford said.On Wednesday, a local Red Cross chapter began collectingdonations for victim of the hurricane.A lot of people have been calling, asking to send donationsdown there, said Susan Lawlor, executive director of the UlsterCounty Chapter of the Red Cross.On Tuesday, New York state sent two airplane full of food,clothing and water to part of the Caribbean ravaged by Hugo. A NewYork National Guard C-5A cargo plane also left Tuesday to pick upequipment in Mississippi and take it to Puerto Rico.Another cargo plane wa scheduled to leave Stewart Air ForceBase in Newburgh, taking 70 ton of food, water and other suppliesto Puerto Rico.This historic city ha survived theravages of earthquake, battle and storm in it storied300-year-history, but it faced perhaps it greatest test of all inHurricane Hugo.The storm, packing wind of up to 135 mph, raged into CharlestonThursday night.This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the like of which fewpeople who have lived all their life in Charleston haveexperienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.Hugo wa the first major hurricane to strike Charleston sinceHurricane Gracie came ashore 70 mile to the south in 1959.The seaside community ha suffered through many disaster, bothnatural and man-made.The worst in recent decade wa in 1938 when a tornado torethrough the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundred and causingan estimated $2 million in property damage.Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structure liningquaint street and alleyway, is where the Civil War began in 1861.The city ha survived the shot and shell of two war and anynumber of smaller hurricane, politely referred to by Charlestoniansof refinement a September gales.But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on thehot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what somefolks thought wa a prelude to Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake wa felt a far away a Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, theearthquake claimed an estimated 110 life, destroyed 102 buildingsand tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimney into the streets.In recent year, the city ha attracted million of visitorsannually who tour it historic building and visit it nearby finesand beaches.Charleston ha received international acclaim a home to SpoletoFestival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike to refer to Spoleto a the world's most comprehensive artsfestival.Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record book a the costliest storm insurer have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rate to rise immediately, analyst and company official say. The property claim service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, is expected to announce it estimate of total insured loss tomorrow. ""Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record,"" said one official, far surpassing the $752.5 million insurer paid out after Frederick ripped through several Gulf Coast state in 1979. The impact on premium rate could be minimal for now, analyst expect, because the biggest loss will be in the personal insurance area -- for home and auto. Most company typically set aside fund from premium they collect every year to cover claim they might have to pay in the future. In the last three year, hurricane and storm season have been relatively mild, so insurer haven't had to dip into these fund. And since Hugo also stormed through the Caribbean, foreign insurer are at risk for some of the damage on those island. Yet, some analyst believe Hugo's huge loss will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurer le likely to slash premium rate further in coming month. Rates have been falling since late 1986. Udayan Ghose at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. belief these reason might cause rate to edge higher by mid-1990. For the time being, the loss from Hugo ""will be substantial, but they won't be something the industry can't handle,"" said Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James & Co., a New York-based insurance broker. For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimate it will pay claim totaling more than $400 million to homeowner and for some small business. Nationwide Insurance Co., a mutual company based in Columbus, Ohio, said Hugo ""is the single largest claim disaster"" it ha seen in it 63-year history. The company, which is the largest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and No. 3 in South Carolina, ha already received 16,000 claim from the stricken region. Claims could total $100 million, a spokesman said. For some insurer, Hugo wa a double-whammy. New York-based Continental Corp., which is a big insurer in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, said it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter, reflecting it net exposure to the damage caused by the hurricane. ""Hugo will be particularly costly to us,"" said John P. Mascotte, Continental's chairman. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which ha extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operation in the area Hugo hit, and USF&G Corp. in Baltimore, a big insurer in the Carolina region, could also be forced to take one-time charge against third-quarter earnings, analyst said. Some of USF&G's loss hit very close home -- it Charleston office wa destroyed by the hurricane. Both USF&G and Cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge; USF&G said it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of loss, and it reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional loss. Hugo could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at Travelers Corp., Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., according to industry analyst. Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James belief that even if loss from Hugo total a much a $5 billion, insurer won't feel enough ""financial pain, such a not being able to pay shareholder dividends,"" to compel them to boost premium rate right away. He explained that in the first six month of this year, net income for the industry declined slightly from 1988, but insurance company were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity. He also noted that the industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently at $125 billion, is also plentiful. Generally, insurer can book about $3 of premium for every $1 of surplus. Right now, premium total about $200 billion, he said. An official at Nationwide Insurance noted that the company ha $1 of surplus for every $2 of insurance that it writes. Insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the loss. Michael Lewis at Dean Witter Reynolds said loss from Hugo could be big enough to ""temporarily"" increase reinsurance rate. Although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some company, the loss they must still cover could hurt third-quarter result. Niagara Exchange Corp., based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report a loss from operation for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial loss that it Charleston Insurance Co. unit face a a result of the hurricane. State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance. It belief it reserve are plentiful enough to absorb it loss, a spokesman said.

Jim Boling.Divers worked where the two creek empty into the Ohio.Four body were found Sunday. But two of those were notimmediately identified, and the list of missing wa not revised toaccount for them.The number missing dropped to 16 with the other two body andthe removal of two other names: a woman who called to say she wassafe and a person who authority weren't sure lived in the area,said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.The 20th victim wa pulled from the mouth of Pipe Creek at theOhio River, about seven mile south of Shadyside, Vogt said.Another body wa found in debris along Wegee Creek, and two bodieswere found earlier in the Ohio, he said.That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's flood to20, including five children.Twenty-three dog team from four state were searching forvictims, said Boling. The digging will continue at least throughTuesday, said Fire Chief Mark Badia.The thing you find once you start into these brush pile andpiles of tree are car, and they have to be torn apart andsearched separately, Badia said. Everything you turn up createsa different situation.But Vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be foundalive.It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody aliveout there, he said. You can't swim out there that long in theOhio River.The Wegee and Pipe creek overflowed Thursday night duringstorms that poured 5{ inch of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3{ hours.The flood destroyed a many a 70 house and damaged up to 40others.Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some ofthose were later found dead, while others notified authority thatthey were safe.Officials also learned that some of those feared missing hadmoved out of the area. Officials were comparing county propertylists and data from the Census Bureau with information fromresidents and relative, Boling said.Investigators Sunday blamed the flash flood on an unusuallyheavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacity ofthreebridges over the creek. Badia said rainwater running downhillsides forced debris into the creek, forming dam at eachbridge. The dam broke under the water pressure.Eventually the bridge couldn't hold any more. The debrisbroke loose, and that's when we got three big gush of water, hesaid.As rescue effort continued, the National Guard cleared roadsand bridge leading into the stricken area.Eighteen Ohio county have been declared federal disaster areassince tornado and flooding first struck May 25.Across the border in West Virginia, Gov.

You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River,said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.The search for the missing wa suspended briefly this morningwhen a thunderstorm rolled through the area. Heavy rain fell forabout 45 minute, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creek thatoverflowed in Thursday night's flash flood.By midmorning, the muddy creek wa nearly crossing a road aboutthree mile upstream from where the flood inflicted the mostdamage.

Authorities are not rulingout the possibility that other people not on the list could bemissing.Four body were recovered Sunday.Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of thoselater were found dead, while others notified authority that theywere safe and official learned that still more had moved out ofthe area.Wegee and Pipe creek overflowed during storm that dumped 5{inches of rain in 3{ hour. The flood destroyed a many a 70houses and damaged up to 40 others.Most of those whose home and belonging were swept away by thewall of water will have to put their life back together largelywithout benefit of insurance.Few people in the coal-mining and steel-making area carriedflood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damagefrom Thursday's flood, resident and insurer said.We didn't think we needed to have flood insurance. For what?That creek never flooded. Then this. Everybody just got wipedout, said Julia Kulazenka.Rainwater running down hillside had forced debris into thecreeks and formed dam at bridge spanning them, Shadyside FireChief Mark Badia said.Eventually the bridge couldn't hold any more. The debrisbroke loose, and that's when we got three big gush of water,Badia said.The home Mrs. Kulazenka shared with her husband until his deathlast July wa damaged a Wegee Creek raged out of control. She saidreplacing a machine shop, garage, deck and automobile she and herson owned would cost more than $80,000.They told u homeowners' won't do u no good. So unless thegovernment help u rebuild, I don't know what I'll do with thisplace, Mrs. Kulazenka said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open anoffice Tuesday in Shadyside to accept application from residentsfor low-interest loan and grant to help them rebuild.Before the flood, land in the Wegee Creek valley fetchedhandsome price, said Kulazenka's son, Charles Kulazenka. That wasespecially welcome to resident, many of whom were either retiredor laid off from job in coal mine in Belmont County, whereunemployment in April wa 6.8 percent.Ground wa at a premium down here before this because it wasjust outside the city limit (of Shadyside). It wa quiet andpeaceful and people were looking to buy and build new home outhere. Now, you couldn't give it away, Kulazenka said.But we can't be bitter, though, because we've got our lives,and a lot of our neighbor, real close buddy, weren't thatlucky.

27,d098e,"Already they're saying it's thebiggest happening in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to atelescope.So, step right up folk, and discover the wonder of theuniverse. See how big it is. Learn it age. Look at light created14 billion year ago and arriving at your eye only this instant.Ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the BigBang of 10 or 20 thousand million year ago. See star born and seethem die. Watch galaxy form. Follow the flow of gas into theMilky Way's halo. Peer deep into the universe, past so many starsin our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetimeto count, to a hundred billion other galaxy each with about 200billion stars.For scientist, and then the rest of u, all that becomespossible now that the space shuttle Discovery ha carried theHubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one ha seenbefore. The telescope, a silvery tube a long a a tanker truck,has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light.Light, speeding along at 186,000 mile a second, is themessenger of creation. Tracking the trail of light from today tothe first moment contains all the information we will ever haveabout the creation of the universe.The Hubble promise to give science an open window perhaps tothe first echo of creation. This is a world-class event, even ifastronomy is not your thing.Superlatives?In the history of optical astronomy there have been two greatleaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in theautumn of 1609, and the Hubble Space Telescope in April 1990. Eric J. Chaisson, a senior scientist at the Space Telescope ScienceInstitute in Baltimore.One more?No one ever made anything that good, James Westphal,California Institute of TechnologyAnother?Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that theHubble telescope will literally be the dawn of a new era inastronomy.Eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance. But the HST, namedafter Edwin Powell Hubble, hold that kind of promise.Hubble wa an astronomer in the first half of the century whoconcluded not only that distant galaxy are moving away from Earthbut that the farther away they are, the faster they move. Thetheory of an expanding universe supported the belief that theuniverse originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter isstill rushing from the site of that so-called Big Bang.Astronomers think the Big Bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billionyears ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incrediblespeed and heat. Eventually matter cooled and condensed intogalaxies, star and planets.There are bigger telescope than the Hubble, but they are all onEarth and all subject to a major limitation the atmosphere which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through. Theproblem of skywatching through layer of air ha been likened tobirdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool.The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing view ofEarth's sister planet, had to travel 12 year to get close enoughfor picture a they whizzed past. With the Hubble, say scientistEdward Weiler, such picture are possible any time we want.The telescope is 42.5 by 14 foot and consists of a 94.5-inchprimary mirror that gather incoming light.On a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two milesaway, say Weiler, chief NASA scientist on the Hubble project.With a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000miles away. With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia fromWashington.Ground controller at the GoddardSpace Flight Center finally made contact today with the two mainantennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after tryingfor more than six hour to lock on.Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md.,as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space wassolved.We have confirmation that we have achieved communication withthe Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antennasystem, said NASA's Dave Drachlis.Engineers had said all along they believed the antenna wereworking all right and that the problem wa in incorrectly pointingeither the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communicationssatellite that act a a switchboard.In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of theantennas' beam to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2degrees to 10.8 degrees.The telescope's low-gain antenna, which receive and transmitinformation at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies,were working well.Space shuttle Discovery wa 46 mile away, available to remedycertain problem. The outage wa not a problem for which spacewalker would have been summoned.The five astronaut were otherwise busy making picture ofstorms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doingexperiments.Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspect ofthe telescope, said the first outage wa caused by human error andwas not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 am. EDT andlasted 45 minute to an hour, he said.The second failure occurred at 6:44 am. when controllersattempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gainantennas through the TDRS.This time it wa a pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, aGoddard spokesman. It's a new spacecraft and we thinkinexperience dealing with it wa the cause.The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new world, wasreleased from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minutesnag that almost sent two astronaut on an emergency spacewalk.Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loudrendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite.Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after thatsong, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are alot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday andHubble had a good night while you were asleep.We appreciate the good word from everybody, repliedDiscovery Commander Loren Shriver.After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discoveryaway from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series ofmaneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to parkDiscovery in orbit 46 mile behind Hubble.The telescope really looked great a we flew away from it, andwe sure hope it doe good work, Shriver said Wednesday.Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great workyou've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud ofyou.Scientists have hailed the Hubble NASA's most expensiveunmanned spacecraft a the greatest advance in astronomy sinceGalileo raised a small telescope to his eye nearly 400 year ago.Discovery and it five astronaut will follow the telescopewhile controller at the Goddard center make sure Hubble isoperating properly, such a responding to directional commands.The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-footaperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished94.5-inch mirror to starlight.Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image fromthe telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.Data will follow in a month or two.If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery couldreturn to the telescope so two astronaut could perform a spacewalkto fix it.Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would betested today for it ability to maneuver before the aperture dooris opened.We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger theHubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, hesaid. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitiveinstruments.On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoistit from the cargo bay.One of the telescope's solar array unreeled from it mast asexpected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries,which otherwise had only eight hour of charge.But there wa trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budgewhen the latch were released, and then moved about a fifth of its39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way outon the third attempt.By the final attempt, astronaut Bruce McCandless and KathrynSullivan were in their space suit in the airlock, 30 minute awayfrom taking tool in hand and going on an outer-space maintenancecall.Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.The 8{-hour procedure wa performed 380 mile above Earth, 70miles higher than any shuttle ha ever flown. The orbit wasdictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distortingatmosphere.Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost thebeginning of the time, studying star and galaxy so distant theirlight ha taken 14 billion year to reach Earth. They hope todetermine how and when the universe wa formed, currently estimatedat 15 billion year ago.The telescope originally wa scheduled for launch in 1983 butwas delayed by technical problem and the Challenger accident.Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled toland Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.Five astronaut boarded Discoverytoday for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope intoorbit to scan the outermost reach of the universe for clue tothe beginning of time.Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation ofwhat the Hubble will be able to accomplish, said Lennard Fisk,head of NASA science activities.Air Force forecaster said there wa a 90 percent chance theweather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at thescheduled time of 8:31 am. EDT.More than a half million gallon of liquid hydrogen and liquidoxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tank after midnight.The astronaut, wearing bright orange flight suit, climbed intothe crew cabin just a dawn wa breaking over the Kennedy SpaceCenter.The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will giveastronomers a new set of eye and ear that we don't have, saidWilliam Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't saywhat we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learnmany new things.Discovery wa aiming for an altitude of 380 mile, the highest ashuttle ha ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in it properorbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35thshuttle mission.Columbia, which journey into space next month with the Astroobservatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 mile from Discovery, only thesecond time both pad have been occupied; the first wa in 1986just before the Challenger explosion.Hubble ha been waiting to take it place in space since 1983,delayed by technical problem and the Challenger accident. Thelatest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch wasscrubbed four minute before liftoff because of a faulty power uniton the shuttle.The mood at the Kennedy Space Center wa considerably lessfestive than during the first launch attempt, when hundred ofastronomers gathered with their families.The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley willuse the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescopeinto space. Veteran spacewalker Bruce McCandless II and KathrynSullivan will assist if a problem develops.Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 mile away for two daysuntil after it lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished94.5-inch mirror to starlight.Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data bysatellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said itwill release it first image an open star cluster in theconstellation Carina a week after launch.In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million hasbeen spent on spare part, astronaut training and computer softwareto operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed$250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.NASA estimate it will cost $200 million a year to operate andmaintain the telescope in space.During it 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provideastronomers with 10 time better resolution and 25 time moresensitivity than ground-based observatory. As a result, they willbe able to study star and galaxy so distant their light ha beentraveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe wa created 15billion year ago a believed and uncover some of the mysterysurrounding galaxy, black hole and quasar. Hubble also isexpected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. Hiswork gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe wa createdby a tremendous explosion.In addition to Hubble, Discovery carry a human skull filledwith sensor to measure the space radiation that astronautsreceive. It is the skull's third trip into space.The shuttle is to end it five-day mission with a landing atEdwards Air Force Base, Calif.Seven year late, the Hubble SpaceTelescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search ofothers so distant that they may have been formed at the beginningof time.Less than five hour after it rode into space aboard the shuttleDiscovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent it firsttest radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheer eruptedin Mission Control in Houston.As near a we can tell, everything look perfect, saidastronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesdaywill be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant bluesky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 milesabove Earth higher by 70 mile than any previous shuttle. Therethe Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonder of creationwith instrument that can look 14 billion year backward in time.Our window on the universe! NASA launch commentator GeorgeDiller exulted a the Discovery rose off it seaside launch pad.It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbitinstead of here on Earth like it's been for so many year, saidNASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's in it element and I'mdelighted.The telescope wa supposed to be launched in 1983, but technicalproblems and the Challenger accident delayed it deployment. Itsuffered a further delay two week ago when the countdown wasstopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faultyhydraulic unit on the shuttle.While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million amonth to exercise and keep in readiness. In it first day in space,that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of theGoddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.On hand to watch the Discovery launching wa a contingent ofscientists who have hailed the Hubble a the greatest advance inastronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eye nearly400 year ago.Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he wa askedabout the long delay in getting the telescope to it workingstation.Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day thatGalileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?' saidTruly, a former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day welaunch Hubble, it matter that we do it right.The telescope is 43 foot long and 14 foot in diameter, about thesize of a railroad tank car. When it fly free, it will receiveelectrical power for it six scientific instrument from twowing-like solar array that extend outward on each side.It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whotheorized that the universe wa expanding and that the farther awaya galaxy is, the faster it is traveling. That gave support to thetheory that a massive explosion the Big Bang created theuniverse 10 to 20 billion year ago.The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two majorquestions: How old is the universe? How big is it?The telescope ha two mirror, one 94.5 inch in diameter, theother 12 inch. Two of the instrument are camera, two arespectrometers and one is a photometer. In addition, the finepointing system act a a sixth instrument by providing precisemeasurement of distances.On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope withthe shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, pointit, and after a long checkout drop it overboard to orbit on itsown.In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power fromthe shuttle. But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted outand it will depend on internal battery until the solar panel areextended to receive light from the sun.Should the solar panel not deploy, mission specialist BruceMcCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partiallydressed in space suit, ready to go into the open cargo bay tounfurl the array manually.Discovery's launch wa not without it problems.With 31 second left in the countdown, the computer that runsthe final moment before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve andstopped the launch process. The problem wa overcome and theshuttle lifted off at 8:34 am. EDT, about three minute late.The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 am. EDT atEdwards Air Force Base in California.On the way uphill, a Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, theshuttle's windshield wa splattered with several fleck ofthings. He said the windshield wa streaked by the debris andthat it also wa smeared when the spent booster rocket fell offduring the climb to orbit.The astronaut also had problem with their UHF radio circuit,and one of the ship's small rear thruster wa inoperative. Neitherproblem wa considered serious.Discovery's astronaut overcamebalky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating freefrom the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secret of theuniverse.The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3minutes at an altitude of 380 mile high above the atmosphere,which ha limited the view of ground-based telecopes.Discovery, go for Hubble release, Mission Control told thecrew at 3:37 pm. EDT. The event occurred a minute later a theshuttle slowly and carefully backed away.The final hour before it release were a nightmare for groundcontrollers a they commanded the unfurling of two solar panelsthat power the telescope's instruments.The starboard panel balked twice a it wa being pulled from itsreel. Mission Control ordered space-walking astronaut to be readyto go out of the cabin to help. But there wa a third try and itwas successful.We have confirmation that the solar array wing on thestarboard side ha been deployed, the telescope control center inMaryland said.So we have good news, said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubblecontrol center.The deployment of the two 39-foot panel allowed sun power toflow into the telescope's battery, relieving worry that theywould use up their eight-hour charge.Before astronaut Steve Hawley wa able to lift the 12{-tontelescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, itsinstruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power andshifted over to the batteries.Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B atKennedy Space Center, the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly onits own, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The game hasbegun. The race is on. The clock is ticking.Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put onspacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walkoutside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of thesolar panel failed.Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at theend of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from it silver surfaceand a turning Earth in the background.Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shrivermaneuvered the shuttle into it deployment position, with it nosepointed toward the sun. That wa to put the telescope's solararrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly startcollecting energy and protect the telescope's fixed star trackerswhile the instrument wa being held above the payload bay.Discovery is in orbit 380 mile above Earth, 70 mile higherthan any previous shuttle. The orbit wa dictated by the need toput the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.For those technically inclined this morning, I'd like to passon the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer (Hawley),something to the effect that the big marble sure look far awaytoday, Shriver said.The five astronauts' busy day began on a musical note early thismorning a Mission Control played a song called Space is OurWorld, written by member of Discovery's training team and aHouston-area group, Private Numbers.Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space FlightCenter in Maryland said Tuesday that no problem had been detectedso far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmannedspacecraft ever built.Everything ha just being going like clockwork, said RonSchlagheck, shift director of orbital verification at Goddard.Everybody is in excellent spirits.The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problem and the 1986Challenger accident, ha waited seven year to take it place inspace. It finally got a ride into orbit Tuesday morning aboardDiscovery.Hubble will allow astronomer to study star and galaxy sodistant their light ha taken 14 billion year to reach Earth. Itis expected to provide clue to the age and size of the universe,and it may solve the mystery of quasar, pulsar and black holesand even find star with planet that could conceivably supportlife.The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 foot long and 14 foot indiameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it is inorbit, it will receive electrical power for it six scientificinstruments from two winglike solar arrays.It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whosediscovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave riseto the Big Bang theory that the universe wa created by atremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion year ago.The Hubble Space Telescope wasawakened from it self-induced sleep today but it wa still withoutthe use of it high-speed antenna, and it science instrumentswere on hold, unable to begin any observations.We are out of the `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, asupervisor of the engineer controlling the telescope. He said thetelescope wa running on a normal control-all mode, where itsown computer and sensor guide where it is pointing.Discovery's astronaut, meanwhile, packed their gear for areturn to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observation of Earthand talked with ground-based reporter about their flight.Pilot Charles Bolden said he wa especially upbeat about thewidespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expectedeventually to look back 14 billion light year nearly to thebirth of the universe.It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who ha never heardof the Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It make littlekids' eye light up. It make little kid want to learn how to addand subtract and study science.The telescope's big eye ha remained open, but Hubble had beenin a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlierproblems in linking the high-speed dish antenna with a relaysatellite. The antenna are the primary link for relayingscientific data to the ground.Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recordersin the telescope read telemetry signal from all it system andthat these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennasare working properly.We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, hesaid. Engineers are able to send command to the telescope via itssecondary antenna but the communication system is not useful forscientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.We're putting the scientific instrument in a hold mode, ineffect a standby mode, he said.Shortly after 6 am. EDT, controller at the Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commandsthat took the telescope out of it safe mode and then began to runa 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope isoperating the way it wa supposed to at this point in the startupprocess, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and carefulapproach to these problem, Olivier said Friday. This is notthe time to do anything dumb.The telescope problem have put the flight center several daysbehind, but the five astronaut who deployed it earlier this weekwere sticking to their schedule.Landing is scheduled for 9:48 am. EDT Sunday at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif., but flight controller were keeping a closewatch on the weather.Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gust up to 29 mph.Mission rule dictate that headwind cannot exceed 29 mph attouchdown.The shuttle carry enough supply to stay in orbit three daysbeyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.Mission Control awakened the crew member at about 1:30 am. EDTtoday by playing the song, Cosmos.Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate fortoday, said Commander Loren Shriver.The song wa selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope,which is now open for business, said Mission Control commentatorJames Hartsfield.The astronaut were to finish up their experiment andphotography today and pack for the trip home. They also planned tohold a news conference from space with reporter at the JohnsonSpace Center.Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series oftests to make certain the shuttle's computer and control jet wereready for return to Earth.The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed closeto the telescope in case there wa trouble opening the aperturedoor. Mission specialist Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivanwere prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open inorbit 380 mile above Earth.But that proved unnecessary when the door wa opened Fridaymorning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye tostarlight for the first time.Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscope stoppedworking when the door opened, but engineer later got them back online. The gyroscope were knocked out by the motion and that, too,kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, directorof orbital verification at Goddard.A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's system were set atconservative limit for the first operation and that caused manymalfunctions. There also were two communication outage totalingseveral hours.Hubble is designed with safe mode so it can be the master ofits own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communicationssystem is lost for extended period, Terry said.NASA had planned to release it first test image from thetelescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in theconstellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed becauseof the antenna problem. Scientific data will follow in a month ortwo.The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,will enable astronomer over it 15-year working lifetime to lookback 14 billion year and possibly determine the age of theuniverse.The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billionyears ago in a cosmic explosion.Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding andthat the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is movingaway.The Hubble Space Telescope orbitedwith it big eye open Friday after ground controller overcamecommunications problem and lifted it lens cover, but itselectronics were shut down due to a malfunction.Those problem, however, were not the immediate concern ofshuttle Discovery's astronaut, who prepared for Sunday's return toEarth.You've been released from Hubble support. It's on it own,Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members.That's great news, replied Discovery commander Loren J.Shriver.There are handshake and smile all around up here. I'll betit's just that way back down there, too, added mission specialistSteven Hawley. Who's buying tonight?We'll buy when you all get back, Musgrave replied.Flight director William Reeves said it wa too early to cheer.`We still have an important part of the mission to go, Reevessaid. We reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on theground.Discovery is to land at 9:48 am. EDT Sunday at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif. Landing would have been delayed a day ifastronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to performa space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperturedoor.The shuttle trailed 50 mile behind Hubble when the aperturedoor opened 380 mile above Earth, but passed 3.7 mile beneath thetelescope later in the day.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned torelease it first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope onTuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.But Steve Terry, director of orbital verification, said that wouldbe delayed by problem with Hubble's high-speed antennas.Scientific data will follow in a month or two.Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door wa opened to theheavens at 10:30 am. EDT, nearly four hour later than planned,exposing it finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for thefirst time.Ground controller sent a signal commanding the door to lifteven though the telescope wa in an automatic safe mode, withall motion stopped because of problem in linking it high-speeddish antenna with a relay satellite.One of the two antenna apparently had swung too far, and thetelescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, a Hubble deputy projectmanager. If future movement of the antenna have to be limited toavoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on thetelescope's observing time, Oliver said.Terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have beendelayed much longer.There ha to be a point where you say they have to go theirway and we have to go ours, he said of the astronauts.When the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizinggyroscopes stopped working; later, engineer got them back on line.The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyro, said DaveDrachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. That, too,kept it in the safe mode.Oliver said it would be Saturday morning before the telescope isbrought out of the safe mode. It will take another day to get theinstrument operating normally again, putting controller at Goddardseveral day behind.We're trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut anycorners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at riskhere and we want to make sure we're doing it properly, Oliversaid. We've got a long future ahead of u, and we want to makesure it start off on the right foot.NASA said the telescope wa safe and in a stable position.Tolerances for the telescope system were set particularlynarrow for the first operation and that wa the cause of manymalfunctions, Terry said. In addition to that trouble, there weretwo communication outage totaling several hours.We're cautious, and that's natural, Terry said. We've gota very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anythingto jeopardize the usefulness. . We'll get to the point where weknow exactly what the spacecraft will do and set t ","AP900425-0013,AP900426-0135,AP900424-0048,AP900424-0096,AP900425-0146,AP900428-0050,AP900427-0146,AP900426-0185,AP900421-0075,AP900425-0198,AP900424-0081,AP900427-0083",How the Hubble Space Telescope Finally Got Into Orbit,"After a delay of seven years caused by technical problems and the Challenger accident, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched on space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990 and four days later was orbiting on its own 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere. The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,
28,d099e,"And for the sentimentalist, there will be 83-year-old Johnny Kelleystarting in his 60th Boston Marathon. There have only been 35 edition of thisrace run without him.; The last three Boston marathon have turned intoreckless speed duel. They have produced five of the top 10 time and eight ofthe top 15 in the race's storied history.; They also have resulted in arace of attrition, with many of the early speedsters burning out completely orfaltering in the late stages.; Along the historic route that begin inHopkinton, west of Boston, and end in Copley Square in the Back Bay sectionof the city, checkpoint record have fallen at an alarming rate.; Forexample, all 11 checkpoint record were shattered through the first 20 mileslast year, either by Simon Robert Naali or Juma Ikangaa, both of Tanzania.Neither won.; The winner wa 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, whooutsmarted the early pacesetter by running a patient, calculating race.;Running alone about 200 meter behind a pack of six Africans, Bordin passedthem all by 21 mile and went on to win in 2 hour, 8 minute, 19 second, thesecond-fastest time in the race's history, behind only the 2:07:51 by Rob deCastella in 1986.; Ikangaa finished a distant second in 2:09:52. It wa histhird consecutive runner-up finish in Boston.; Ikangaa is back again, alongwith several other formidable Africans. They include Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya,the 1988 winner in 2:08:43, the third-fastest time in Boston and one secondahead of Ikangaa; Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia, the 1989 champion in 2:09:06,Boston's eighth-best time; Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya, the 1987 world championand 1988 Olympic silver medalist who is making his Boston debut; and Naali,the third-place finisher in the 1990 Commonwealth Games.; Among thosechasing them will be John Treacy, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist and thethird-place finisher in Boston in 1988 and 1989; Geoff Smith, the Bostonwinner in 1984-85; Ed Eyestone, the top-ranked US. marathoner; SalvadorGarcia, the runner-up to Wakiihuri in last year's New York City Marathon; andRolando Vera, who finished third in his marathon debut in Boston in 1990.;The women's division also is filled with many respectable entrants.;Foremost among them are Kristiansen, the 35-year-old Norwegian who hold theworld record of 2:21:06 and won in Boston in 1986 and 1989, and Samuelson, 33,the U.S.-record holder at 2:21:21, 1984 Olympic gold medalist and Bostonchampion in 1979 and 1983.; Challenging them will be Uta Pippig, WandaPanfil and Kim Jones.; Pippig finished second in Boston last year in acareer-best 2:28:03. Panfil won the London Marathon in 2:26:31, her personalbest, and won the New York City Marathon in 1990.TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and oneof the most prestigious event of the Games will be held. It is also withoutdoubt the most gruelling. Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollutionlevels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men'smarathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run. There arelots of figure to show why. It is estimated that when the race begin inMataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be analready-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards the marathon's end, however, radiantheat thrown off by building could be subjecting the runner to atemperature of up to 30`C. More debilitating still, relative humidity inBarcelona in August rise a high a 80 per cent. With more than 10kilometres still to go, most of the course is an upward run. The last 4.6km,which take the runner 60m higher still to the Olympic stadium at the top ofthe hill of Montjuic, ha an average gradient of more than 4.5 per cent, andincludes some section of 7 per cent, equivalent in skiing term to a steep'red' run. But we do not need figure to convince u of the extraordinarydifficulty of tomorrow's race. Last Saturday, in the Olympic stadium, Iwatched the final moment and aftermath of the women's marathon, begun atthe same time of day and run in similar condition. Never in any eventvoluntarily entered into, sporting or otherwise, have I seen such sign ofphysical and mental distress. The race wa won by the Unified Team'sValentina Yegorova in 2 hour 32 minute, a time considerably slower thanthat achieved by woman on le demanding Olympic marathon course in LosAngeles and Seoul. After her nearest competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, camein eight second later, they had the energy - between bout of grimacing andlowering their head to their knee - to embrace each other and smile forthe cameras.It wa a different story in the 'mixed zone,' the area under the stadiumwhere athlete recover after their event. As runner after runner stumbledand limped into the room - several were brought in senseless on stretcher -the scene seemed to be populated by exhausted boat people rescued afterweeks of exposure and deprivation at sea.As a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face,Manuela Machado of Mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into apotted palm. Several competitor lay prone and gasping on the ground aswater wa poured over them; others stood hunched over, grasping theirabdomens.If anyone moved at all, it wa with agonised face and the slowest ofhobbles. These are not the sort of scene likely to promote enthusiasm formarathon running or for the ideal of Olympic competition.Chris Brasher, organiser of the London marathon, wa on hand to witness thesuffering, and wa incensed. Male marathon runner will face the same kindof problem with heat, humidity, and an over-demanding terrain, he said.In his opinion, gearing the marathon to prime-time TV viewing and having theevent end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectator wasunjustified and a 'sell-out to commercialism.'To put on the marathon in the late afternoon, rather than first thing inthe morning (the normal practice), and then to make them run 4km up a hillis just criminal in my opinion,' said Brasher, a former Olympic gold medalathlete and noted sportswriter.I spoke to Britain's Steve Brace, winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and1990, the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event.He agrees that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regardsOlympic marathon running a a pinnacle of his career, he is cautious abouttomorrow's slog.Like almost all the athlete running tomorrow, Brace is a professionalrunner who specialises in marathon. He take an objective, long-term viewof his profession. As an income-earner, marathon running is an activity withliabilities and limitation, and requires business management a well asphysical ability.The winner of the London marathon earns a tidy Dollars 50,000 and the NewYork, Boston and Japanese run are all in the same prize-winning category.But these and le financially-rewarding event are physically debilitating,and can only be won if a competitor is in top physical shape.With their career and financial prospect in mind, top-level runnersnormally only run two marathon a year. As Brace say, when you have onlytwo pay-days out of 365, you choose, plan and train for them with greatcare.Brace train extremely carefully indeed. 'Running a marathon is the easypart,' he say. 'The hard part is the lead-up to achieving the performancelevel required.' He start training three month before an event by running80 mile a week and then building progressively. For the last six week heruns 120 mile a week.Normally he would hope that such a routine brings a pay-off. But the Olympicmarathon is an exception: the only top-level marathon that carry no prizemoney. Brace say that in spite of the prestige and possible financialspin-offs involved, 'it doe not necessarily make sense to run to win.'Given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preservephysical condition for race that do bring in money, he say, many runnerswill give le than their best effort.Nonetheless, there are plenty whose consideration stretch beyond the purelyfinancial. Italian Gelindo Bordin, who came first in the 1988 Seoul Olympicmarathon, is a strong contender. So is Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who camethird in Seoul. Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi of Japan arealso possible winners.None of them, though, will make a molehill out of the steep and formidableascent of Montjuic.A crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here March 1 to run 26 mile, 385 yard. And cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsor and licensee. Makers of car, soda pop, sportswear, copier, computer -- even a hospital -- have tagged their name to the Los Angeles Marathon. In the promoter's word, this run is ""a marketing event on legs,"" reflecting marathoning's growing importance in upscale product promotion. Runners, it seems, are a well-heeled lot. A study by Mercedes-Benz found that 42% of family head making $40,000 a year or more jog regularly. Of potential buyer showing up at Mercedes dealer, 47% are jogger. With those number in mind, the car maker ha become a sponsor of three marathon -- in New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- a well a other running race. Marathons have had corporate backing for some time. But Los Angeles is ahead of the pack in making distance running a commercial spectacle. The city that invented the corporate-sponsored Olympics ha created a marathon unlike others -- artfully dressed a an Olympic-type amateur race, but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that control it -- a well a for the city. ""I took air and made an event,"" say William Burke, the founder and president of Los Angeles Marathon Inc. For a man whose running day ended with his high school track team, Mr. Burke is turning a lot of head in the world of marathoning. Last year, it first time out, the Los Angeles race attracted nearly 11,000 runner -- four time the number forecast and enough to make it the third -- largest race in the US. The event also pulled in about $4 million in cash and service from it sponsor, leaving the organizer with $370,000 in red ink. This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect to gross about $5 million in cash and service and to break even. Next year, they say, a profit is possible. More than 18,000 runner are expected this year. An audience of perhaps a million and a half or more will line the route, drawn in part by advertisement on 75 million Coca-Cola can and 2,500 billboard around the Los Angeles area. Marketing expert say the festive atmosphere of big crowd in the street make marathon attractive to sponsor. For the cost of a 30-second ad on the Super Bowl, a company can sponsor a marathon and ""take over a city,"" say Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Reports, a Chicago-based newsletter. The Los Angeles organizer and sponsor have perhaps done more than their counterpart elsewhere to publicize the event. Los Angelenos are seeing plug for the race on million of grocery bag, milk carton and loaf of bread, in addition to soda can, billboard and other source. The venerable New York Marathon is taking note. The New York Road Runners Club, organizer of the race, stopped promoting the event some year ago because it had all the runner it wanted. Now, Fred Lebow, the group's president, say he is encouraging sponsor to promote the race a the Los Angeles sponsor do. The promotion in Los Angeles is unabashed. ""We tell people that if they're looking for a new way to crack the Los Angeles market, this is it,"" say Mr. Burke. The pitch ha attracted the like of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles; Vons Cos., a large supermarket chain; the Los Angeles Times; the Sears Savings Bank unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc. One supporter is Ellesse USA, a sportswear and shoe producer. A $50,000 fee enables the company to use the marathon's name in it ads; Ellesse will spend an additional $100,000 dressing race personnel in T-shirts and warm-up suit, showing it clothes at the marathon's public ""Expo"" of sponsors' ware, and posting a dozen big street banner along the course. The company ha rented more than 500 billboard at a cut-rate price of $120,000 from Patrick Media Group, a marathon sponsor. The discount, about 50%, wa important. ""We couldn't have bought that kind of exposure normally,"" say Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director. Ellesse, which also sponsor the New York run, find the West Coast event more freewheeling. ""They have let u do whatever we want,"" say Ms. Cialone. For instance, product banner along the route -- almost impossible to arrange in New York -- are a snap in Los Angeles. The city, in fact, is a partner in the race. After competitive bidding, it awarded an eight-year contract to Los Angeles Marathon Inc. to put on the race. The exclusive franchise call for the race organizer this year to pay a minimum $60,000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipt to the city. The organizer also will pay the cost of city service for the marathon, estimated at $100,000. The race sponsor and city official are trading freely on the good will generated by Los Angeles's role a host of the 1984 Olympics. The logo of the marathon is a shield with laurel wreath. Some poster show the Los Angeles Coliseum with it torch and giant Olympic symbol. ""The World Returns to Los Angeles,"" proclaims one Mercedes-Benz ad. Race director are called ""commissioners,"" a term borrowed from the 1984 Olympic organization, in which Mr. Burke wa commissioner of tennis. And like the Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portraying the race a a civic celebration, thrives on volunteer. Some 7,500 people will work for free to monitor the course on race day. And two-thirds of the race's office staff work without pay. ""I couldn't buy this,"" Mr. Burke say, gesturing around the crowded race headquarters. Not everyone work for free. Big-name runner, for instance, want to be paid a lot. And here, the organizer have pinched penny. While some runner will be paid to appear, this year's field, like last year's, lack some of the superstar who race in Boston, New York and London. Grete Waitz, one of the best woman marathoner, wanted $100,000 to appear in Los Angeles; she wa turned down. Mr. Burke say the Australian runner Rob de Castella made it known through his agent that he wouldn't run any marathon in the spring but, for $25000, he'd be happy to say the Los Angeles event wa tempting. Mr. Burke say he slammed down the phone. ""We won't spend extraordinary amount of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners,"" he say. Mr. de Castella's agent denies the story entirely. What Los Angeles lack in superstar, it plan to make up for in number. This year's race may challenge New York and London a the largest marathon ever run. Some 20,500 started the New York race last year. Mr. Lebow, organizer of the New York event, say next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number. For one sponsor, this may be a mixed blessing. Orthopaedic Hospital, a not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship is part of a publicity campaign, provides emergency care station along the marathon route. Last year, one of every 20 runner needed aid. Along with sprain, strain and blister came more serious case of exhaustion and hypothermia. A spokeswoman says: ""We advised 250 people to quit the race.""The Olympic trial, scheduled for January, have made Nichols' job mucheasier this year. Most top-ranked US. woman are looking for any summer-timemarathon in which to run and the San Francisco version offer excellentconditions.; The hill of San Francisco make this marathon challenging. Theweather, however, make it one of the few enticing race held from June toSeptember. Early morning temperature range in the low 50 in late June.;""This is the only place in the world where you can have a marathon in themiddle of summer,"" Nichols said.; Defending champ back; Last year'swinner, Janis Klecker of Minnetonka, Minn., is entered. The field also boastsJanine Aiello of Albuquerque, N.M.; Michelle Bush-Cuke of Berrien Springs,Mich.; Christine Gibbons of Elmwood, N.J.; Lesley Lahane of Chestnut Hills,Mass.; Julie Shea-Graw of Raleigh, N.C., and Jane Welzel of Fort Collins,Colo.; All seven woman have run marathon under the 2-hour, 40-minutebarrier. Klecker turned in a 2:39:52 on the 26.2-mile course.; Welzel isthe 1990 national champion, Gibbons ha won 26 marathon, Lahane is a formercross-country national champion and Aiello twice ha finished second in SanFrancisco.; A test for Shea-Graw; Shea-Graw, 32, finished third in the 1981New York City Marathon and wa consistently ranked among the top five Americanrunners throughout most of the early '80s. She wa the top qualifier for the1980 Olympics team that missed the Moscow Summer Games because of a U.S.boycott.; This will be Shea-Graw's first race outside of North Carolinasince 1986, when she took time off to have a child.; ""I've run some localraces,"" Shea-Graw said. ""This is going to be a test for me. If it go well,then I'll up the ante and give my training the time that is needed to becomecompetitive again.""; Shea-Graw's best time is 2:30:11.; ""I had somemajor injury and wanted to have a child,"" Shea-Graw said. ""But now it's timeto get on with my career""Mr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his60th Boston Marathon. And even at the age of 83, he probablywill finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runnersexpected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April15.Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plansto run again this year, marvel at Mr. Kelley: ""It'sincomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing.I'm struggling at the age of 43. . . . This isn't golf.""Even the thought of running a course of 26 mile and 385yards leaf some of Mr. Kelley's rival of yesteryeargasping. ""Aghast is more like it,"" say Leslie Pawson, 86, athree-time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half acentury ago. ""My doctor says: `No running, whatsoever.' Ican't even remember when I ran my last marathon.""John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time whenmarathoners did it for glory and cab fare. A two-time winnerin Boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven time, Mr.Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year-- a he ha been for 15 yearsMr. Kelley is such an institution that Hopkinton, Mass.,where the race begin, ha made him an honorary citizen.(""That mean I don't have to pay tax there,"" he jokes.) Twostate trooper will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr.Kelley into Boston so he won't be trampled by ""groupies,"" ashe call them, clamoring to shake his hand. Last year, fiveJapanese runner were waved away by the bodyguard, a theysidled up to the old celebrity during the race. Recalls SuniTomomitsu, one of the runners: ""At first we thought, `Ohwow, he's like Mafia man.' Then we said, `Oh no, this is niceJohnny Kelley.' In Japan, he is awesome.""Though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the BostonMarathon, Mr. Kelley is the oldest to run it. Peter Foley,who wa born in 1859, wa a regular until he wa well intohis 80. But he walked the course. Starting at dawn (sixhours before the official noon start), Mr. Foley wouldeventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight.Of course, Mr. Kelley -- not to be confused with the otherJohn Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn't therunner he wa in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hour, 32minutes, 7 second. His best time ever wa in 1945: 2 hours,30 minute, 40 second. Last year he finished in 5 hour, 5minutes. He hope to do better in 1991. ""That's not aprediction, just a goal,"" he says.When John Kelley first toed the line in 1928, George Bushwasn't yet in kindergarten, Joe DiMaggio wa an unknown andNike wa the winged goddess of victory, not a running shoe.In those day, Mr. Kelley recall, he ran in black leatherhigh-jumping shoe that he cut open at the toe with a razorblade. ""I would have loved to run with the worst pair ofsneakers on the market today,"" he says.Back then, the sport didn't have much of a following.Today, of course, the Boston Marathon is a big deal, coveredby TV from start to finish and offering $402,000 altogetherin prize money.""The winner get a medal and $55,000,"" say Mr. Kelley. ""Igot a medal and beef stew. God bless them,"" he add. ""Theydeserve it.""The rosy-cheeked, supple Mr. Kelley is a medical wonder.Each year, he visit the Cooper Clinic at the Aerobics Centerin Dallas for a battery of endurance test. ""Physiologically,whatever that mean, I got all A's,"" Mr. Kelley report ofhis checkup four month ago.""What that means,"" explains Kenneth Cooper, the physicianwho wrote ""Aerobics"" and several sequel and is now at workon a book on elderly athlete, ""is that Johnny ha the bodyof a man 23 year younger. He's going to be one of the starsof my book."" Mr. Kelley's resting pulse rate -- 60 beat aminute -- is well below the average person's 72 beats.(That's good.) On the stress test the clinic give, Mr.Kelley hold the endurance record for his age group.A mechanic for Boston Edison Co. before he retired in1972, Mr. Kelley started running in the evening after workmore than six decade ago. His only purpose wa to relax andhave some fun. ""All day long, I did what my bos told me todo,"" he recall. ""But when I ran at night, I felt free. I rantill I wa exhausted.""In 1928, when he wa 21, he entered his first BostonMarathon but didn't finish. He dropped out three-quarters ofthe way through the race. Then, in 1933, he finished 37th ina field of about 200 runner. In all the year since, he hasmissed the race just once, in 1967. (He ha competed, alltold, in 112 marathon, including the 1936 and 1948 OlympicsMr. Kelley well know the jagged course from Hopkinton todowntown Boston:The first challenge come five mile into the race, wherea set of little hill can get a psyched runner to wasteenergy charging up the slope. A mile and a half later,there's new reason to beware: The smell of Cavanaugh'sBakery can set off hunger pangs.An Exxon station in Wellesley mark the halfway point. Asteep descent into Newton Lower Falls can jar a tiredrunner's bone. Then, at the end of a long column of oak andmaple tree, is Heartbreak Hill, his nemesis. It cost him atleast two victory, he say. And finally there's the HauntedMile, a stretch where many runner have collapsed. Boston'sskyline, 2 1/2 mile in the distance, can seem so far away.Though still going strong, Mr. Kelley acknowledges themarathon get tougher each year. To compensate, he trainsharder. He used to start preparing in earnest at the end ofJanuary. ""In recent year, I've been in training 12 month ayear,"" he say, though the serious stuff -- a daily one-hourrun, sprint on the track and long, 2 1/2-hour run everyother week -- begin in December. (He doesn't count the mileshe put in, a many long-distance runner obsessively do, buthe say he wouldn't object to an estimate of about 50 mile aweek)Mr. Kelley always train at 5 a.m., and alone: ""It's aquiet time, no traffic; the air is fresh and sweet."" Hisroutes vary. In January, he prefers the frozen sand of thebeach. With the approach of spring, he take to the alder andscrub-pine hill and bluff where the sun can be seen risingover Cape Cod Bay. After his morning run, he spends a coupleof hour painting (still life and Cape Cod scenes), a hobbyhe took up about 25 year ago.Unlike many runner, Mr. Kelley doesn't bother withstretching exercise before he run in the morning. ""This ismy warm up: I empty the dishwasher, I set up the coffeepot,but I don't plug it in. I set up the breakfast table. Then Icheck the outside temperature to see what clothes to wear.""He and his wife, Laura, live in a two-bedroom ranch-stylehouse here in East Dennis, with more than 350 trophies,medals and sweat-stained marathon number scattered about. Heisn't particular about brand of shoe (""I wear them all"") orwhat he eats (""I never eat broccoli, but I love steak and icecream"")Mr. Kelley aim to run till he is at least 100 year old.""He's a strange man,"" say Laura Kelley, in awe of herhusband's vigor. The 82-year-old Mrs. Kelley add, ""I justtry to stay in his shadow, but I have a hard time even doingthat.""In a rare moment of reflection, Mr. Kelley explains whatmakes him tick: ""I paint because I like it. I run because Ilike it. If for some reason I don't finish the marathon, Idon't owe an apology to anyone. But I'll tell you, the BostonMarathon -- with all those people waving -- is better than mybirthday.""Television watcher of the 19th annual New YorkCity Marathon followed the step-by-step progress Sunday of theleaders, but many spectator on the course scanned the thousand ofrunners for a familar face.The winner in the field of 23,478 largest ever for a marathon wa Steve Jones of Wales, who finished in 2 hour, 8 minute and 20seconds, only seven second off the course record. Grete Waitz ofNorway won the women's division for a record ninth time in 2:28:07.Marybeth Torpe wa hoping another runner would run fast herboyfriend Tony Giannelli.She and several others had staked out the corner table at arestaurant on First Avenue to get a good view of the runner a theyromped off the Queensboro Bridge.Their hope on seeing Giannelli depended on how fast the Yonkersnative ran. We have to leave this table by 12:30.

He wa thelast survivor among the national leader of the World War II era.But in his first 20 year, the Son of Heaven wa worshiped asa divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu.The solitude of animal and plant life under the sea which sointrigued Hirohito wa in keeping with the character of the man whobecame the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of25 on Christmas Day 1926, designating his reign Showa enlightened peace.The emperor wa generally portrayed a having played nosignificant role in planning or carrying out Japan's militaryadventures in the 1930s and 1940s. But it wa his first effectivedecision a emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacificconflict.On Aug. 10, 1945, four day after history's first atomic bombdevastated Hiroshima and one day after a US. bomber dropped thesecond atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the general and admiral ofImperial Japan's wartime government argued for hour in thesweltering bombproof shelter beneath the Tokyo palace.Should Japan agree to the Allies' surrender demand, or fight onuntil annihilation?Speaking in what some of those present described a a slow andobviously nervous monotone, Hirohito, the spiritual and titularleader, offered his opinion for the first time. He spoke of hissorrow over the soldier and sailor killed in the long war, and offamilies who lost everything in air raids.I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer, hesaid. Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and torelieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it isburdened.Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor Meiji,whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 year of feudal Japaneseisolation from the outside world, Hirohito told the officers:The time ha come when we must bear the unbearable.In the day that followed, Hirohito continued his break withtradition. In a national radio broadcast Aug. 15 the first timeordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice he personallyannounced the decision to surrender.He told the ravaged nation that the war situation ha developednot necessarily to our advantage.Three week later, Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat, stripedtrousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. Douglas A.MacArthur, at the US. Embassy in Tokyo. It wa the first timeHirohito had ever gone to see anyone, and the first of several callson the general who had led the Pacific war against Japan and becameits postwar governor.On New Year's Day 1946, at MacArthur's insistence, the emperorpublicly renounced his divinity. It wa a choice that enabledHirohito to remain a the symbolic head of his nation and assuredthat he would not face charge a a war criminal, a some abroad haddemanded.It also wa an act that seemed to relieve no one a much a thisgentle, shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable a aliving god.The emperor's status in the eye of many Japanese changed to thatof a kind uncle.He became a widely respected authority on marine biology. Hepossessed rare collection of marine life, discovered severalspecies himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 book onhydrozoa, or sea animal, his specialty.In recent year, his life had become the subject of a popularcomic book series.Still, Hirohito and the imperial system remained important toJapan.A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun inMarch 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polledsupported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it shouldbe abolished. Five percent said the emperor should have more power.From 1946 to 1954, Hirohito toured Japan to encourage the peopleto rebuild.The Imperial Household Agency, which ran his affair, saidHirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfillingtimes of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recoveryfrom a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives.Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, Hirohitoremained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency.Protocol wa maintained at nearly all time and he wa prohibitedfrom speaking on any controversial subject.Hirohito wa born on April 29, 1901. In accordance with age-oldimperial custom, he wa taken from his parent a an infant to bereared in isolation by household functionary and trained for onerole, that of emperor.His education came a Japan surged into the modern world. Thefeudal samurai ethic wa still strong; when his grandfather died,Gen. Maresuke Nogi, the mentor for the 11-year-old prince, calmlycommitted ritual suicide to follow the emperor, his master, to thegrave.Hirohito studied government and law with private tutor. When hewas 20, his father, Emperor Taisho, sent him abroad the first timeany member of the immediate imperial family wa allowed outsideJapan.Hirohito visited England, Scotland, France, Belgium, theNetherlands and Italy, receiving various decoration.

An LA newspaperpublished a letter to the editor after Hirohito's death alsoquestioning his innocence.","Emperor Hirohito, who died on January 7 of cancer after several months of internal bleeding, left a taxable estate of approximately $13 million. Posthumously named Showa, or Enlightened Peace, the name of his reign, Hirohito will be remembered for his most courageous decision in his 62-year reign: Japan must surrender and end the Pacific conflict in WW II.Though many world leaders mourned his death, painful WW II memories sparked criticism of the monarch. South Korea sent condolences, but a government party statement added, ""We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past."" A Taiwanese newspaper noted that ""while Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe..."", he did not direct a single word to China..."" Generally portrayed as having had no significant role in the war, a BBC documentary by Edward Behr challenged this view, alleging that Hirohito had advance knowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack. The show also claims that President Truman decided not to prosecute Hirohito for war crimes, and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen.Tojo, was pressured into changing his testimony to avoid incriminating the emperor. A letter to the editor of an LA newspaper after Hirohito's death also expressed doubt that he was blameless.","Emperor Hirohito, controversial World War II  leader of Japan dies.","Emperor Hirohito of Japan died in 1989 at the age of 87 after a long illness.

EastGermany had 102 medal and 37 gold, and the United States 94 medalsand 36 gold.Many felt that the United States wa robbed of a second-placetie for gold when judge awarded a bout to a South Korean boxerover American Roy Jones in the 156-pound event on the final day ofcompetition.Because of boycott in 1980 and 1984, the Games were the firstmeeting between the Soviet Union and the United States since 1976in Montreal, and matchup between the two nation provided some ofthe Games' highlights.The US. men's volleyball team beat the Soviets to defend its1984 Olympic championship, providing consolation for America'supset in the men's basketball quarterfinal. America also defeatedthe Soviets in women's basketball and men's water polo.At least 1 billion people watched the Olympics via a 115-nation,worldwide TV hookup. The Seoul Games had the greatest number ofathletes (9633), the most country, the most gold medal and themost venue (34).Communist North Korea, which demanded a role in the Games,boycotted them, but the only sport power to follow suit wa Cuba.Among the highlights:Greg Louganis won the Olympic Spirit Award a top Americanathlete Sunday for winning gold medal in platform and 3-meterspringboard diving. He accomplished the same feat in 1980 andbecame the first man to sweep the event twice.The 28-year-old Louganis, who hit his head on the board in thepreliminaries and received five stitch, announced his retirementfrom diving and said he wanted to pursue acting.Sisters-in-law Florence Griffith Joyner and JackieJoyner-Kersee led an American assault on the record book in trackand field.Griffith Joyner won gold in the 100, the 200 and the 400-meterrelay, and silver in the 1,600-meter relay.

This time, 138 medal were handed out.The Soviets finished first in both number of gold medal, with11, and total medal, with 29, a record for the Winter Olympics.East Germany's athlete won nine gold, 25 overall; whileSwitzerland's team came in third in both gold medal, five, andoverall medal, 15.Four other team also bested the United States in term ofoverall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.The late Jesse Owens, whose performance at the1936 Olympics put the lie to Hitler's boast of racial superiority,picked up a fifth gold medal Wednesday for humanitariancontributions in the race of life.President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to hiswidow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attendedby three daughter and teammate of the track legend.This Saturday mark the 10th anniversary of Owens' death at age66.The president later hailed Owens's multiple gold medal in theBerlin game a victory for humanity in prepared remark to abanquet sponsored by the US. Olympic Committee.The Olympics, like democracy, are a kind of dialogue a waythat nation can converse in the language of friendly competition,not deadly conflict, Bush said.Bush called Owens, who wa black, an Olympic hero and anAmerican hero every day of his life . born with the gift ofburning speed.He wa always the fastest, said Bush, recalling theafternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three worldrecords and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes.Talk about a guy in a hurry, Bush laughed. He wa theepitome of that.At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens captured four goldmedals in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and400-meter relay.The Berlin Games were to be the showcase of Hitler's theorieson the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kidshowed up, Bush said. It wa an unrivaled athletic triumph. Butmore than that, it really wa a triumph for all humanity.Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it wa not thoseathletic feat but his humanitarian contribution in the race oflife that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.Owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving a aspecial ambassador for sport, said Bush. He said the athlete'slegacy life on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playgroundOlympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletesand the Jesse Owens Foundation, which award scholarship to needyyouth.Despite the many honor, his greatest satisfaction came fromhis work with youth, said Mrs. Owens, 74.Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were formerOlympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; formerteammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and twoOhio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, whospearheaded the drive to strike the medal.The silver-haired Mrs. Owens, standing outside the White Houseafterwards, called the event absolutely beautiful. She added:I'm sure with the sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us,too.The 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't even over when advertiser began clamoring for pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton. She went on to grin relentlessly through some $5 million worth of commercial endorsement -- surely an Olympic record in itself. But when the 1988 Summer Games ended Sunday night, so, too, did the chance for American athlete to follow in her footstep. Ad agency executive, who spend every fourth year glued to their TV set, hoping to pick out the next star to hawk their clients' product, say that this Olympiad wa a dud. ""I suspect this will go down a the dullest in the history of the Olympics,"" say Jerry Della Femina, chairman of ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS. ""This is the first Olympics without passion, and without passion you don't have testimonial. Without hero, you don't have anyone that anyone want to emulate."" On the surface, the Games seemed to offer all the drama that usually make for lucrative endorsement contract. Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking his head on the springboard, then coming back to win two gold medal? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, her two-inch fingernail raking the air a she won the 100-meter sprint? But even these two, along with Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won the women's heptathalon and the long jump, may find it more difficult than in previous year to turn gold medal into gold in the bank. The fact is, say many marketer, Olympic gold ha lost much of it commercial luster. ""I don't think it's big money like it used to be,"" say Michael Goldberg of National Media Group Inc., the New York sports-marketing firm that represents Ms. Retton. ""It used to be kind of a knee-jerk reaction to do an ad campaign around an Olympic athlete. It just doesn't happen anymore."" Certainly, this year's winning Olympians will have no trouble securing contract from specialized sports-equipment outfitter and speaking invitation from obscure trade group. But the major, high-paying endorsement -- such a those with soft-drink company and fast-food outlet -- just don't seem to be surfacing, at least not yet. Earlier this year, sport marketer estimated that a gold medal won during the Summer Games could earn a personable athlete more than $1 million in endorsement. Now, marketer say, these medalist will be lucky to pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year. Advertisers can reel off a litany of reason why these Olympics aren't igniting much spark. For one thing, they suffer by comparison with the 1984 Summer Games, so exciting because they were held in Los Angeles and because, in the absence of boycotting Soviet-bloc country, the Americans won 83 gold medal. The 1988 Games, by contrast, were broadcast from halfway around the world, and the Soviets trounced the Americans, 55 gold medal to 36. What's more, marketer say, this year's drug scandal cast a pall over the Games, especially the incident involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who lost his gold medal after testing positive for steroid. NBC's TV coverage also get it share of the blame. Marketers say it wa so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there wa little chance for excitement to build. The constant commercial interruption, which led to rating that were much lower than expected, didn't help, either. During most of the past Games, ""there wa enough continuous TV coverage so that, much like a soap opera, it wa possible to get involved in the life and in the competition,"" say Leigh Steinberg, attorney for ice-skater Brian Boitano, a gold medalist at the 1988 Winter Games. But not this summer, he say. Recent change in Olympic rule, meanwhile, have led to a glut of Olympians in search of endorsement deal. Before the 1984 Games, most Olympic athlete weren't allowed to make commercial unless they gave up their amateur status. Now, they can appear in a many ad a they want, but the income must go into a trust fund for training expense. ""Every year, more and more Olympic people are out there wanting to do commercial -- basically, everybody is available,"" say Daisy Sinclair, a vice president with ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As a result, while once an ""aura"" surrounded an Olympian, now ""the bloom is off."" Companies also are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to celebrity endorsement. Increasingly cost conscious, they will no longer hook up with an Olympian just because the company president like the athlete's sport. And after year of paying big buck to Olympic star only to see them fade into obscurity, company have finally gotten the hint that Olympian fame is of the most fleeting variety. ""If you think your phone will ring off the hook if (you win) a gold medal, it isn't going to happen anymore,"" say Stephen Disson, senior vice president of marketing for ProServ Inc., a Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies now know that ""six month from now there will be other hero from other sporting events"" for them to consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude toward the Olympics is becoming typical. It us sport star in it commercial for Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds but ha no plan to call on any of 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer to use athlete who are in the public eye on a regular basis, like football and basketball players,"" say Charles Miesmer, the agency's executive creative director. ""People like Michael Jordan have 10-plus year in their sport career, all in a row, so I don't have to worry about the public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And don't look for any of 1988's winner to start showing up on Wheaties box, either. General Mills Inc., which ha featured Ms. Retton and decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner on it Wheaties box in the past, say it look for three quality in an endorser: career achievement, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishment. A spokeswoman say that none of this year's crop meet all three criterion. So far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee ha had the most visible endorsement. Even before the Olympics began, she had made commercial for Primatene mist and 7-Up. And, according to her agent, Pearl Hodge of World Class Management, she is now ""in the process"" of signing with McDonald's Corp., to work on behalf of it effort to aid underprivileged child. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take the endorsement lead. Advertisers say with her good look and fashion flare, she is attracting more interest than any of the other medal winner. (The sprinter's manager couldn't be reached for comment.) Another Olympian with endorsement potential is swimmer Matt Biondi, who won five gold medal. Mr. Biondi ha already signed a swim-wear contract with Arena USA Inc., and Parkes Brittain, his agent at Advantage International Inc., say his client ""will definitely be in a high-income ring, the highest you can name."" Then there is Mr. Louganis. Since winning two gold medal during the 1984 Summer Olympics, the diver ha had little luck with major endorsement. And a few marketing executive say that even his second sweep of the diving event may not up his potential. ""When most advertiser are looking for the male hero, the word 'macho' trail along very closely,"" say Marty Blackman of Blackman & Raber, a sports-marketing firm in New York. ""I don't find Louganis a macho guy."" Still, other marketing professional say that Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery after smashing his head ha secured the diver's future. His manager, Jim Babbitt, won't comment on any contract offer. He will say, however, that his client ha ""done just fine. He isn't unhappy. He dive to perform; he doesn't dive for dollars."" ---Winning EndorsementsThere is only one former Olympian among the top sport endorser of last year.ATHLETE: Arnold Palmer (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Hertz, PaineWebber, Pennzoil, United Airlines, GTE, Toro, Loft Seed Co., Sears, Pro Group, Robert Bruce, Westin HotelsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $8 millionATHLETE: Jack Nicklaus (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Bostonian Shoe Co., Hart Schaffner & Marx, Optique Du Monde, Pine Hosiery Mills, WarnacoESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Boris Becker (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Coca-Cola, Deutsche Bank, Polaroid, UNICEFESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Greg Norman (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Reebok, Spalding, Epson Computers, Hertz, Qantas Airlines, Daikyo Group, Swan Lager & Castlemaine, Akubia HatsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4.5 millionATHLETE: Michael Jordan (Basketball, 1984 Olympian)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Nike, Wilson, Excelsior, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Johnson Products, Ohio ArtESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4 millionATHLETE: Ivan Lendl (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Gleneagles Country Club, Avis, Seiko, Adidas, Bow Brand StringsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: John Madden (Former football coach)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Ace Hardware, Miller Lite, Ramada, Exxon, Canon, GreyhoundESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: Jim McMahon (Football)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Taco Bell, Kraft Foods, Ebel Watches, Honda, Adidas, LJN Toys, Revo SunglassesESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionATHLETE: Dennis Conner (Yachting)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Rayban, Sperry Topsider, Wrigley's, Disney, Lacoste, Pepsi-ColaESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Chris Evert (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Lipton Iced Tea, Wilson Converse, Ellesse, Polo Club of Boca Raton, Rolex, Evert Active Life Skin Care, Marchon Sunwear for EllesseESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Martina Navratilova (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Lufthansa Airlines, Vuarnet, DHL, Sugar-Free Jello, Aspen Club, RKO Video, World Tennis MagazineESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Jackie Stewart (Retired race car driver)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Ford, Goodyear, USF&G, Rolex, Gleneagles, American Express, British Telecom, ICCIESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionSource: Sports Marketing NewsletterDebi Thomas' dream of Olympic goldturned into disappointment Saturday a East Germany's Katarina Wittwon her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian ElizabethManley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen.It's over. Back to school, said Thomas, who won the bronzemedal despite three faulty landing. I'm not going to make anyexcuses. I wa really skating well this week. It wasn't supposed tohappen, I guess. But I tried.While the top two skater in the world staged a shootout tomusic from Bizet's Carmen, Manley wa so sensational in thefreestyle that she finished first with seven judge. Combined witha fourth in the compulsory figure and a third-place finish in theshort program earlier in the week, the performance put Manley insecond place.Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became thefirst repeat single champion since Dick Button took Olympic goldin 1948 and '52. Sonja Henie of Norway wa the only woman to do itbefore Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S.figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion, skated poorlySaturday after doing well earlier in the Games.By contrast, Manley had the sellout crowd at the OlympicSaddledome enraptured. They cheered, hooted and stamped their feetwhen she finished hitting every element of her program.Jill Trenary of Minnetonka, Minn., finished fourth. She wasfifth heading into the long program, worth 50 percent of theoverall score.Thomas' bronze wa the third figure skating medal here for theUnited States. Brian Boitano won the men's crown, and a bronze inpairs went to Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard.In addition to the three figure skating medal, the US. teamhad three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze.Speed skater Bonnie Blair, America's only double medalist, triedagain Saturday in the 1,500 meter but finished fourth, well offthe pace. She won the gold in the 500 and the bronze in the 1,000meters.As the Olympics winded up it next-to-last day, the Soviet Unionhad 27 medal, including 11 gold, while East Germany in secondplace had 22, including nine golds.Florence Griffith Joyner twice smasheda world record Thursday a she blazed to a gold medal in the200-meter sprint.She also stayed on target to become the second woman to win fourtrack and field gold medal in a single Olympics.Griffith Joyner dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds,shattering the world mark she had set just 90 minute earlier inher semifinal heat. In that race, she ran 21.56, eclipsing the9-year-old mark of 21.71 set in 1979 by Marita Koch of East Germanyand equaled three time since.In her 200 quarterfinal heat Wednesday, Griffith Joyner ran anOlympic record 21.76 seconds.Griffith Joyner, who set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the100 meter, had a big lead Thursday a she turned the curve for thefinal 100 meter. She glided to the wire.I know I can run much faster, she said. I felt veryrelaxed. That's the key.Griffith Joyner, 28, is scheduled to run in the 400-meter relaySaturday and may compete in the 1,600-meter relay that day.Noted for her long, painted fingernail and racy, colorfulbodysuits, Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles ha a chance to match the1984 quadruple gold medal performance of US. sprinter and longjumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in1948.TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by thefour relay final. Tonight it is nation versus nation.What the relay demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event isthat at the Olympics the race ha traditionally gone to affluent country -or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resource on athletes.The US ha comfortably won the most relay medal, followed by Britain, theformer Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six wonbefore 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.Britain alone have won more relay medal (23) than all the Caribbean islands(nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa). The Dutch, withone, have more relay medal than all the nation of Asia (nil) and SouthAmerica (nil) combined. The Cuban women's 100 metre relay team of 1968 and1972 are the only woman from outside the developed world to have won relaymedals.With a little luck - with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relaysalways require a little luck - the developing country will continue thegentle redistribution of medal. But although they have talent, few canmatch the strength in depth of the traditional relay powers.The US 4x400m squad ha been weakened by the injury to Danny Everett. Evenso they rested Steve Lewis, the 400m silver medallist, in last night'ssemi-finals. In the 4x100m heat James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewisran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue hiseighth Olympic gold.One thing that became clear on Thursday, when Lewis won his seventh goldwith victory in the long jump, wa that while winning at the Olympics maybring other athlete excitement or relief, Lewis simply adores theexperience.When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after thewomen's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that shehad won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, a did theother 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.Lewis, on the other hand, seemed unsurprised when Mike Powell wa unable tooverhaul him in the long jump. Even though the long jump had not finishedand even though 5,000m runner were trudging through a semi-final, Lewisbegan at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour.He tried to orchestrate a Mexican wave. This is a man who derives immensepleasure from winning in front of a packed house. Lewis will be difficult tosuppress tonight.Noureddine Morcelli of Algeria will be hard to beat in the men's 1,500m.Morcelli is one of five Africans in the final striving to increase theircontinent's tally of just three Olympic medal (all Kenyan) in this event.Even here there is a US connection: Morcelli attended Riverside CommunityCollege in California, to hone his running on good tracks.On Thursday night, Morcelli cruised through his heat in first place afterthe gentlest push on the accelerator.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing groupof runners in those events.In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured manysuccessful Olympic athletes.",,,,

Sagdeyev, a member of the official funeral commission,said about 3,000 people an hour were arriving initially, but theofficial news agency Tass said that rate doubled later, making forum total of 45,000 by nighttime.Police lined the sidewalk where people waited. Sakharov's widowYelena Bonner, pleased authority were not turning people away,praised them for being very democratic.In her first detailed public comment on her husband's death,Bonner said she hope he will not be idolized.I would not wish a living person he ha lived an animated,happy life to be turned into an icon, an icon which could be usedby various force in their interest, Bonner said in an interviewbroadcast on Soviet TV.She said, however, that she hope Sakharov's writing, publishedabroad long ago, will become widely available in his homeland sothere can be a conversation of the people of the future withAndrei Dmitrievich.Mourners carried small portrait of Sakharov and red and whitecarnations to place near his coffin. One man, Sergei Kosykh,brought his 7-year-old daughter along.My daughter, who is being brought up with the belief thatthere is nobody greater than (Soviet founder Vladimir) Lenin, Ihave brought her here today just to show her the person greaterthan Lenin, he said.A middle-aged woman drew from Russian literature to reflect onSakharov's contributions.He wa like the man from one of Maxim Gorky's tale who usedhis own bleeding and living heart a a torch to lead people tolight and truth, said the woman, a teacher who declined to giveher name.Sakharov always wa telling the truth and by doing so forcedour leadership to do the same, said Boris Sorokin, a 50-year-olddesigner.Unofficial shrine sprouted outside Sakharov's southeast Moscowapartment, where candle flickered alongside his portrait. Outsidethe office of the weekly newspaper Moscow News on Pushkin Square,a popular gathering place for political activist, portrait andflowers were displayed.An entry in a notebook for mourners' comment outside Sakharov'sapartment building declared, The conscience of the nation hasdied.Moscow News an organ of the official press, which had brandedSakharov an utterly ignorant person took the rare step Sundayof publishing a special edition devoted to the activist.Four page were filled with picture of him, condolencetelegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and PresidentBush and a text of Sakharov's last public remark, a speech hedelivered hour before his death in which he said the Soviethierarchy wa leading the country to a catastrophe.On Sunday night, Soviet TV's newscast Seven Days also paidtribute to Sakharov, leading the program with a 10-minute report onhim.The Communist Party daily Pravda published a poem by YevgenyYevtushenko that read in part:History's most peaceful rebel, in dying, did not come downfrom the cross, but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric ofthe world.On Saturday, Pravda published what amounted to a public apologyto Sakharov.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leader said inan obituary that Sakharov had been the victim of grossinjustices and praised him a a man of honesty and sincerity.Bonner, Sakharov's constant companion and fellow human rightsactivist, sat closest to the coffin, clutching a black handbag andperiodically closing her eye. A son and daughter from his firstmarriage and son and daughter of Bonner also attended, along withfour grandchildren.Gorbachev wa expected to pay his last respect Monday, when thefuneral is planned, and on Sunday wa represented by Yevgeny M.Primakov, chairman of the funeral commission and a non-votingmember of the country's ruling Politburo.The foreign dignitary expected to take part in Monday'sceremonies include Lech Walesa, head of Poland's Solidaritymovement, who will be making his first trip to the Soviet Union,and former refuseniks Yosef Begun and Vladimir Slepak, who now livein Israel.Israel's best known Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky, wasrefused a visa when he applied for permission to travel to Moscow,said Sharansky's spokesman, Avraham Ben-Yaakov. Begun and Slepaksaid they would lay a wreath on Sakharov's grave in Sharansky'sname.Soviet medium once branded Andrei D. Sakharov atraitor, but a Moscow weekly ha now provided a sympatheticportrait of the human right activist and his wife.This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said thatSakharov long ago understood the need for change in the SovietUnion.The article make a clear attempt to refute some of the pastcharges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident YelenaBonner, by Soviet official and the state-controlled media.Moscow News also pointedly note that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prizewinner ha praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for social andeconomic reform.The 66-year-old Sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence intheir seventh-floor Moscow apartment, eating cabbage, beet soup,potatoes and other simple fare, and Sakharov insists on washing thedishes afterward himself, the paper said.It said their two-room home wa always filled with peopleseeking Sakharov's aid, and that the word most often heard thereare: Help me. But Moscow News asked: Can he really doeverything?Although the full-page article wa the longest on Sakharov todate in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to thenearly seven year he spent in exile after criticizing theKremlin's intervention in Afghanistan.Sakharov, a brilliant physicist, wa allowed to return to Moscowin December 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city ofGorky, where he wa banished without trial in January 1980.In effect, sometimes Sakharov bitterly joke that he'd like toreturn to Gorky for a few month to be able to work alone onscientific work, Moscow News said. Of course, concerning Gorky,that's a bitter joke.Since his return to Moscow, Sakharov ha been a vocal supporterof Gorbachev's program for nationwide reform that includes thepolicy of glasnost, or greater openness on selected topics.He simply belief that something helped change the thoughtsof the majority into state policy, Moscow News said.He callsperestroika (restructuring) an enormous event for our country andfor the entire world.However, Sakharov ha insisted on speedier progress in improvingthe Soviet record on human right, and during a Jan. 15 meeting inthe Kremlin, he handed Gorbachev a list of 200 people he said wereimprisoned for their views.Moscow News noted that in 1975, in a tract titled Knowledgeand the World, Sakharov set forth his view on Soviet affairs.Those writing have not been published in the Soviet Union.Now we can definitely see parallel between what he said then,and those idea that we are putting forward today, Moscow Newssaid.Sakharov called for a ban on nuclear testing long before theKremlin. The human right activist, one of the most prominentmembers of the dissident movement that reached it peak in the1970s, sought openness in Soviet society year before glasnostbecame Communist Party policy.Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harmcaused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaign against them.It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living inoriental luxury and engaging in scandal between spouses.Moscow News said Sakharov wa stubborn, unassuming, anundisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man withhis own view on how to deal conscientiously with world affair andthe demand of this life.His strong conviction even extend to his insistence that he dothe dish after meal, wrote the reporter who visited Sakharov athis apartment.What is that, Andrei Dmitrievich, your hobby? asked MoscowNews correspondent Gennady Zhavoronkov.Not all guest are able to wash the dish conscientiously,Sakharov replied.Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Sovietdissident movement, finally received a 1973 human right awardThursday night during his first trip to New York City.Sakharov received the Human Rights Award from the InternationalLeague for Human Rights at a reception at the home of Ronald Lauder,the former US. ambassador to Austria.The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is on his first trip tothe West, le than two year after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevfreed him from internal exile in the city of Gorky. The human rightsactivist wa banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing theSoviet occupation of Afghanistan.About 200 guest, including author Elie Wiesel, Brooklyn DistrictAttorney Elizabeth Holtzman, designer Caroline Roehm and ABCtelevision's Barbara Walters, attended the reception.The ceremony wa closed to the medium. Sakharov, wearing a blueberet and plaid scarf, made no statement a he left the receptionand entered a waiting limousine.Sakharov is the honorary president of the league, which ha itsheadquarters in the United States and more than 40 affiliate groupsaround the world, including the Moscow Human Rights Committee, whichSakharov and his colleague founded in 1971.Sakharov arrived in the United States on Sunday to visitrelatives and receive medical treatment before going to Washingtonfor a White House visit and a board meeting of the InternationalFoundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which heis a director.A Soviet newspaper ha painted a highlysympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner,countering past attack on the dissident couple once branded astraitors by the state-run media.But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned thenearly seven year Sakharov spent in forced internal exile forcriticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating thattopic is still too sensitive.In it latest issue, the weekly devoted it entire back page todescribing the home life of Sakharov, 66, the 1975 Nobel PeacePrize winner, and said the word most often heard in hisseventh-floor Moscow apartment are help me.Sakharov's apartment on a major thoroughfare ha been a meccafor Soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed toreturn from exile in the closed city of Gorky in December 1986.Since then, Sakharov, who wa one of the creator of hisnation's hydrogen bomb, ha vocally supported Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev's reform campaign, but ha called for the liberationof all political prisoner and more improvement in the field ofhuman rights.Past Soviet report, published before Gorbachev became Sovietleader, accused Bonner of marrying Sakharov for his money and saidthe couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandal betweenspouses.Moscow News depicted the couple a living peacefully andfrugally, eating cabbage, beet soup, potato, and other simplefare, and marveled that Sakharov, a member of the prestigiousAcademy of Sciences, always doe the dish himself.While Sakharov wa in exile in the closed city of Gorky, theauthor of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious andscandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow Newssaid.Sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposedthat he write an apology for all the lie that were published,the paper said.It reported that when the unidentified author refused, Sakharovsaid, It's too bad that duel are abolished in our time, andslapped him.Sakharov ha been quoted numerous time by Soviet medium sincehis return from exile, but the article in Moscow News wa thelongest devoted to him so far.But most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreigntourists and reader abroad, so relatively few Soviets would seethe Sakharov article. As well a appearing in Russian, Moscow Newsalso print edition in English, French and other languages.Andrei D. Sakharov urged member of the Academy ofSciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidate forthe new Soviet legislature, which doe not include the Nobel PeacePrize winner.The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human right activist, whowon the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that manyscientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved bythe leadership in January.Sakharov and several other well-known proponent of reform aremissing from the list. The official news agency Tass quoted him assaying, however, that scientist were upset not because Sakharovwas not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutionswas ignored.He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democraticdecision, which produced a list of what critic describe asold-guard manager of scientific institutions.A vote on the academy candidate is scheduled for Tuesday.Sakharov wa nominated from several geographic district for aseat in the new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, but hedecided to refuse the nomination and fight for an Academy ofSciences seat.Under an election law approved in December, 750 seat in thelegislature are reserved for the Communist Party and it affiliatesand for professional, social and trade union organization. Theother 1,500 will be filled by representative of the 15 Sovietrepublics and their electoral districts.Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a newround of nomination by mustering enough support to deny allnominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former politicalprisoner.That would force the academy to start over and produce a new listof nominee under term of the new election law.Twenty-five seat were allotted to the academy, but it gave fiveto affiliated society and association. From 121 nominee, theacademy leadership chose 23 candidate for the remaining 20 seats.Although 60 research institute nominated Sakharov, he wa notchosen for the final slate. The leadership's decision inspiredwidespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy'sMoscow headquarters.Tass said 1,108 academician, corresponding member andrepresentatives of reseach institute attended the three-day meetingthat began Monday.The first three day of this week may become the `hottest'spring day for Soviet scientist, it said, alluding to theleadership's rejection of such reformer a Sakharov, spacescientist Roald Sagdeev and sociologist Tatyana Zaslavsakaya.The agency acknowledged many scientist were unsatisfied withthe slate of candidates.Mironov said two other academician also spoke on Monday in favorof new nomination. No detail of their remark were available.In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S.Gorbachev and Soviet leader today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov asa man of honesty and sincerity who suffered great injustice atthe hand of previous rulers.An obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other member of theruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading official andscholars wa printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 ofthe party daily Pravda.Such obituary are reserved for favored public figure andscientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 NobelPeace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of afuneral commission in a black box on it front page.Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hour afterurging fellow member of the Congress of People's Deputies tocreate a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break itsseven-decade strangehold on political power.A distinguished scientist and public figure, a man of honestyand sincerity ha passed away, the obituary said. Everythingthat Andrei Dmitrievich did wa dictated by his conscience, hisdeep humanitarian convictions.The obituary noted Sakharov wa exiled in the industrial city ofGorky about 250 mile east of Moscow from 1980 to 1986.Gross injustice were permitted in relation to A.D.Sakharov, it said.It wa signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo member NikolaiI. Ryzhkov, Vadim A. Medvedev, Lev N. Zaikov, Alexander N. Yakovlevand Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.However, the signature of several other Politburo members,including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservativeYegor K. Ligachev were missing. Absence of their signature couldsignify that the disagreed with part of the obituary.Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, hadsaid he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.It wa Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed by Gorbachev forpermitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system,who exiled Sakharov for criticizing the Soviet intervention inAfghanistan.Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told himhe could return to Moscow.The Soviet leader told reporter at the Congress of People'sDeputies that Sakharov's death wa a great loss.Even though the two often tangled at the Congress, Gorbachevsaid he respected Sakharov. He wa not some sort of politicalintriguer, the Soviet president said Friday.Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Mondayafternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.Several hundred people gathered outside Sakharov's apartmentbuilding Friday evening, holding candle and wreathing hisphotograph in flower. Memorial service were scheduled Sunday atthe city's main youth center, and on Monday at the Lebedev physicsinstitute where Sakharov worked and the Academy of Sciences, ofwhich he wa a leading member.The popular nighttime TV program Vzglad showed a briefinterview with his widow, Yelena Bonner, discussing the funeralarrangements.The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision a a scientist,which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciencesat age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed theSoviet hydrogen bomb.But it said that Sakharov realized the danger of the weapon hehad helped create.Working on the creation of weapon of mass destruction, A.D.Sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wideproduction and testing, and stubbornly placed before the governmentthe question of limiting such test, it said.But at that time his appeal were not accepted, it said.He kept these same position in the future.The visit by human right activist Andrei D.Sakharov to the United States ha gone virtually unreported by statemedia, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced oppositionto the US. Star Wars program.That report from Radio Moscow, carried on itsinternational-service news program Tuesday, apparently wa the onlymention made by Soviet medium of Sakharov's visit to the UnitedStates, which began Sunday.Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the comment about the Reaganadministration's space-based anti-missile program at a Boston newsconference.Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, is scheduled tospend two week visiting relative in the United States, undergoingmedical test and promoting a new international organization hebelongs to.A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissidentmovement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven year in internalexile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive intoAfghanistan.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow inDecember 1986. Some statement and article by Sakharov have beenprinted in the Soviet medium since then, including an article lastweek in a magazine that opposed some element of Gorbachev'sblueprint for political and electoral reforms.Other activity by Sakharov have gone unreported here, includinghis delivery to Gorbachev of a list of 200 Soviets reportedly heldin prison, labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of theirpolitical views.The official Tass news agency reported Wednesday that theorganization Sakharov belongs to the International Foundation forthe Survival and Development of Humanity held it first session inBoston the previous day.Tass made no mention of Sakharov in it three-paragragh report,but said the Soviet delegation to the meeting wa headed by YevgenyVelikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

Theworkers are also calling for higher wage and better workingconditions, and are requesting two lawyer and two economist toassist them in the negotiations.Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region ofSilesia to experience unrest.Workers at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw stageda protest rally Monday to demand improved safety condition and thereturn of Solidarity activist to work.

The strike continued at these mine on 28 June. Some of the miner at the Karl Marx, ""Chernovonyy Zhovten,"" ""Chervonyy Profinter,"" and ""Yunkom"" pit joined the strike. A total of 1,200 of the association's 2,248 worker are on strike. A rally consisting of 350 miner wa held on 28 June near the town council building where demand were made to pay the wage and dismiss the director general of the ""Ordzhonikidzevuhillya"" production association.A strike committee consisting of 12 person wa elected (one of the member is a former Komsomol leader and former USSR people's deputy Viktor Honcharov) and it wa decided to continue the strike until the demand that had been raised have been completely fulfilled.On 28 June, 118 of 258 worker on the second shift at the ""PivdennoDonbass"" mine of the ""Donetskvuhillya"" production association in the town of Ugledar refused to start work for the same reason -- delay in paying wage. After a meeting with the mine's director, who promised to pay the arrears, the miner on the third shift returned to work.On 27 June, all miner on the fourth shift at the ""Karbomid"" and ""Pervomaysk"" mine in Pervomaysk, Lugansk oblast, refused to start work (142 and 157 miner respectively).In the opinion of the mine's representative, who wished not to be identified, the strike ha a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the existing authority and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential election. According to some report, among the leader of the striking pit there are member of the Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Bloc of Reforms.As Kostyantyn Fesenko, chairman of the coal industry worker trade union, informed a UNIAN correspondent, Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, in a telephone conversation on 29 June, gave assurance that the money for the miners' wage a well a subsidy for the following month would be found and forwarded in the next few days.The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miner in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wage and better working condition, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation. The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africa's gold mine and about one-fifth of it coal mine, said Cyril Ramaphosa, the union's general secretary. If worker in mine not included in current negotiation join in sympathy strike, a total of 300,000 miner could be on strike, he said. Gold and coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign-currency earnings. The union's announcement produced little immediate reaction on South African financial market, where analyst said a strike had been expected and probably wouldn't have much impact unless it lasted more than a month. Mine owner reportedly have been building stockpile for several week in anticipation of a strike. Mining companies' share rose along with the price of gold, but the metal's rise came mainly in reaction to increased tension in the Persian Gulf. The South African rand wa slightly firmer. Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding a 30%, across-the-board wage increase for black miner, who the union say earn an average of 225 rand ($109) a month. The Chamber of Mines, which represents the nation's six biggest mining house, say black miner earn about twice that much. It implemented wage increase ranging from 15% to 23.4% last month. Anglo American Corp., the huge South African mining house, warned against a strike, saying miner had received a good wage increase in July and wouldn't gain further raise by a job action. But ""at this stage it seems the strike seems inevitable,"" said Mr. Ramaphosa, who added that there hadn't been any negotiation with management since a strike ballot received ""overwhelming support"" during the week of July 12. He also warned of possible confrontation with police, saying: ""We have issued instruction to our member that if they are attacked they should defend themselves."" Miners' strike in recent year have featured clash with police, leaving dozen of people dead. ""The total mine that will be affected are 28 gold mine around the country and 18 collieries,"" the union official said. ""Our union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other company, where strike action could take place at any time, should the various mine management refuse to accede to our members' demands."" He said such other company included De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's largest diamond miner. In addition to the general wage increase, Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding pay for black miner doing dangerous work. The black miner also are asking for 30 days' leave each year, and a paid holiday on June 16, the anniversary of the 1976 Soweto riot. They also want an increase in death benefit to five year from two.Strikes by ten of thousand ofminers in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of theSoviet Union's coal field, Tass reported today.The official news agency said coal miner in Vorkuta in the farnorth, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and theUkrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out Wednesday.Miners in the Karaganda region in Soviet Central Asia todayrefused to work, Tass said. By evening, 14 mine in the region, homeof the country's third-largest coal field, were reported at astandstill.Tass said their demand were similar to those of striking minersin the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basin, who are seeking greaterlocal control over their industry and better wage and livingconditions.Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, arethe country's two leading coal basin and the strike amount to thecountry's worst labor unrest since the 1920s. Novokuznetsk is amajor city in the Kuznetsk region, where the strike began 10 daysago.The government ha acknowledged that living and workingconditions for miner in the region are abysmal and ha madegeneral pledge of improvements.Tass reported Wednesday that some miner in Siberia had returnedto work after the government made pay concessions.The government also ha promised to send extra meat, buttersugar, tea, leather shoe, furniture and car to relieve shortagesin the region, the Communist Youth League newspaper KomsomolskayaPravda said today.But the newspaper and Tass reported more disturbance in theUkraine. Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a communist official in theDonetsk city of Makeyevka a saying, The scale of the strike isgrowing. Practically all the coal enterprise of the city havestopped work.Miners in Vorkuta, Rostov and Dnepropetrovsk all walked off thejob on Wednesday, Tass said.In Vorkuta, striker sent a letter to the Kremlin asking for anurgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problem of thecoal sector, and also specific problem of worker of the farnorth, Tass said.In Rostov, miners' economic demand included extra pay forevening and night shift, longer vacation and an increase in theprice of coal to world market price, the news agency reported.In Dnepropetrovsk, which is 150 mile from Donetsk, workers'demands mirrored those of Donetsk and Kuznetsk miners.In Karaganda, striker said they walked out to protest incompletenews account of miners' demand in the Kuznetsk strike, accordingto Tass.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the strike couldimperil his reform and that there were report of railway workersbeing urged to strike.He said that if labor trouble spread, We may have to take suchextreme measure that it will hurt what we've been doing tooverhaul the economy through greater attention to free-marketmechanisms.He did not elaborate.Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were ended by forcebefore Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.Tass today said that the Kuznetsk strike had reached a turningpoint, with nine out of 11 mining center back at work.It wa not known how many more employee were back on the jobtoday. On Wednesday, Tass said that 24,000 striker in Kuznetsk wereback at work and 150,000 remained on strike.State television said Wednesday that the strike in the Donetskbasin had spread to 70 of it 120 mine, more than triple theprevious number, and that mine construction worker had joined.In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, television saidsteel and coke-chemical plant were on the verge of a stoppagefor lack of coal.Earlier report in the official press had said operation atsteel and power plant were affected by short supply of coal andcoke.Gorbachev told the national legislature Wednesday that thestrikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million ton of coal.The government ha agreed to most miner demand, including thoseon pension and overtime, Gorbachev said. But he said that settlingsome longer-term issue would take up to a month.Tass outlined a concession package that includes bonus pay tonight shift and for men using jackhammers.Strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortage ofconsumer good and food, and the government ha made general pledgesof improvement in those areas.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today thatthousands of striking coal miner and other worker are urgingrailway employee to join the work stoppage and that the unrestthreatens his economic reforms.Strikes have shut down more than 200 mine and factory in thecountry's two top coal-producing region, official report said. Ina report to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev said they have resulted ina 1 million-ton drop in coal production.Following Gorbachev to the podium, legislator Anatoly Saunin saideach lost work day cost million of ruble that might otherwise helpimprove living condition. You mustn't hold a knife to thethroat of the government, he told strikers.Saunin, from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine, the country's topcoal region, said the number of striking mine there increased from20 on Tuesday to 58 today.Now there are report of call to railroad worker to join thestrike a of Aug. 1, Gorbachev said during the parliamentarysession, which wa broadcast on television and radio.Such a development of event pose a threat to theimplementation of plan projected by the policy of perestroika, hesaid, referring to his effort to restructure the economy.Miners began walking out July 11 in Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin coalregion. Workers in other industry in the region soon followed. OnSaturday, miner in the Donetsk coal basin began walking off the job.The miner are demanding more local control over their industryas well a higher wage and better living conditions.Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegramto miner in the Ukraine assuring them that any concession grantedto Siberian miner would apply to other mining region a well.He blamed some of the miners' discontent on anti-socialistelements but said he understood their basic demands.Government negotiation with strike committee have resolved mostof the miners' demand, including those on pension and overtime,but some longer-term question will take up to a month to settle,and the miner are refusing any delay, he said.Central authority have so far balked at granting miner morecontrol over their industry.If the strike spread to other sector of the economy, We mayhave to take such extreme measure that it will hurt what we've beendoing, Gorbachev said, without specifying what step he would take.He said the lost coal production could not be recovered byincreasing the mines' output because they already work at fullcapacity.Recent report have put the total number of striker in theDonetsk and Kuznetsk region at more than 112000, but the numberappeared to be rising.Because of disrupted coal delivery, the strike threatened acatastrophe at metallurgical and electrical power plant, Tasssaid.The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member ofthe ruling Communist Party body who worked several year in thetractor-building industry and ha spoken about labor discipline.He held marathon meeting with striker Monday night and Tuesdayand addressed 30,000 people in the main square of Prokopyevsk, 2,100miles east of Moscow.Miners in the Donetsk Basin are demanding a 40 percent wageincrease for night work, improved living condition, a fixed day offand retirement after 20 year of underground work.They also demand that the Coal Mining Ministry trim itsmanagerial staff.Tass carried a report Tuesday denying that the Soviet Union'sthird major coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, also wa on strike.A proposed law on ending strike and other labor conflict isbeing rushed through the Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass said.A spokesman for the strike committee in Prokopyevsk, ValeryLegachev, said Tuesday that Slyunkov promised to increase thearea's regular food supply by 20 to 30 percent, a well a soapand washing powder.Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported Tuesday thatSlyunkov promised higher pay for night work, longer vacation and adoubling of the wholesale price of coal to pay for the benefits.The strike are believed to be the nation's worst since the1920s, when the country wa gripped in revolution, civil war and apower struggle. Records from that period are sketchy, but fightingwas widespread and industrial production wa severely disrupted.Until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the official medium did notreport job action in the Soviet Union. Underground reportsdescribed strike that were of much shorter and not a widespread asthose in Kuznetsk and Donetsk.Most of the country's 1.2 million coal miner are still working, but outputin some key region ha been halved, saddling Gorbachev with a substantiallabor and fuel problem even a he struggle to revive the Soviet economy.;The strike is the new union's first major test of strength. It began March 1as a warning action in the Karaganda coal field of Kazakhstan and theKrasnoarmeisk area of the Ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country'smajor coal regions.; The striker are seeking wage increase of at least100 percent, better working condition and earlier retirement. They claim thegovernment ha not kept promise it made to raise miners' living standard assettlement of a nationwide coal strike in July 1989.; The 1989 strike,which involved more than 500,000 miner, made only economic demand. Thistime, Shushpanov said, the miner also want three major politicalconcessions.; First, he said, they want ""real sovereignty"" for the 15Soviet republic. They are unhappy with Gorbachev's proposed Union Treaty,which would leave the central government in control of the economy, defense,foreign policy and communication, he said.; Second, the union is demandingmore power for Gorbachev's Federation Council, which includes the presidentsof all the republics.; Finally, the union want a ""law on property"" thatwould define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership ofland and industry, including some mine, he said.; According to the statenews agency Tass, the strike ha spread to the Donetsk coal basin of theUkraine, the Vorkuta and Inta region of northern Russia, and the Kuznetskcoal basin of western Siberia.WORKERS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterdayas coal mining union staged token stoppage in a third of the country'spits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies.The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unionsrepresenting some 40,0000 worker have been demanding a 30 per cent wageincrease, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wagesby 20 per cent. Further increase could only come if the government easedprohibitive wage control tax, thus providing a powerful precedent for wagedemands by other groups.Meanwhile coal mining union are also demanding wage increase a well a aclear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scatteredstoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pit wrung promise of wage rise thatcash strapped management can ill afford.In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coalmining is running at a loss with subsidy stopped in March a thegovernment moved to control the budget deficit. The industry is experiencinga coal glut with pit head, power station and export stock amounting to some12m tonne, the equivalent of a month's output.This ha led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' income and ledto the present bout of unrest. Polish mine produced 69.7m tonne of coal inthe first half of the year or 1.5 per cent le than in the same period lastyear. Meanwhile KGHM produced 197,000 tonne of refined copper in the sameperiod or 3.9 per cent more than in the first half of 1991.Coal miner in Siberia ended theirstrike today after exacting promise of better food, housing andworking condition, but the wave of unrest they launched continuedin other key coal regions.Some of the 150,000 miner who went on strike last week inSiberia's Kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work Thursday, andthe rest went back today, strike leader and the official Tass newsagency said.Despite announcement that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'ssweeping concession including granting miner greater controlover their industry apply nationwide, hundred of thousand ofminers stayed off the job elsewhere.In the largest coal region, the Donetsk Coal Basin of theUkraine, more than 300,000 miner were on strike, the deputyminister of the coal industry, Alexander P. Fisun, told Izvestia.In the Karaganda region of the southern republic of Kazakhstan,the Soviet Union's third-biggest coal-producing area, all 26 mineswere at a standstill, and miner made more than 70 demands,Izvestia said.Strikes were also reported in the Pechora Coal Basin in theRussian republic, and Chervonograd in the western Ukraine, officialmedia said.The labor unrest is the Soviet Union's worst in six decades.Gorbachev ha expressed sympathy for the striker and placedmuch of the blame for the miners' deteriorating working and livingconditions on leader of the officially sanctioned trade unions.Still, he and other Communist leader have warned that if thestrikes don't end quickly, coal shortage will shut down much ofthe country's industry.On Wednesday, the Kuznetsk strike committee and member of ahigh-level government commission signed an agreement meeting manydemands.The worker were promised higher wage, increased delivery ofmeat, sugar, soap, clothes, furniture and other consumer goods,more housing construction and most important a greater voice inrunning their industry.It's a victory over the system that we've had in the SovietUnion for the last 70 year, a system in which we work hard but getlittle in return, said Pyotr A. Menayev, an engineer at theTaldinski Severny open pit mine on the outskirt of Prokopyevsk.Strike committee member Vyacheslav G. Akulov stressed that theminers had agreed to interrupt the strike, not to end it.He said the miner would hold the government to it word: Ifthe government doesn't keep it promise, we will go back onstrike.The 26-member strike committee met today with a half-dozenrepresentatives to the national parliament and called for municipalelections to be advanced from the spring to the first half ofNovember.The last local election in Kuznetsk were held two year ago,before Gorbachev's reform made election more democratic byoffering multiple candidates.The strike wave began 11 day ago in Kuznetsk, the country'ssecond-largest coal field.Tass said late Thursday that strike had ended at six mine inthe Donetsk region but that most mine in the area remained onstrike.Miners at three shaft in Chervonograd, near the Polish border,joined the walkout Thursday night, said Anatoly M. Dotsenko, aspokesman for the Ukrainian Helsinki Watch Group.The coal industry employ more than 1 million workers.Tass today quoted Coal Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov a sayingthe government agreed to make all Soviet coal operationseconomically and legally independent.He said authority had agreed to additional payment for nightand evening shift and to give worker Sundays off.Beginning Aug. 1, mine and other industry in the coalmining complex will gain the right to sell for negotiated pricesin the USSR and abroad product which they make over and above thestate plan, Tass quoted the agreement a stipulating.It said local manager will be able to raise coal price toreflect actual production costs.Gorbachev is trying to end the longtime Soviet practice ofsetting price for good that bear no relation to their free-marketvalue and encourage and end to central control of the economy.Akulov said that beginning Jan. 1, the Kuznetzk coal basin willbecome economically autonomous.The Coal Mining Ministry will continue to run the mine, butthe miner will have a much greater say setting production levelsand allocating the profit, he said.Our politics have gotten freer under perestroika, Akulovsaid of Gorbachev's economic reform program. But our livingconditions have not improved.Until Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, strike were nottolerated.Thousands of miner in the northern Vorkuta regionare expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments,the Soviet news medium reported Friday.The miner are demanding the government fulfill promise ofimproved living and job conditions.Soviet official have said the strike could force fuelrationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament thatwould increase pension benefit by about 40 percent and upgradebenefits for coal miner, the official Tass news agency reported.The Komsomolskaya Pravda youth newspaper, in an article giving asympathetic view of the worker condition's in the Arctic Cirlecoal-mining district, said many miner do not see daylight formonths because of their underground work and the sun dip below thehorizon in the winter.A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that the latest round ofstrikes is illegal but did not impose any penalty. The miners'sunions said the decision will be appealed.Coal miner in the northern region and the Ukraine struck fortwo week this summer but returned to work in July after parliamentpassed a resolution promising reform, including improved socialand economic condition. The miner say the government ha renedgedon it promises.The news medium gave these account of the latest strikes:Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largestmine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighthday, according to Tass.Komsomolskaya Pravda said night-shift worker walked out atthree mine in Vorkuta and at another one the miner were stillworking but were preventing the coal from being shipped outside theregion.In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the nation's majorcoal-producing area, miner representative were discussing anotherstrike. Tens of thousand of miner walked off the job for twohours Wednesday.Tass said that in Donetsk the miner gathered in front of theHouse of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline forimplementing reforms.COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reformrampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike,pressing the government for higher wages.But so far the government, unlike it predecessor, ha not caved in. It hasinstead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered itssecond week, declared illegal.The miners' position seems untenable. Romanians appear solidly opposed tothe strike, angered by the miners' demand for an average wage of theequivalent of Dollars 290 a month. Most worker earn le than Dollars 80.Workers in the same trade union confederation a the miner have ignoredappeals by their leader to strike in solidarity.The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonne of pit coal produced eachyear in the Jiu Valley's 13 mine is not a vital source of energy. Theregion's coal supply two nearby power station but these plant, whichtogether account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity,could also be run using lignite and gas.The ministry further argues that the miner are in danger of pricing theircoal out of the market. According to the ministry, if the miners' paydemands were met, the cost of their coal would double. Even at presentprices, Ukrainian coal is being imported to the Romanian market.The strike seems motivated by a number of factor. The rank and file havecome out because they want more money to compensate for the difficultconditions in which they live and work.They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr MironCosma, the man who led them on protest to Bucharest and secured theirearlier wage increases.Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he hasthe support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are le obvious.The ministry of industry and finance are conducting investigation intocharges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH companyofficials. The company's chief accountant and budget director have alreadybeen fired, following earlier investigations.Ministry of Industry official argue the strike could be an attempt todivert attention from the investigations.Mr Cosma, however, appears confident. One of his bargaining tool is thethreat, albeit veiled, of fresh violence.In response to the question a to whether he intends to lead his men, whoappear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: 'Withminers, anything is possible.'But he is also making political threat. In recent month, Mr Cosma hasclaimed he ha evidence that senior government official, includingPresident Ion Iliescu, called miner to Bucharest a part of plan toconsolidate their own power.Mr Cosma appears increasingly willing to talk if his demand are not met. Itremains to be seen whether those involved in the incident of 1990 and 1991now feel confident enough to ignore him.Port worker in Szczecin andsouthwestern coal miner today declared sympathy strike withminers demanding the l ","AP880816-0135,AP890616-0230,FBIS4-42027,WSJ870804-0095,AP890720-0075,AP890719-0248,SJMN91-06069108,FT923-12122,AP890721-0091,AP891103-0200,FT933-9536,AP880817-0124",Coal miners strike in major coal regions around the world.,"Major strikes, mostly by coal miners seeking higher wages, seriously disrupted industries throughout the world from 1987 to 1994 in South Africa, Poland, Romania, the Ukraine, Siberia and Central Asia in the Soviet Union.

Navy official have said that the explosion in the No. 2 gunturret damaged only the turret.The top member of the Senate Armed Services Committee saidFriday the panel will hold hearing on the fiery explosion.The explosion occurred during open sea gun practice 300 milesnorth of Puerto Rico. The Pentagon said the blast ripped throughthe middle gun of the three-gun turret, and that that gun had notbeen fired prior to the explosion.The Pentagon ha ordered that no 16-inch gun will be fired untilthe investigation is complete. Ships with those gun thebattleships Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri and Wisconsin were builtduring World War II. Some critic have said the 16-inch gun areoutmoded and dangerous.The body of 47 sailor killed in the gunexplosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday asthe Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret toblow up.None of the gun in the no. 2 turret had been fired before theexplosion instantly killed the seaman, Navy official said. Theydiscarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by red-hotdebris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds.The Navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium onfiring 16-inch gun, found only on the Iowa and it three sisterbattleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.The Iowa wa headed back to it home port at Norfolk, Va., whilethe body of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at DoverAir Force Base in Delaware and family of the battleship's 1,600crewmen waited to learn whether their relative were among the dead.At the White House, chief of staff John Sununu announcedPresident Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for thevictims in Norfolk. He said the president had heard of the serviceand told his staff if it could be fitted in, he wanted to bethere . want to be a part.The blast occurred Wednesday morning northeast of Puerto Rico asthe Iowa took part in firing exercise that were part of navaltraining.A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet and the ship's former captainboth said the explosion in the No. 2 turret could have beentriggered by red-hot debris from earlier firing in the three-gunturret.But Cmdr. Mark Baker, chief of the Navy's Pentagon press office,said later that none of the turret's three gun had been fired.Only four round of 22 scheduled to be fired a part of atraining exercise had been fired, he said, and all had been fromthe No. 1 turret, forward of the one that exploded.No eyewitness survived Wednesday's explosion behind one of the16-inch gun on the Iowa, one of the largest warship ever.Pentagon official declined to speculate publicly about theexact cause of the disaster, the worst to strike a Navy ship since1977, but two officer Capt. Paul Hanley, a fleet spokesman, andCapt. Larry Seaquist, the ship's former captain said a possibleexplanation wa that red-hot debris from a previous round ignitednew charges.But Seaquist stressed, We simply do not know what caused thatpowder to go.Baker said no gun in the No. 2 turret had been fired and theorder had just been given to the No. 2 turret crew to load andprepare the center gun when the explosion occurred.We have no eyewitness to what actually transpired, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney told reporter a he headed back toWashington from a NATO meeting in Brussels.The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico tounload the body, which were then flown to Delaware. Navyinvestigators boarded the ship a it left for Norfolk, where it isexpected to arrive Sunday or Monday.Navy Secretary William Ball attended a memorial service at theDelaware base, home of the armed services' largest mortuary. Theflag-draped coffin were carried off a plane by Navy honor guards.Around the United States, Navy officer and chaplain broke thebad news to the dead men's next of kin.The job began just before midnight Wednesday, when official inNorfolk received the list of the dead.I've done it many time and I'll never get used to it, saidCmdr. Doug Palmer, acting chaplain for the Norfolk Navy Base. Fivemen had family in the Norfolk area.The commander of the US. 2nd Fleet, Adm. Jerome Johnson, whowas on board the Iowa, told reporter in Puerto Rico, The fireand explosion wa instantaneous.Cheney indicated the casualty were all in the swiveling gunhouse at the top of the turret, rather than the mechanicalcompartments and ammunition magazine below it.Eleven men escaped from powder magazine deep within the ship atthe base of the turret. A dozen crew member suffered minorinjuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion. They weretreated and returned to duty, said Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman.At the White House, President Bush brushed aside suggestionsthat the explosion wa due to the age of the Iowa, a World War IIleviathan brought out of mothball during the military buildup ofthe Reagan administration.Asked about the ship's safety, Bush said he wanted to insurethat procedure were checked to be sure that safety is at thehighest point . but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion thatbecause that kind of powder wa put into these turret in that waythat make a useful platform obsoleteAdm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey,began the board of inquiry's investigation. Hoffman said he couldnot predict when the investigation would be completed.Seaquist told reporter, It seems from the report that thosepowders exploded. He referred to the six 110-pound sack ofpowder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-poundshell.Seaquist said a pressurized air system that clear debris fromthe breech at a gun's rear must be operated manually. Each gun hasa one-inch diameter tube carrying air under 3,000 pound ofpressure to blow debris from the 62-foot barrel.The only officer killed wa Lt. jg. Phillip Edward Buch fromLas Cruces, N.M., who would normally be in a small compartment atthe rear of the swivelling top of the turret, adjacent to the roomin which shell are loaded.Naval officer familiar with the Iowa said an explosion canoccur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that cooksoff ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel orsmoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round.The first thing that come to mind is something like acook-off, said Hanley. It could have been a bag or aprojectile. We just don't know yet.None of the four battleship of the Iowa class, which sawservice in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam war, ha eversustained such an explosion, Pentagon official said.Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for theNavy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailor died whena launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton wasstruck by a Spanish freighter.Except for two World War II Japanese battleship and the currentNavy aircraft carrier, the 58,000-ton ship of the Iowa class arethe largest warship in the world.Investigators aboard the USS Iowa searched forclues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the life of47 sailor a the damaged battleship headed home and grief-strickenfamilies dealt with the loss of their loved ones.Officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worstdisaster to strike a Navy ship in more than a decade, a blast thatripped through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret during naval exercisesWednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico.Although naval gunnery expert combed the vessel Thursday, theirtask wa complicated by the absence of survivor from the swivelinggun housing where the explosion occurred. Eleven men escaped frompowder magazine located deep within the ship at the base of theturret.We have no eyewitness to what actually transpired, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney told reporter a he returned to Washingtonfrom a NATO meeting in Brussels.The Navy imposed a moratorium on firing 16-inch gun found onthe Iowa and it three sister battleship, the New Jersey, theWisconsin and the Missouri, pending an investigation of thedisasterAdm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey,began the board of inquiry's investigation, and Pentagon spokesmanFred Hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation wouldbe completed.As the Iowa headed toward it home port in Norfolk, Va., theflag-draped, metal coffin containing the body of the 47 seamenkilled arrived at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, site of thelargest military mortuary. Navy honor guard carried the coffinsoff a camouflaged C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.The body had been airlifted by helicopter from the Iowa whileit wa anchored offshore from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station inPuerto Rico, and placed on the cargo plane for the flight home.Across the nation, team of Navy officer and chaplain brokethe news to the sailors' next of kin.It's the greatest tragedy any of u can suffer, said RearAdm. Jimmy Pappas, the base commander in Norfolk. It's the mostdifficult thing you have to do to tell someone that a loved onehas been killed.Ernest Hanyecz Sr., of Bordentown, N.J., stayed up all nighttrying to get information about his 27-year-old son Ernest beforelearning Thursday that he wa among those killed.As long a they play their war game, there will be moredeaths and innocent people will die, said Hanyecz, whose sonjoined the Navy at the age of 17.The dead included one officer, Lt. jg. Phillip Edward Buch, 24,of Las Cruces, N.M., and 46 enlisted men. Most victim were singleand from 18 to 22 year old, said Navy official. A memorialservice will be held Monday on the Norfolk baseAdm. Jerome Johnson, the commander of the US. 2nd Fleet who wasaboard the Iowa, said the fire and explosion wa instantaneous.Navy official aboard the Iowa had scheduled firing 22 rounds.Four round were fired from the No. 1 turret and immediately afterthe commander had given the order to load and prepare the gun inthe No. 2 turret, the explosion occurredCapt. Larry Seaquist, a former captain of the Iowa, toldreporters earlier in the day, It seems from the report thatthose powder exploded. Six 110-pound sack of powder are rammedinto each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-pound shell.Naval officer familiar with the Iowa said an explosion canoccur if a gun breech is cracked, but Seaquist stressed, wesimply do not know what caused that powder to go.None of the four battleship of the Iowa class, which sawservice in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam war, hadpreviously experienced such an explosion, Pentagon official said.Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for theNavy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailor died whena launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton wasstruck by a Spanish freighter.Except for two World War II Japanese battleship and the currentNavy aircraft carrier, the 58,000-ton ship of the Iowa class arethe largest warship in the world.Hundreds of people gathered to honor the 47sailors who died on the USS Iowa a victim of a tragedy thatreaches into little town all over the country.Words are never sufficient at a time like this to express thefeelings that we share, Norfolk Mayor Joseph Leafe told the morethan 750 people who came to Friday's memorial at the ElizabethRiver waterfront.The 58,000-ton battleship wa steaming toward it home port hereand wa to arrive Sunday. Meanwhile, Navy investigator on boardstudied an amateur videotape for clue into Wednesday's explosionin the ship's No. 2 gun turretLt. Cmdr. James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman, said the explosionoccurred a an Iowa officer wa making a videotape to record thefiring of the ship's big gun. Cudler said Navy official had notdecided whether to release the tape publicly.Crewmen in the upper chamber of the gun turret were killed bythe explosion and fire while sailor working several level belowsuffocated when the blast sucked out all the oxygen, according to areport in today's edition of The Washington PostMaj. Tom Johnston, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet inNorfolk, said he had no information on the cause of death.The explosion came after two of the three gun had been loadedand just after the crew had been given permission to load and firethe center gun, the newspaper said.After the fire wa extinguished, crewman worked quickly toremove the shell and powder from the other two gun, the newspapersaid.NBC News reported Friday that the exact cause of the explosionmay never be known because the devastation inside the turret wa socomplete.The top member of the Senate Armed Services Committee said thepanel will hold hearing on the fiery explosion. The Pentagon hasordered the 16-inch gun on all four World War II-era battleshipssilenced until the investigation is finished.Some critic have said the 16-inch gun are outmoded anddangerous.Jim Smith, 63, of Norfolk, said he attended the memorial becausehe considered the dead men his shipmates.I served aboard the battleship North Carolina in 1946. I knowabout those big gun . I know these thing can happen, hesaid. At time like this, everyone seems to pull together. Webecome one family.Joan Taplett, wife of a Navy commander, said she brought her3-year-old son so he would always remember the men who died.I'm from South Dakota. . When I heard that one of the menkilled wa from there, I had to come, she said. I guess I'mhere for his parent. Something like this touch all of u . Itreaches into little town all over the country, she said.David L. Hanson, a 23-year-old electrician's mate 3rd class fromBison, S.D., population 457, wa among those killed.A wreath of 47 yellow carnation wa cast into the river, aNorfolk police honor guard gave a 21-gun salute and a Navy buglerplayed tap at the 15-minute ceremony.On the USS Iowa, 47 young men died too soon . We willremember, and honor and grieve a a nation, Gov. Gerald L.Baliles said.The Navy is planning a ceremony for the crew and family membersMonday morning at Norfolk Naval Base, with President Bush scheduledto attend.Thousands of grieving friend and relativesof the fallen 47 crewman from the battleship USS Iowa gatheredquietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved one asbrothers in eternity.We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and infact, for the 11 who survived, the president told a packedmemorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station. They all were, inthe word of a poet, `the men behind the guns.'They came from Hidalgo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Tampa,Florida; Costa Mesa, California. They came to the Navy asstrangers, served the Navy a shipmate and friend, and left theNavy a brother in eternity. In the finest Navy tradition, theyserved proudly on a great battleship, the USS Iowa.The president, a World War II Navy pilot, said he wa proud torecommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battlestars in two wars.But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesdayin the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, he said, Fate ha written asorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship.The Iowa's commander, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, said the turret'screw wa the best gun crew on the ship, and called it chief Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson, NY. my No. 1 chief.Victims' relative and hundred of sailor and officer in dressblues were among the 6,000 people crowded into a hangar for theservice. A bouquet of red rose wa placed in front of the podium;behind were an American flag and the battleship's banner. Outside,another 2,000 people listened to the service on loudspeakers.As many a 500 Iowa crewman were unable to attend the servicebecause they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted toenter the hangar because of security measure to protect Bush.Many were angry they could not attend, said Machinist's MateDavid Finn, 38. It wa very important to them, Finn said.The service came a day after the World War II-era battleshipeased into it home port, it gun barrel scorched and it 1,500crewmen at the rail in white uniform and black armband in memoryof their dead shipmates.Moosally told the crowd of mourner that he remembered the menof turret No. 2.I remember their face a they toiled at their gun, sweatingan honest sweat that come from young men dedicated to a greatcause, he said.I remember a they talked among themselves, looking so muchlike sailor of the past, sharing the exuberance of the time andthe dream of the future, he said.They were the life, the spirit and the soul of our ship. ...They made the ultimate sacrifice for u. . The men of Turret Twowill be part of the spirit of the Iowa forever.Bush recounted seeing the Iowa off the coast of the Philippinesas a naval aviator in World War II, and the great sense ofconfidence the big ship lent to the fleet.Addressing the child of the victim, he said: You mustnever forget that your father wa America's pride.At the end of the service, while the Navy Hymn wa played,President and Mrs. Bush greeted and consoled the family of thelost men. After the 45-minute service, the family attended aprivate reception with Moosally.The Navy said 45 victims' family attended the service.At a press briefing following the reception, Moosally praisedthe hundred of men who fought the fire for their courage.God gave birth to 500 hero, the captain said. Fire on aship is the most terrifying fear . you have nowhere to run.Our extensive training paid off, he said. Besides thefirefighting crew, we had cook, engineer, deck seaman, Marinesall fighting to save the ship.Moosally said the blast occurred just a he wa turning to ViceAdm. Jerome Johnson, commander of the 2nd Fleet, to tell him towatch the No. 2 turret because it contained his best crew.This wa my best turret, Moosally said. He said turret chiefZiegler wa the most meticulous of men. He wa my No. 1 chief ofthe 84 chief aboard.Nobody in that turret did anything unless they werequalified, Moosally said.Moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters'questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired,saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary.All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly lastWednesday when the explosion ripped through it. At the time, theIowa wa conducting open sea gun exercise off Puerto Rico.The Navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing.Navy official have refused to speculate on the cause of theexplosionCmdr. John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapon officer, said the gunswere thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and Moosallysaid he had no hesitation about the guns' safety.I'll be in the turret for the first shot to go off, thecaptain said.One of the survivor, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt21, of Tampa, Fla., said that at first the men down in the powdermagazine in the lowest level of the turret didn't know anything waswrong.We were waiting for the gun to fire, and we weren't sure, hesaid. When the men discovered that no one wa answering theinterior turret communication link, Truitt ordered the powderreturned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated.The sailor found smoke everywhere a they climbed throughhatches and up ladder outside the turret toward the sea deck,Truitt recalled.My first thought wa that I'd better get to a lifeboatstation, because if the fire got to the magazine thing would bebad, he said.Navy investigator will be looking at allpossibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort todetermine what caused the explosion that killed 47 aboard thebattleship USS Iowa, official say.It could take month before the probe is completed and theresults released publicly, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Alan Dooleysaid Sunday.A seven-member team of investigator boarded the battleship aday after the explosion flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turreton Wednesday.They're looking at any evidence of human error or mechanicalerror, or anything technical, said Lt. Janet Mescus, aspokeswoman at the Navy's information center at Norfolk, Va., theship's home port. The Iowa returned to Norfolk on Sunday.They're moving a quickly a they can, Lt. Mescus said, butadded, They want to be thorough and that take time.Dooley said the investigation would be fairly complexbecause there were no witness. There were 11 survivor inside theturret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship'smagazines, the Navy said.Dooley said no information would be released until the probe iscompleted, and the Navy ha refused to speculate on the cause ofthe explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.But The New York Times reported Sunday that Navy team whoentered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile thatthe gun wa to have fired still there.The Times cited unidentified source a saying this indicatedthe explosion occurred while the bag containing 550 pound ofpropellant powder were still being loaded into the gun.Navy gunnery officer believe the explosion occurred when thebags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, thenewspaper said. They said flame and hot gas from the blast wentdown the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to theguns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.The Navy on Sunday released an amateur videotape of theexplosion, which wa made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowawho wanted to record the firing of the guns.The investigation team is headed by Rear Adm. Richard D.Milligan, former commanding officer of the battleship USS NewJersey, and it also includes expert on gunnery and weapons.The 16-inch gun on the USS Iowa, which can loba shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 mile, have an outdateddesign that is unfit in the nuclear missile age, critic say.They're old-fashioned and inherently dangerous. They all oughtto be eliminated, retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Centerfor Defense Information said Thursday. I don't know what more ittakes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is nolonger appropriate on warships.But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use onany ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailor Wednesday aboardthe battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for targetpractice.This gun . remains the finest naval gun in the world. It wasthe pinnacle of gun design art, and it is still a front-linesystem, said Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander of the Iowa untillast May.The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packedin silk bag to fire 16-inch-diameter shell from it 62-foot-longbarrel. It work like the breech-loaded gun that roared during theCivil War: A shell is placed into a barrel and then charged withgunpowder in a separate package.In the Iowa's case, 660 pound of powder six 110-pound bag is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2,700 pound at aspeed of 2,500 foot per second. An electric spark ignites thepowder.The extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during theburst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gas canbuild up in the barrel. Air pressurized to 3,000 pound per squareinch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guardagainst a blowback, which happens when powder ignites beforethe breech is closed.In newer gun, powder is packed in metal container. Missiles,the backbone of the modern Navy's attack capability, haveintegrated propellantsCapt. James Bush of the Center for Defense Information, aprivate think tank often critical of Pentagon policy, said the Iowaexplosion could have been caused by smoldering debris, a blowbackor a mishap in the handling of powder.It wasn't unexpected. It wasn't a surprise. This is dangeroustechnology. It's archaic, Bush said. These are the only gun inthe Navy that still used bagged powder.The Navy said Thursday that none of the gun in the Iowa turrethad been fired before the explosion took place.The Navy also on Thursday placed a moratorium on firing the bigguns, found only on the Iowa and it three sister battleship, theNew Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.In a larger sense, critic say the battleship themselves, oncethe mainstay of gunboat diplomacy, have outlived their purpose.Despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, the battlewagon arevulnerable to submarine and missile attack. The 20-mile range ofthe 16-inch gun is almost worthless in an era when missile can befired at much greater distances.We can do almost anything with a missile and do it better,Bush said.Battleships reached their heyday in World War I and wereintended to fight other ships.The Iowa, first launched in 1942, wa the first of an entireclass of US. battlewagon built to conquer Japan.It supported Marine amphibious landing and shelled shoretargets, but the aircraft carrier emerged a the Navy's top weaponbecause naval battle were waged without ship ever seeing eachother. The Iowa also fought off Korea.The Iowa and three sister warship were ordered out of mothballsin the Reagan administration's military buildup six year ago. Theywere upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missile, 20mm gun and Harpoonmissiles.One of the battleship, the New Jersey, bombarded Syrian andDruze position in Lebanon a part the US. peacekeeping role in1983. But the 16-inch gun often missed their target, which theNavy blamed on unreliable powder from World War II.There wa no military need to return these ship to activeduty, said the CDI's LaRocque. Their only military utility isto bombard Third World country, and the era of gunboat diplomacyis over.The scarred battleship USS Iowa made asomber return Sunday to it home port, where about 3,000 familymembers and friend of the crew welcomed loved one who escaped anexplosion that killed 47 sailors.Sailors in white with black arm band lined the rail a thehuge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m.,just one minute later than Navy official had estimated. Twentyminutes later, family started filing aboard the ship, exchangingtearful embrace with the returning sailors.They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to gethome, said Capt. Steven Karalekas.The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gunturret, which extends six deck down into the ship. There were 11survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powderfrom the ship's magazine, the Navy said.Two of the surviving crewman of No. 2 turret stood on top of thefire-blackened turret a the ship pulled into the pier, with fullcrews on the ship's two other turret, the Navy said.The No. 2 turret wa in the same position a when the explosionoccurred, facing right with the left and right gun elevated. Thecenter gun, where the blast occurred, wa depressed.When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scatteredcheers by those on the dock, but all remained silent a the shippulled into the pier. The somber mood wa heightened by the lack ofbands, and few wave were exchanged a the ship dockedAdm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet,was on the dock to greet the vessel. As it docked, three Marinesraised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.The Navy kept the news medium about 300 yard from the families,and reporter were not allowed to talk with the family or thecrewmen.The violence and power of the turret explosion wa shown in anamateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday. The tape wa madeby an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record thefiring of the big guns.The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-likerubber bloomer that seal the turret's gun slit, is followedby a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base ofthe gunhouse.The videotape cut immediately to damage control firefightersspraying heavy stream of water onto the turret.Throughout the Norfolk area, church dedicated prayer Sundaymorning to the family of Iowa crewmen.We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way, said Cmdr.John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk NavalAir Station. Our faith help u to handle what science cannotanswer, the mystery of death.A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a bookcontaining the name of the dead were taken to the altar.Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lostSoviet submarine put political difference aside and unite thehuman family a one.On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial servicein a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.The family of the victim were invited, but Navy officialssaid they did not know how many would attend. None of the victimslisted the Norfolk area a their hometown.The explosion occurred during exercise off Puerto Rico. ThePentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of thethree-gun turret had been fired.

35,d085d,"Here is a chronology of Hurricane Hugo's destructive path acrossthe Caribbean into South Carolina:Residents took forecaster at their wordwhen they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number ofdeaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthyrespect, authority said.The storm, which caused billion in damage, claimed 17 life inSouth Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, whichbore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.We just feel very thankful about that, said Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. Several thousand of people who were in the sheltersand the ten of thousand of people who evacuated inland werepotential victim of injury and death.Riley and other official credited resident with monitoring thehurricane a it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuationwarnings.The last big storm to hit South Carolina wa Hurricane David in1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.Since then several big storm have threatened but veered away,and official were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.We've had so many close call, said Gary Garnet, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service.But this storm wa very, very strong, he said. This timethey realized it.Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000residents in Charleston and the three surrounding county headedfor shelters.Tens of thousand more got into their car and headed upInterstate 26 toward Columbia.Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related death, credited people for heeding thewarnings.It wa bad, but it could have been a lot worse, he said.You've just got to say nice thing about the people.Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-wearyCharlestonians: late Saturday the tropic were quiet with no otherstorms brewing.There's nothing to worry about out there, he said.This historic city ha survived theravages of earthquake, battle and storm in it storied300-year-history, but it faced perhaps it greatest test of all inHurricane Hugo.The storm, packing wind of up to 135 mph, raged into CharlestonThursday night.This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the like of which fewpeople who have lived all their life in Charleston haveexperienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.Hugo wa the first major hurricane to strike Charleston sinceHurricane Gracie came ashore 70 mile to the south in 1959.The seaside community ha suffered through many disaster, bothnatural and man-made.The worst in recent decade wa in 1938 when a tornado torethrough the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundred and causingan estimated $2 million in property damage.Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structure liningquaint street and alleyway, is where the Civil War began in 1861.The city ha survived the shot and shell of two war and anynumber of smaller hurricane, politely referred to by Charlestoniansof refinement a September gales.But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on thehot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what somefolks thought wa a prelude to Judgement Day.The great Charleston earthquake wa felt a far away a Chicagoand New York City.Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, theearthquake claimed an estimated 110 life, destroyed 102 buildingsand tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimney into the streets.In recent year, the city ha attracted million of visitorsannually who tour it historic building and visit it nearby finesand beaches.Charleston ha received international acclaim a home to SpoletoFestival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike to refer to Spoleto a the world's most comprehensive artsfestival.Supercomputers, satellite and the expertise ofseveral hurricane forecaster predicted the destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to fleethe South Carolina coast.But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.All the world's knowledge about meteorological condition andforecasting change in those condition is embodied in thosemodels, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall wa difficult, butforecasters said Friday that the landfall wa predicted in time forevacuation.Overall, I think the tracking model gave u a very good ideawhere Hugo would be so official in South Carolina could act in atimely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.The real forecasting problem with Hugo wa predicting theintensity of the storm, which wa upgraded to a Category 4 hurricanejust hour before it slammed into Charleston.It is very difficult to predict change in intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer model for that, McAdie said.We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.The hurricane specialist were surprised by the last-minuteincrease in wind speed, which wa reported to them by Air Forcereconnaissance.Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who ha tracked hurricane for 35years, said that a couple of decade ago, the only forecasting toolswere report from aircraft or ships.We had no radar or satellite then, so needle to say ourforecasts were le accurate, Clark said.In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellite toobtain a global weather picture. Information from the satellite isused to improve the accuracy of the large-scale model thattelevision viewer see every night.Using the information from the satellite, supercomputer at theNational Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where a tracking model constantly change toaccount for current weather condition and the position of thehurricane.To determine the track of the storm, the forecaster analyzesupercomputer prediction, satellite data, the history of similarstorms and the current path of the hurricane.Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the MassachussettsInstitute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.Congress and the American people are suffering from thecollective delusion that our data problem have been solved bysatellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enoughinformation about the wind and temperature that affect ahurricane's path.Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanescomes from flying airplane into the hurricane, and they do a verygood job, Emmanuel said.Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite picture is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.We have to remember that those model used are only guidanceproducts, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of theforecaster to predict the storm's path.Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina withrenewed fury Thursday after thousand of coastal resident insoutheastern state grabbed what they could carry and fled inland onjammed highways.This is a disaster staring u right in the eye, Mayor JosephP. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston,where the hurricane downed power line, snapped tree and causedutility transformer to explode.All we can do now is pray and hope all the precaution we havetaken have been sufficient, Riley said a Hugo's eye bore in onthe city. I just hope and pray we can get through this without anyloss of life.By midnight, 119 mph wind were reported in Charleston. The roofcracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that haswithstood several hurricane, and torrent of water poured into thepaneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the commandpost wa knocked out.Hurricane-force wind first hit the coast by 9:15 pm. EDT, andabout three hour later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle ofPalms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of theNational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.The eye wa about 10 mile across and top wind were still at 135mph.Hugo wa expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severeflooding a it moved up the East Coast. The storm posed a 19 percentchance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hittingBoston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.As Hugo neared the coast, road from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,200 mile north, were nearly empty, a were the boarded-up resorttowns themselves. Power line and tree were downed in some spotsand water flooded road. Stop light and neon light were knockedout in Myrtle Beach.One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,' said AmyGarrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.In Charleston, the hurricane littered street with tin roofs,palmetto frond and chunk of bark. Businesses were closed andclasses at public school and university canceled. Riley orderedresidents of one-story home to evacuate.Hospitals stockpiled supply, discharging any patient wellenough to go and moving others to hospital inland to make room foremergency patient, official said.About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelter across the stateas of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220miles northwest of here.We tried to close the door but people are sneaking in sidedoors, said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at theConway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach. We tried to postguards at the door, but people were still coming in.American Red Cross relief effort were buckling under the numberof evacuee, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., whoappealed for help.Right now the Red Cross is sheltering ten of thousand ofpeople all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course is at the sametime that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and theother Caribbean islands.We're beginning to feel the squeeze. Our resource are verytight. Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest reliefoperations of the decade.At midnight, the center of Hugo wa near latitude 32.7 degreesnorth and longitude 79.9 degree west, forecaster said. Thehurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.Near it center, Hugo's muscle reached wind of 135 mph, up from125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North andSouth Carolina can expect tornado linked to Hugo for the next twodays, according to the hurricane center.The coastal area could expect hurricane force wind for 10 to 12hours once the eye come ashore, official said. A hurricane warningwas in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.By late afternoon, Hugo wa upgraded to a category 4 hurricane onthe Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,which indicated it could cause extreme damage.It strengthened more than we thought it would, Sheets said,adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding a it moved up theAppalachians.The timing of the landfall wa critical because of the storm'stidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 foot high that would feed anormal 5-foot high tide that peak after 2 a.m.On top of that will be wave, Sheets said earlier, and inmany place on barrier island the building will be swept cleanoff.Amid the uproar of live coverage by themajor network and score of other medium organization, NationalHurricane Center forecaster went about their business of monitoringHurricane Hugo.The whole system look chaotic, but it work, said BobSheets, the center's director.On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank ofmonitoring equipment were the forecaster, making meticulouscalculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike andgetting emergency operation going in those areas.On the other side were the medium a pack of reporter, cameraoperators and technician, jockeying for second of Sheets' time andtidbits of his expertise.In the center wa Sheets himself. Surrounded by camera, wiresand two dozen journalist with pad and telephone, the ubiquitousred-headed meteorologist ha appeared on television all week next toa large satellite monitor showing colorful image of Hurricane Hugo.During prime news time, competing technician and cameraman shoutand make rude hand gesture for people to get out of their shot ofSheets.At his back, casually dressed forecaster who have been working12-hour day tracked the storm via computer and satellites.We obviously don't like this and could probably do a betterjob, but everyone know now because of the medium, said hurricanespecialist Max Mayfield. In the Caribbean, we were not so certainthe word got out. But we know the Carolinas have been evacuated.When a hurricane warning go into effect, It's a $50 millionstatement, said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring to the cost ofemergency preparation and evacuation plan that must be implementedwhen the warning is posted.If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm wa outthere, he said. Before the hurricane warning system wasestablished, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousand oflives. But early today, after day of warning and proper evacuationprocedures, there were no immediate report of death despitewidespread damage in Charleston and other coastal area of SouthCarolina.I like to think that we make a difference a far a human livesare concerned, Cline said.After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecaster began towind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the lastseveral day. But, he warned, the hurricane center still isfollowing three other weather system that have moved into theAtlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm inthe Pacific.I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because peopleare getting clobbered to death, meteorologist Mark Zimmer said asthe storm pounded Charleston, SC. But we've done all we can.Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurer. New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net loss related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said AIG ha told them that it must cover the first $35 million of loss and that it reinsurance agreement will cover the bulk of the remaining damage. AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal region of the Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount take into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under it reinsurance contract, the company said. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on it earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimate that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cent and 65 cent a share on an after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said it State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimate claim payment from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster. When damage in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payment will exceed $500 million. It said that is more than three time the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.The greenhouse effect may breed bigger anddeadlier hurricane in the future, storm up to 50 percent strongerthan Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, somemeteorologists say.Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mphwinds this past week, killing at least 41 people.Just before Hugo struck the US. coast, it pressure wa measuredat 940 millibar. That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanesthis century to hit the United States, the National HurricaneCenter's Miles Lawrence said today.Gilbert, whose wind reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean lastyear, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage. It wa the mostpowerful hurricane ever recorded.Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane withcurrent ocean temperature, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorologydepartment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.But if the sea warm up, say by 3 to 6 degree Fahrenheit, thewind speed might be 25 percent higher which mean the destructiveforce would be more like 50 percent higher, he said.Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center forAtmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests thewarming trend is already here.Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a newbook Global Warming, said six of the 10 hottest year in thelast 100 occurred in the 1980s.He project that the 1990s will be even hotter.Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic water when itswinds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph a it passed over the GulfStream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.You'll get worse hurricane if the Caribbean is warmer, hesaid. And I think there are better-than-even odds that you willhave stronger hurricanes.Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climb, moderate hurricanesof the future could grow to Gilbert's strength and future Gilbertswill be even stronger.Gilbert wa so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the nationalhurricane center, said forecaster may have to use an intensityscale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with fivethe highest.The computer model Schneider us show that in a worst-casescenario, over the next 100 year the world's temperature could jumpby 10 degree if carbon dioxide and methane gas which bothcontribute to the greenhouse effect continue to pour into theatmosphere unchecked.It is possible that even though the world a a whole heat up,the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler. But he said that isunlikley.That's not what the model are showing, Schneider said. Andthat's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.

It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo.

Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit.

Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing.

36,d090d,"President Corazon Aquino todayreversed a long-held policy and said she wa willing to negotiatecease-fires with Communist guerrilla and former soldier who havestaged coup attemptsMrs. Aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks,including her most outspoken critic, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile.Manila ha been rocked by almost daily explosion. Although noone ha claimed responsibility for the blast, the government hasblamed them on former soldier who have repeatedly tried to toppledMrs. Aquino in coup attempts.The Communist rebel have been waging a 21-year rebellion toestablish a Marxist state. The last cease-fire with them collapsedin early 1987Sen. Wigberto Tanada called for a truce between the governmentand the Communist rebel after a major earthquake in thePhilippines on July 16, but Mrs. Aquino rejected the proposal.On Tuesday, a pro-Aquino senator, Orlando Mercado, urged Mrs.Aquino to put aside difference with her political foe and beginto discus the nation's security problem and economic woes.Enrile said he wa willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, whofired him a defense minister after he wa implicated in a coupattempt in November 1986Mrs. Aquino said in a statement today that Mercado and Enrileare welcome to join discussion now being held by a committee ofCabinet members.Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos ha adamantly refused anycease-fire with the Communist guerrilla since November 1986 whenthe Aquino government negotiated with the rebel during a 60-daytruce.Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, ha been credited withcrushing six coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino.Communists have accused him of whipping up threat of anothercoup attempt against Mrs. Aquino so that the civilian leadershipwould become indebted to him. Ramos ha denied all allegations.The last cease-fire with the rebel collapsed in January 1987after troop fired on farmer demonstrating outside Mrs. Aquino'soffice for land reform.President Corazon Aquino said todayshe will not allow Ferdinand Marcos to come home to die and hergovernment will not permit the ousted president to be buried onPhilippine soil.Marcos' wife Imelda appealed today to Mrs. Aquino to open herheart and allow the former president to return. Marcos' lawyeralso asked the Philippine Supreme Court to order the return,pledging the ousted leader would cooperate with the Aquinoadministration.Marcos wa reported in critical condition today in a Honoluluhospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery. Hospitalofficials said the 71-year-old former Philippine leader wassuffering from renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure.In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Imelda had left thehospital to make a final appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husbandto die in his homelandMrs. Aquino's daughter, Maria Elena Cruz, said the president hadreceived no call from Mrs. Marcos. Mrs. Cruz serf a hermother's secretary.In a statement broadcast today by the pro-Marcos radio stationDZEC, Imelda said she wa trying to contact the presidential officeto make a last appeal to Madam Corazon Aquino to open her heartand let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.This is for reconciliation, this is what's best for thecountry, Imelda said. I'd like to ask our people to pray thatMarcos may continue to liveMrs. Aquino told reporter earlier that she wa sorry to hearthat Marcos' condition had deteriorated and I pray that he willbe able to recover.I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me forreconsideration, because a I have said in the past, much a Iagree that Mr. Marcos ha his right, I still have to consider alsothe right and interest of million of Filipinos, Mrs. Aquinosaid.I have already said in the past that we will not allow hisremains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plan toavoid any untoward incident, she addedMrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986 uprising thattoppled his administration and forced him into exile in Hawaii.Today, the Manila Stock Exchange's composite index fell to1,084.53 from Thursday's close of 1,10297. Traders said rumor ofMarcos' death triggered a selling wave shortly before noon.In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Mrs. Marcos plannedto make one last appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband toreturn home.Rafael Ileto, Mrs. Aquino's national security advisor, saidgranting such a request wa still an option but, I doubt verymuch that it will be one of the solutions.Ileto, who met with Mrs. Aquino for a half-hour today, saidMarcos no longer posed a threat to the nation but his followerscan cause disruption of normal functions.Ileto, a retired vice chief of staff and former DefenseMinister, said the 160,000-member armed force wa capable ofquelling any unrest by Marcos supporters.The resignation of the land reformsecretary raise doubt about President Corazon Aquino's commitmentto agrarian reform and dramatizes conflict in a governmentcriticized for lack of vision.The controversy climaxed Thursday with the resignation ofSecretary-designate Florencio Abad, 35, whose nomination wasopposed by the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party.Handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistenciesfor which Mrs. Aquino ha been criticized: lack of clearpriorities; tactical blundering; and the strong influence of herrelatives over national policy.It also reinforced the suspicion among liberal that for all herrhetoric, Mrs. Aquino doe not share the deep commitment to socialchange which they expected when she took power in the 1986 peoplepower uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos.The sincerity of Corazon Aquino is being seriouslyquestioned, wrote columnist Ninez Cacho-Olivares in thePhilippine Daily Inquirer. Land reform, the centerpiece programof her administration, is dead.Abad's trouble began in February when he tried unsuccessfullyto block the lease of government land in Cavite province to Japan'sMarubeni Corp., for an industrial park.Although the deal wa approved by the National DevelopmentCorp., Abad, a former congressman, said the land should bedistributed to peasant under the agrarian reform program.The Department of Trade and Industry said the Marubeni deal wascrucial to attracting much-needed foreign investment for thegovernment's industrialization program.But the Department of Agrarian Reform said if the Cavite landwas exempted, hundred of landlord would try to have theirproperty declared a a potential industrial site to avoid losingtitle.The presidential staff finally worked out a compromise underwhich farmer would be offered either land or a cash settlement.Abad reluctantly agreed to the formula under repeated order fromMrs. Aquino.Abad's firm stand, however, alarmed landowner in Congress, whofloated rumor in the press that the Agrarian Reform Department wasriddled with Communists.Lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to thepro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party blocked Abad'sconfirmation through eight hearing until he finally resigned.Despite the party's victory, poltical damage to it and Mrs.Aquino wa considerable. The Manila press transformed Abad into afolk hero, depicting him a the champion of the farmer againstpolitical baron of the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party,dubbed Landlord-Dominated Party.Worry not about Abad's destiny, Mrs. President, wrotecolumnist Carol Arguillas in The Manila Chronicle. Worry aboutyours and how you blew the last chance for liberal supportMrs. Aquino pledged publicly to work for Abad's confirmation,but her lobbying appeared ineffectual. Abad's strongest opponentsincluded politician who consistently support Mrs. Aquino, leadingto speculation she wa not disappointed when he departed.Abad's opponent included her younger brother, Rep. JosePeping Cojuangco, who wields considerable influence ingovernment.There is no way Cory Aquino will challenge Peping, said oneWestern diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymityMrs. Aquino come from a landlord family. She and her brothersand sister are partner in a 14,500-acre sugar plantation inTarlac province. Rather than break up the estate, they used a legaloption and created a profit-sharing plan for the tenants.The Abad controversy wa the latest in a series of blow to theagrarian reform program, once touted a the centerpiece of theadministration.Last year, Agrarian Reform Secretary Philip Juico resigned afterdisclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sum formarginal land.His successor, Miriam Defensor Santiago, wa repeatedly rejectedby the Commission on Appointments, only to be reappointed untilMrs. Aquino replaced her with Abad on Dec. 31.No reason for the change wa given. But Mrs. Santiago claim shedid not display sufficient public loyalty to Mrs. Aquino during acoup attempt in early December.Agrarian reform wa widely seen a a mean for breaking thepower of landlord family and uplifting the livelihood of millionsof peasant. The program wa advertised a essential in curbing the21-year-old rural-based Marxist insurgencyMrs. Aquino proclaimed a land reform program in 1987 but leftdetails to Congress.

37,d080a,"There wa plenty of blame to go around at theend of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestationtrial, but no one wa willing to accept it.In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey andhis mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52child molestation charge. The jury deadlocked on 13 other charges.Afterward, the district attorney who filed the case criticizedthe current district attorney. The current district attorney blamedhis predecessor and defense attorney. And some of the parent ofchildren who attended the school blamed everybody.The system is not going to protect child, said JackieMcGauley, a parent who belief her child had been molested butdidn't testify in the case. Life is not fair, said RobertCurry, whose son attended the McMartin school. I tell my childrenall the time . there is no such thing a fair.The district attorney who originally pursued the case said hewould not have done anything differently.Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissedaccusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 with thenews medium acting a eager accomplice to boost his publicprofile a he ran for district attorney.I wa a professional prosecutor for 16 year before this casewas brought, he said. To have people who know very little aboutprofessional or prosecutorial ethic, to criticize me personallythat I have some political motive is totally unjustified.Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeatedhim, current District Attorney Ira Reiner. Philibosian said Reinerhurt prosecutor's chance by dismissing charge against five of theoriginal seven defendant and criticizing the case in a 1986 60Minutes interview.But Reiner, calling his dismissal of charge for lack ofevidence the decision we're proud of, said the trial took solong because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system,delay tactic by defense attorney and a mess left behind byPhilibosian.This is a case I inherited, Reiner said.In interview, many juror said they believed some of thechildren were molested, but the prosecution never established thatthe defendant were responsible.Even if you accept that the child were molested, it didn'tnecessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,said juror Brenda Williams.Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestationcase denounced the technique of a child therapy center and apolice department letter that inflamed parent and ignited the case.Seven juror who spoke with reporter in a joint news conferenceafter acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartinBuckey, on 52 molestation charge Thursday said they felt somechildren who testified may have been molested but not at thefamily-run McMartin Pre-School.And they said some child may have merely repeated storiestold them by their parent and interviewer at Children's InstituteInternational.The private child therapy center, which specializes in abusedchildren, videotaped interview with child from the McMartinschool after report of molestation surfaced. Jurors saw the tapesin which interviewer used anatomically explicit puppet andleading question to elicit description of molestation fromchildren.Asked what led to acquittal, juror Brenda Williams focused onthe taped interview from the center juror call CII.The CII interview I could not accept them, Mrs. Williamssaid. I believe the child believe what they were saying wastrue. But at CII, I could not tell if the child were saying whatwas told to them (by interviewer) or if they were repeating whattheir parent had told them.If the CII tape had not been entered into evidence and I hadnot seen them, I could have believed the child a little more,'Mrs. Williams said.The CII tape did not help me. They gave me a lot ofreasonable doubt, agreed juror Julie Peters, 47, a supermarketmeat wrapper.The child were never allowed to say in their own word whathappened to them. All the question were leading. They never had achance to tell their story, said juror John Breese, 51, amedical technician and grandfather of five.I tried to believe the child, said juror Daryl Hutchins28, an oil company lease operator. But if the child wa socontaminated (by the interview) I couldn't.Equal criticism wa aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by theManhattan Beach Police Department to parent of McMartin schoolchildren. The letter alerted parent to a claim of molestation atthe school and to Buckey's arrest.The police letter should never have been sent, said jurorSally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker. It put the informationout there too early. The whole city knew.At that point, juror said, they felt parent had beenprogrammed to believe their child had been molested.One child said his parent told him that he wa molested evenbefore he went to CII, Mrs. Williams recalled.The panelist said they threw out entirely the most fantasticallegations, including some children's account of being molestedin a car wash. We just dismissed those, said Mrs. Williams.They said a series of medical slide shown to them lacked impactbecause they weren't sure what they were seeing in the photo ofchildren's genitals.Although they acquitted defendant of most charge, the jurorsdeadlocked on 13 count. Some said they were unsure whether Buckeywas a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to proveits molestation allegation against him beyond a reasonable doubt.Jurors said they didn't rule out that some child in the casewere molested but not by these defendants.Even if you accept that the child were molested, saidjuror Mark Bassett, the evidence didn't establish that they weremolested at the McMartin Pre-School.The panelist said they were aware of the trial's enormous tollon defendant a well a child and parents.I think everybody is a victim, said Ms. Peters. I don'tthink anybody came out of this case a winner. I think it's sadbecause everybody lost something. The defendant their life havebeen ruined. They lost their business, their reputation. It's sadMrs. Williams added, The child have to live with this. Theparents have to live with this. There's nothing I can say that willmake it better.As for themselves, the juror said their life were put onhold for nearly three year. Bassett lost his job a a researchcomputer scientist when his company folded. Mrs. Williams gotmarried. Breese said his wife died during the trial and he hassince remarried.It's been very hard, said Mrs. Williams, a telephone companyservice representative. There were day when I thought I couldn'tstand it anymore.I don't really know my job anymore, she said. It's goingto be hard getting back into the real world.The jury foreman and four other juror declined interviews.The McMartin Pre-school molestation case wasthe longest criminal trial in US. history. Here is a chronology ofthe case:Ray Will Die is scrawled inbig black letter on the faded green paint of the McMartinPre-School, testimony to the rage inflamed by the notoriouschild-molesting case.Former McMartin teacher Raymond Buckey and his mother, PeggyMcMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday of 52 charge of molestingstudents. Jurors were deadlocked on 13 other counts.Whatever happens on those charge, few in thisupper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb would disagree with the judgein the trial, William Pounders, who once said, The case haspoisoned everyone who had contact with it.Sue Brown, a receptionist at a medical office across the streetfrom the school, said she had two friend who were involved in thecase and had been convinced of the Buckeys' guilt.I think they got off scot-free, Brown said. I'm reallysick about it.Alan Lagunoff, whose son, now 10, testified against the Buckeys,stood in front of the run-down, long-closed nursery school andtalked about his disappointment.The defense did everything to prolong the case and theprosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the caseproperly, he said.A cold wind blasted leaf across the schoolyard a Lagunoffleaned on the rusted chain-link fence surrounding the dilapidatedL-shaped building.I'd like to see the school become a center for abusedchildren, he said. It should be put to some good use ratherthan tear it down.But another longtime Manhattan Beach resident disagreed.I'd like to see it torn down, said Brenda Platt. I'd liketo have no memory of this.Platt, who ha two child aged 1 and 3, said she ha seriousdoubts about placing them in a day-care center because of theMcMartin trial.I think (the McMartin case) is a disgrace to Manhattan Beachand society. It's totally upsetting, Platt said.Linda Geisert, another resident of the beach city, wa alsoupset.I'm greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite franklyin the juror, Geisert said.For all his disappointment, Lagunoff said he did not feel theprosecutors should retry the remaining 13 counts.It would be just more of the same circus, he said.We put so much faith and hope in our court, said RobertCanter, 74. And this is what we get frustration.A therapist defended her interview ofalleged victim in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial,despite criticism by several juror who said leading questionsundermined the prosecution's case.The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother,Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation count anddeadlocked on 13 other counts.Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundred ofMcMartin student, and suggested that the goal of therapy are atodds with the legal standard required for a successful criminalprosecution.What is in the interest of child is not always in theinterest of the legal system, she said.Evidence introduced by prosecutor in what became the longestand most expensive criminal trial in US. history includedvideotaped interview of the alleged victims.Many of the interview were conducted at an early stage of thesexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker anddirector of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's InstituteInternational.MacFarlane said Thursday she still belief child from theschool had been molested and that they had not fabricated theiraccounts of abuse.This agency would never have gone all the way through what wehave if we did not believe these child, she said.At least seven juror who attended a news conference agreed theevidence showed child had been molested. But the juror weresharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.The child were never allowed to say in their own word whathappened to them, said juror John Breese. All the questionswere leading.If the CII tape had not been entered into evidence and I hadnot seen them, I could have believed the child a little more,juror Brenda Williams said.But MacFarlane said that the interviewing technique were sound,noting that small child must be interviewed differently thanadults.I didn't put word into their mouth, she said. I tried toenable them to get over their fears.MacFarlane acknowledged that some procedure could have beendone differently, including conducting more interview over alonger period of time. She called the outcome of the case atragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to thesechildren.But the institute's executive director, Mary M. Emmons, saidsome good may come out of the case.It ha greatly increased the awareness about the issue ofchild sexual abuse and about the problem of prosecuting thesecases, she said.Thursday's acquittal in the McMartinPre-School molestation case outraged parent who said prosecutorsbotched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph ofjustice over hysteria and hype.Mother-and-son defendant Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and RaymondBuckey, 31, wept a the verdict were announced. Jurors found thepair innocent of 52 charge and couldn't reach a verdict on 13other count. Prosecutors must decide whether to try those chargesin a new trial.I just said, `I told you Ray,' Mrs. Buckey said. Asked ifher son wa surprised, she said. He had fear, definitely.Buckey avoided reporter and slipped out the courthouse with hislawyer.If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen toyou, too. If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be heretoday, she said.But several parent of former student at the school said theBuckeys won because the system lost.It wa never done properly, said parent Alan Lagunoff, whomoved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach. I haveto sit back and figure out what to do with my son. I fear thatbecause of this verdict, no child will be seen a a crediblewitness from now on.His son, now 10, attended the school for 1{ year but wasn't awitness at the trial.I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into thecourts. It will just be another six-year travesty, Lagunoff said.The system is not going to protect child, said JackieMcGauley, a parent who belief her child had been molested butdidn't testify in the case. I don't know what the message is thatthe jury wanted to get out. I'm anxious to hear that.Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey,suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted thecase for it entire six year, wa motivated by personal ambition.My concern primarily wa Lael Rubin, who is `anything goes' inorder to secure a conviction. . If you don't win, you don't getpromoted, he said.Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince thejury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges.Even if you accept that the child were molested, it didn'tnecessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,Ms. Williams told reporters.Raymond Buckey spent nearly five year in jail without bailduring the case, which defense attorney said wa the result ofcommunity hysteria sparked by bizarre allegation by the alcoholicmother of one child at the preschool.Some observer accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosianof using the spectacular charge to boost his failing re-electioncampaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now run the districtattorney's office.Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled thematter differently.Ira Reiner ha had that case for five year, and I am notgoing to take any public criticism directed at me. Let him respondto the criticism, said Philibosian, now in private law practice.Also criticized wa the decision by investigator to use aprivate child therapy group, Children's Institute International, toconduct the original interview with the child. Defenseattorneys maintained that question by the institute's researcherswere leading and prejudicial.Jurors agreed.We never got the children's story in their own word, saidjuror John Breese.Children's Institute official didn't immediately returntelephone call seeking comment.Originally, there were seven defendant, including RaymondBuckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, thefounder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother ofRaymond Buckey.Hundreds of allegation of child molestation were filed in thecase, which gained worldwide attention with it tale ofunderground tunnel at the school and Satanic rituals.The focus of the case shifted dramatically over the year asReiner reduced the number of charge and dropped five defendantsafter reviewing the case. The underground tunnel were never found.No proof wa ever produced of Satanic rituals.Reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long,expensive prosecution.It took far too long and cost far too much money to have whathas been called perfect justice. We need reform, Reiner said,adding that in trying to describe the case, Insane is the wordthat come to mind.The case wa the longest and the costliest in American judicialhistory, at 2{ year and $15 million. Superior Court Judge WilliamPounders said he did what he could to limit it length, cutting 50witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case.For parent and others, there wa more to ponder than legalquestions.Life is not fair. I tell my child all the time . there isno such thing a fair, said Robert Currie, whose son attendedMcMartin but didn't testify at the trial.It's really a travesty for a case to take this long, saidMs. Rubin, the prosecutor. ...Not only for the family, thechildren in this case, but also for the defendant a well.Jurors who have reached verdict on 52 countsin the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they aredeadlocked on the remaining 13 charge in the nation's longest,costliest criminal trial.Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from thejurors a they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearingfor Thursday to discus the deadlock and possibly opening the 52sealed verdicts.In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would dealwith the deadlocked count first, either declaring a mistrial onthose count and reading the sealed verdict, or sending the juryback to resume deliberation on the undecided counts.He said the verdict could also be read before sending the juryback. However, the judge noted that The attorney are hopeful allthe count will be resolved before we take any verdicts.Pounders said he would discus the matter with attorney beforequizzing juror on whether they want to deliberate further.The juror are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and hismother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent ofcharges they molested child at their family-owned McMartinPre-School in Manhattan Beach.The jury that spent 2{ year hearing evidence in the case haveagreed on 52 verdict. They have all been sealed. None of theverdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed bythe jury.Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberation. Buckey and hismother are charged with 64 count of child molestation and the oneshared count of conspiracy.One of the charge which apparently ha divided the juror isthe conspiracy charge which name both defendants.Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convictone defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemedperplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.After conferring with lawyer, Pounders told juror they couldconvict just one of the defendant on the charge if you feel thatthe defendant conspired with one or more other persons.However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight allegedovert act, some of them naming only one defendant. A splitverdict, he said, would require elimination of overt act allegedagainst a defendant acquitted of the charge.It wa at that point, he said, that some juror began shakingtheir head in confusion.Buckey and his mother were the only defendant required to standtrial after an 18-month preliminary hearing. Five woman teacherswho worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charge against themdismissed. Among those were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and hisgrandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the prestigious but nowdefunct nursery school.On Tuesday, deliberation were halted at midday because a jurorbecame ill. On Wednesday, the talk did not begin until 1 p.m.because another juror's child wa ill.No alternate remain in the case and the judge ha worried thatlosing one of the 12 remaining juror would force a mistrial.

40,d076b,"Former President Reagan thanked British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other alliesbacked down, heaping praise on his political soulmate a she headsoff into the sunset.Margaret Thatcher wa a completely reliable ally and partnerof the greatest personal integrity, Reagan said in a statementafter Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement.I could always count on her wise counsel, her firm support,and her loyal friendship, Reagan saidMrs. Thatcher on Thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted byMichael Heseltine, who resigned a her defense minister in 1986.Reagan and the prime minister dubbed the Iron Lady formed aformidable duo in the 1980s and made no secret of their mutualregard. They often stood side-by-side at international gatheringsand called each other Ronnie and Margaret.Two year ago, a they met for the final time before Reagan leftoffice, the president said he wa leaving the White House withconsiderable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcherwill still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.Reagan, who spent Thanksgiving with friend at his Bel-Air home,called her resignation in the face of strong opposition aselfless and courageous decision in what she belief is the bestinterests of her country.The former chief executive wa always grateful to Mrs.Thatcher's support of his conservative approach to foreign affairsduring his own eight-year tenure.In 1986, when the US. bombing of Libya wa criticized by worldpowers, Mrs. Thatcher wa the only ally who supported Reagan andallowed the bomber to fly from British bases.When Britain fought Argentina for the Falkland Islands, theUnited States wa forced to choose between two ally. Reagan sidedwith Mrs. Thatcher.She also encouraged Reagan's nurturing of the huge Pentagonbuildup, and backed US. effort to install medium-range missilesin Europe, despite opposition from NATO allies.Both leader adopted a hard line toward the Soviet Union, butwere quick to warm up to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev asthe Cold War thawed.Reagan credited Mrs. Thatcher's resoluteness for playing akey role in ending the tension between the Western democracy andthe Eastern Block.She stood up to the Soviets and let them know she meantbusiness, he said.Both were ardent advocate of the free market and privateenterprise.While the United States became mired in debt in the era ofReaganomics, the British economy thrived on Mrs. Thatcher's radicalpolicies during her nearly 12-year rule. Average earnings were upby nearly one-third and more Britons owned their home during hertenor.Like Reagan, however, Mrs. Thatcher wa accused by liberal ofwidening the gap between the rich and poor in her country, and bothclashed with organized labor.For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher wasregarded at the White House a America's best friend, the trustedally whose strong view reinforced the conservative tone ofadministration policies.Among Western ally, she wa alone at Ronald Reagan's side in1986 in supporting the US. bombing of Libya. In the Persian Gulfcrisis, she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troop to theMiddle East.You always know where she wa and what she believed, Bushsaid upon hearing of her decision to resign. She ha always beenan outstanding ally of the United States, he said. I will missher.There were many doubter around the world when Reagan arrived inWashington with an economic program of free-market capitalism thatseemed out of step with the time. Mrs. Thatcher wasn't one of theskeptics; she wa advocating a similar program at home.They shared rocky relation with organized labor. Reagansuccessfully fired the nation's air traffic controller, dealing adevastating blow to labor. She, too, smashed restive unions.On foreign policy, she frequently wa more right wing thanReagan - certainly more so than Bush.Reagan never made any secret of his special affection for theBritish prime minister. They were ideological soulmates and calledeach other Ronnie and Margaret. At international gathering, theyusually were side by side.Two year ago a they met for the final time before Reagan leftoffice, the president said he wa leaving the White House withconsiderable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcherwill still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.She later wrote him a Dear Ron letter in which she praisedhim a a great president, one of the greatest.Like Reagan, she wa deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union.Together they advocated a hard line toward Moscow and championedmilitary readiness - even though she wa the first to recognizeMikhail S. Gorbachev a a leader she could do business withMrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagannurtured under the theme of peace through strength. She wa a bigbacker of US. effort to install medium-range missile in Europeand always seemed cautious - perhaps reluctant - when it came todisarmament.When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the FalklandIslands, the United States wa forced to make a painful choicebetween two ally. Ronnie sided with Margaret.Washington's special relationship with London seemed to slipwhen Reagan left power. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher disagreed publiclylast year over her government's decision to deport Vietnamese andCambodian boat people who were fleeing their country to HongKong.Bush, a veteran of world politics, knew many leader around theglobe. Mrs. Thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang.The Berlin Wall wa collapsing and it appeared a if Bush foundGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs. Thatcher.She wa merely one in a parade of foreign dignitary who got theprized invitation to visit Bush at Camp David this year.Nevertheless, Bush said he expected the special relationshipbetween the United States and Great Britain to remain on a steadykeelMrs. Thatcher did her part, demonstrating her loyalty. Forawhile she and Bush were seemingly alone in their suspicion ofGorbachev's unilateral cutback in troop and arm in Europe, andappeared uncertain how to respond.Under intense pressure from Congress, Bush began to warm to theSoviet leader. Now they seem almost best of friends.On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possiblemilitary force, and ordered a huge buildup of troop to make histhreat credible. Mrs. Thatcher, characteristically, wa tougher.She said that unless Saddam Hussein got out of Kuwait soon, theWest would have to use military force to dislodge him.She called Saddam a loser, and the state-controlled Iraqinews agency replied that she wa an old hag.Now, she is leaving. No one suspect that Britain's newleadership - whoever it is - will take a soft line toward Iraq.Yet, if the going get tough, it might have been comforting forBush to be able to hear the tough old line from Thatcher.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's internationaladmirers praised her courage and achievement Thursday after sheannounced she would resign. Even her foe tempered scorn withpraise for a formidable adversary.Said President Bush, I will miss her.He called her an outstanding ally of the United Statesadding, You always knew where she wa and what she believed.Vitaly Ignatenko, spokesman for Soviet President MikhailGorbachev, told the independent Interfax news agency: Political,economic and cultural tie between our country have become ofgreater importance in the Thatcher era. Our relation . weremarked by constructivism and dialogue.The reluctance Mrs. Thatcher showed toward increasing Europeanunity wa the source of most criticism. But in a joyful andunambiguous response, Iraq saw the Persian Gulf crisis a cause ofher downfall.Bitterness wa undisguised in the comment from Argentina'sNicanor Costa Mendez, foreign minister during his country's 1982Falklands War with Britain.I can't say that it make me sad, he said. I believe thatthe extreme position - unnecessarily extreme, unjustifiablyextreme - of the prime minister were one of the cause of the war,and one of the biggest impediment to achieve agreement after.Socialist President Mario Soares of Portugal singled out hersystematic opposition to the advance of the European Community.During her long mandate, he said, the preoccupation ofsocial justice receded many time before purely developmentobjectives, causing a climate of discontent in British publicopinion to which Mrs. Thatcher appeared insensitive.But Soares also lauded the British prime minister a adetermined politician (who) took courageous position on criticaloccasions in international life and without doubt marked an era inthe contemporary history of her country.German Finance Minister Theo Waigel noted, Despite hercritical position on some question of European integration, sheaccomplished a great deal for European politics.A neutral letter from Socialist President Francois Mitterrand ofFrance told Mrs. Thatcher she had marked an important moment inthe history of your country and that of Europe.Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said growingopposition to her hard line against Iraq over it invasion ofKuwait buried Mrs. Thatcher just a the 1956 crisis overBritain's attack on the Suez Canal ruined former Prime MinisterAnthony Eden.Britain stepped in after Egypt nationalized the canal.On Thursday, Britain announced it wa nearly doubling it troopsdeployed in the gulf a part of the multinational force arrayedagainst Iraq, sending 14,000 more soldier to join the 16,000already in the region.South African President FW. de Klerk praised Mrs. Thatcher, whoopposed sanction on South Africa, for standing up to worldpressure and standing by Pretoria.She had faith in South Africa's ability to solve it problemsin a democratic way . She had the courage of her convictions,he said.Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel saidafter hearing ofher resignation that Israel feel a moment of sorrow because weall know this special personality, Mrs. Thatcher, who did manythings and wa an outstanding leader.Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said the British primeminister is a rare leader of firm conviction who wa invigoratedthe United Kingdom and I feel great regret that she ha withdrawnfrom the front line.Belgium's prime minister, Wilfried Martens, applauded thedetermining role she played during more than 10 year in her owncountry and on the international scene.Said Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia, Even those likemyself who have been at odds with Margaret Thatcher on particularissues have admired her courage and tenacity of purpose.Whatever the force arrayed against her, she wa alwaysprepared to pursue with the utmost vigor those position in whichshe believed.Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said, In the many year thatshe placed such an important stamp on the policy of the UnitedKingdom, Mrs. Thatcher ha shown that she doe not avoid makingdifficult decision that she deems to be in the nation's interest.This, too, is such a decision which deserves respect.Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, now alegislator in the European Parliament, said Mrs. Thatcher'sdecision to quit wa dignified and courageous.Margaret Thatcher will be seen with Winston Churchill a thegreatest British prime minister of the last 50 year. The curtainhas fallen on the Iron Lady. She deserves our congratulations.Even European Commission President Jacques Delors, Mrs.Thatcher's archenemy in Europe, spoke of his high esteem forher, despite their differences.Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader of Germany's governingChristian Democratic Union, said Mrs. Thatcher played a major rolein securing Western solidarity in the historical conflict forfreedom and democracy. We thank her for that.Former President Reagan spoke with great warmth of his closestforeign ally.Margaret Thatcher's resoluteness played a key role in endingthe Cold War, he said. She stood up to the Soviets and let themknow she meant business. Her deep and abiding dedication to theprinciples of liberty and democracy served a an inspiration tooppressed people everywhere who knew that Margaret Thatcher wouldnever waver in her belief that all men and woman are entitled tolive in freedom.Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a womancould achieve in British society, but her critic say she didlittle else to help woman along.For some, it wa enough that her political career reached theheights.One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatcher's successorwould hold, since he couldn't be called prime minister, that's agirl's name.Emma Nicholson, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it wa onceunthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister.She ha broken the mold once and forever, Ms. Nicholson said inan interviewMrs. Thatcher, who trained a a chemist before studying law,said she viewed herself a prime minister, not a a woman. Shebelieved the battle for women's right had been largely won and wasno believer in feminism.What ha it ever done for me? she once askedMrs. Thatcher, who stepped down on Thursday, urged woman to getinvolved in politics, but did little to pull them up the ladder.Several female lawmaker were appointed to junior executiveposts in various ministry, but the only woman to serve in aThatcher Cabinet wa Baroness Young, leader of the House of Lordsfrom 1981 to 1983.The truth is that although Mrs. Thatcher is a woman, shedoesn't believe in the advancement of woman, Clare Short, a LaborParty lawmaker, said last month.Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any otherprime minister would have had several woman in and out of theCabinet.It's Margaret's fault that the only people standing (tosucceed her) wear trouser, Mrs. Currie said last week. Trree menare vying to succeed her a Conservative Party leader and thusprime minister in a vote by party lawmaker set for Tuesday.Traditional male attitude remain strong in Britain, from theupper-crust, all-male club of London to the topless woman pictureddaily in the tabloid press.Women are paid le than men and are poorly represented inmanagement job and in Parliament.However, campaigner for woman right say there are encouragingsigns at the grassroots.The critical mass of woman have entered middle management ingovernment and business, said Lesley Abdela, a founding member ofthe 300 Group.The group seek equal representation for woman in the 650-seatHouse of Commons, which now ha 43 female members.Women represented 43 percent of the British labor force in 1988,compared with 40 percent in 1979 when Mrs. Thatcher became primeminister. Britain ha a higher proportion of working woman thanother European Community countries.Though Mrs. Thatcher never made a priority of women's issues,she did introduce some helpful legislation: tax concession forworkplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; andlegislation to compel absent father to pay child benefits.But a prime minister, she angered feminist by oftenemphasizing women's traditional role of homemaker andcare-givers.Angela Rumbold, the Conservative Party's minister for women'sissues, contends that an enormous amount ha been done forwomen during the Thatcher years.I'm not sure what she could have gone beyond promoting peoplewho were there just because they were woman, she said in aninterview. Margaret Thatcher is a great meritocrat. She believesin getting people to succeed on their merits.Jo Hawkins of the 300 Group, which is seeking equal number ofwomen in the House of Commons, belief Mrs. Thatcher'sextraordinary ability made it difficult for her to understand theneeds of the average woman.She would say that anybody can do it, just stick to yourprinciples and get up and do it, Ms. Hawkins said. I thinkbecause of her character, her personality and her amazingself-confidence, she isn't aware of how the normal personstruggles.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ha weakened herposition and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plansto step down after winning another term, opposition leader andpolitical observer said.A pro-Thatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated theobvious and that her statement were no cause for astonishmentMrs. Thatcher told The Sunday Correspondent in an interviewpublished Sunday that she hoped to lead her Conservative Party to afourth successive election but said it wa unlikely she would tryfor a fifth.I think people would think it wa time for someone else tocarry the torch, she told the newspaper.The Sunday Times of London said in a commentary: Mrs. Thatcherhas committed a colossal blunder.She ha given the rider for the Tory succession theirstarting order year in advance of the actual race, thenewspaper said.The next election must be held by the summer of 1992, but it isexpected Mrs. Thatcher will call it in 1991Mrs. Thatcher, who turned 64 last month, ha never previouslymade it clear in public when she plan to retire a party leader.She wa elected in 1979, the first female prime minister in Europe,and won re-election in 1983 and in 1987, when she said she plannedto go on and on.Earlier this year, Mrs. Thatcher overtook Liberal Lord Asquith's1908-1916 tenure a prime minister to become Britain's longestcontinuously serving prime minister of the 20th centuryMrs. Thatcher's popularity is the lowest of any prime ministersince opinion poll began in Britain 50 year ago, and seniorcolleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadershipstyle following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief,Nigel Lawson.Lord Callaghan, former Labor prime minister whom Mrs. Thatcherdefeated in 1979, said her comment had considerably weakened herposition.If her party win the next election, it is expected Mrs.Thatcher would step down before her term end to allow hersuccessor to choose a time to call a new election.My guess is that the Tory party will want someone a leaderwho could take them through the next Parliament, Callaghan said.If Mrs. Thatcher resigns while in office, her successor electedby the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval ofQueen Elizabeth II, but convention dictate that he or she seek amandate in a general election a soon a possible.The Sunday Times speculated she would step down by 1994. Mrs.Thatcher would celebrate her 69th birthday that year and herhusband, Denis, will be 79 and his age may have been a factor inher decision, the newspaper said.The newspaper predicted the opposition Labor Party will try topromote leader Neil Kinnock a the occupant-in-waiting of 10Downing St., who is ready, able and willing to complete a fullterm.Kinnock called Mrs. Thatcher's comment the interview ofsomeone preparing herself for quitting. Mentally, Margaret Thatcheris preparing herself for packing her bags.In an editorial today, the pro-Thatcher Daily Telegraph saidMrs. Thatcher wa merely stating the obvious by indicating shewould not seek a fifth term.Even were she not to fight a fifth election, Mrs. Thatchercould yet enjoy seven more year in charge, it said.By then she would be in her 70, and her devoted husband adecade older . Nonetheless, what other politician would beexpected to entertain an inquiry about his or her intention inseven year time? And can it really be a cause for astonishmentthat Mrs. Thatcher is unwilling to commit herself to politicalactivity in her mid-70s and beyond?

Gorbachev wa in town tocommemorate the country's 40th anniversary. The uprising wa aturning point that speeded Honecker's downfall 10 day later.Krenz, who had responsibility for many internal securityfunctions before Honecker's ouster, criticized the use of forceduring his testimony Wednesday.The excessive action of law enforcement authority wasneither politically nor morally justifiable, he told the panel,speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit.Krenz, who wa thrown out six week after succeeding Honecker onOct. 18, insisted he knew nothing about any order to shootdemonstrators. Numerous news medium account have said Honeckereither planned or issued such orders.Krenz said he accepted joint responsibility for misjudgingdissident citizen and dissident group for years.From today's viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there wasno general Politburo discussion about the negative developmentsthen taking place in society, said Krenz, an influentialPolitburo member even before Honecker's fall.Krenz added that he and other then-members of the Politburofailed to realize that the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churcheswere not working against but rather for the German DemocraticRepublic.Honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealisticperspectives, Krenz said of his one-time patron, who for yearstreated him like a son.Honecker ha been in ill health following gallbladder surgerylast summer. He wa recently operated on for a malignant kidneytumor.Krenz's current occupation ha not been publicized, followinghis fall a party chief on Dec. 3.Germany want to try him for ordering the shooting of people who attemptedto flee to the West during his year in power.

42,d075b,"The expensive practice of using ballooncatheters to force open heart artery immediately after heartattacks, now routinely done at many large hospital, is unnecessaryand should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.The study found that if heart attack victim quickly receiveclot-dissolving drug, they usually don't need the extra step of thecommon balloon procedure, known a angioplasty.Some expert said the result are good news, because they meanthat most heart attack patient can be treated in communityhospitals, where angioplasty is not available.The study also ha an important financial message. Its authorsestimated that if angioplasty wa widely adopted after heartattacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bill by $704million.This trial ha settled one of the most important question inmodern-day cardiology, commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of theUniversity of Washington, Seattle.The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial InfarctionTrial, or TIMI-II, directed by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Brigham andWomen's Hospital in Boston.The first phase of the study showed that giving people aclot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA,immediately after heart attack dramatically improved their chancesof survival.The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the AmericanHeart Association, wa intended to see whether people did betterstill if doctor tried to clear away any remaining blockage aftergiving TPA.At 50 hospital across the United States, doctor randomlyassigned 1,636 patient to get angioplasty within two day of theirheart attack if test showed there wa any chance they mightbenefit. Sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure,which temporarily inflates balloon in dangerously narrowed heartarteries to squeeze them open.A comparison group of 1,626 also got TPA. But they were notconsidered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain orabnormal exercise test during their recovery.After 42 day, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group haddied or suffered further heart attack, a did 10 percent of thosein the comparison group.A year after the treatment, there wa no difference in survival.About 93 percent of both group were still alive.There doe not appear to be any additional benefit fromangioplasty, Braunwald saidDr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented,We have the answer in this trial to a very important question ofhealth care delivery.While small hospital can give clot-dissolving drug to heartattack patient, most of them do not have the sophisticated labswhere angioplasty is performed.If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improvessurvival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty lab wouldneed to be established and more doctor trained to give theprocedure.The watch word is watchful waiting to see if patient needangioplasty. This ultimately make it possible for patient to betreated in community hospital and be transfered to terciary carecenters if angioplasty is needed, said Dr. Howard Morgan,immediate past president of the heart association.Heart attack occur when a clot block an artery that feed theheart muscle. The purpose of TPA and similar drug is to dissolvethese clot before the muscle dy. To be effective, the drug mustbe given within about four hour of the start of heart attacksymptoms.Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victimsare considered to be candidate for the drug. Many people delaygoing to the hospital until permanent damage occurs. In others, thetreatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgeryor a history of strokes.Balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people withclogged heart artery who have not suffered heart attack. Thelatest study did not question the usefulness of this kind ofangioplasty.Deaths from heart and blood vesseldisease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains byfar the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 second, theAmerican Heart Association said Sunday.The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in thedeath rate from the biggest killer of our population, said Dr.Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is presidentof the heart association.Those trend are dramatic and don't seem to be reversing, shesaid. The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go.The association released the statistic at it annual forum forscience writers.Experts attribute the decline in death rate to a combination ofhealthier living habit, including fewer cigarette and better food,and improved medical treatment.The public ought to appreciate the progress that ha been madein heart disease over the past 20 year, said Dr. Myron L.Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University. It's almost unbelievable.There is almost no form of heart disease that we can't approachwithout meaningful treatment.However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect of the heartassociation, also cautioned that much work remains, both inimproving care and encouraging people to take better care of theirhealth.I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemicheart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stopsmoking, get cholesterol treated if it's above 220, and identify andtreat hypertension, he said.Ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessel that feedthe heart. It underlies most heart attack, the single most lethalheart ailment.Association figure indicated that in 1986 the most recent yearfor which there are statistic an estimated 978,500 Americans diedfrom heart attack, stroke and other disease of the heart andblood vessel. Cancer, the No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.Between 1976 and 1986, the death rate from all form ofcardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It declined 28 percent forheart attack and 40 percent for strokes.The association's figure show that more than one in fourAmericans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almosthalf of those eventually die from it.About 60 percent of the heart attack death occur before thevictim reach the hospital. Studies show that about half of allheart attack victim wait more than two hour before getting to anemergency room.Weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to thehospital within three or four hour of the first sign of heartattacks. During this period, there is still time to give them drugsto dissolve the blood clot that are causing their heart attacks.This treatment can save life and reduce the disability of heartattacks.Other major goal, he said, include finding way to improve theeffectiveness of angioplasty, a technique that us balloon to openclogged heart artery, and finding surgical and medical techniquesto identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest.The heart association estimate that cardiovascular disease willcost $88.2 billion this year in medical expense and lost wages.Among other statistic released by the association:The most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure,which affect 60 million Americans.About 200,000 of the death from cardiovascular disease eachyear occur in people under age 65.There were 1,418 heart transplant in 1987, almost nine time asmany a in 1983.About 2.5 million Americans have angina, the chest painresulting from clogged heart artery. About 300,000 new case occurannually.As many a 1.5 million Americans will have heart attack thisyear.A drug that eas the heart's workload cancut the risk of new cardiac attack and death by 20 percent inpeople recovering from heart attack, according to a major studyreleased Thursday.The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil,known a a calcium channel blocker, wa effective for the 1{ yearsafter a heart attack. Calcium blocker are among several class ofmedicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.This is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blockermay be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction, or heartattack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.Several other study of calcium blocker, including one largeUS. study published last year, failed to find any benefit fromusing the medicine after heart attacks.According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about a effectiveas another variety of blood pressure medicine known a betablockers at protecting people after heart attacks.While calcium blocker may not replace beta blocker after heartattacks, the researcher said these drug still should have a rolein treatment.We feel it is important to have alternative. Many patient donot tolerate beta blocker, said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard ofCentral County Hospital in Hillerod, Denmark, a co-author of thestudy.Beta blocker are generally not recommended for people withasthma and emphysema. This mean the drug often cannot be given tocigarette smoker, who are frequent victim of heart attacks.In the study, conducted at 20 community hospital, doctorscompared 897 patient who got Verapamil after heart attack with878 people who took placebos.After 18 month of followup, there were 146 death or recurringheart attack among the Verapamil patient, compared with 180 inpeople who got the dummy medication.We wanted to see if an effect would be observed withVerapamil, said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen MunicipalHospital.If it had an effect, it should be seen in the first 12 to 18months, because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardialinfarction in this period, he said. Then it level off. That'swhat we demonstrated. It worked.The researcher believe that by reducing the amount of workneeded by the heart to sustain circulation, calcium blockerslowered the chance of ischemia, episode in which the heart's ownmuscle is deprived of oxygen.They said they were unsure why earlier study failed to showany benefit from calcium blocker after heart attack. However,they noted that some study enrolled patient who were also takingbeta blocker. And this might have obscured any benefit fromcalcium blockers.The result were presented at a meeting of the American Collegeof Cardiology. Among other research described at the meeting:Dr. James H. Chesebro of the Mayo Clinic said a five-year studyfound that aspirin doe not stop the continued buildup of existingblockages in the artery feeding the heart, although it maymodestly protect against the development of new deposit. However,like other study, this one found that aspirin signficantly cutthe risk of heart attacksDr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School said the nextphase of a large study of clot-dissolving drug will see whateffect they have in unstable angina. This is a condition in whichpeople suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by workor stress. Until now, the drug have been used only to treat heartattacks.An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterolof heart attack patient reduced their risk for another heartattack or death from heart disease, researcher said today.The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, ha one significantdrawback: It cause chronic diarrhea that persists for years.In the operation, doctor change the route of the smallintestine so about one-third of it is bypassed. This reduces theamount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.The $52 million, 17-year study wa conducted on people who hadalready suffered heart attack. The approach lengthened the livesof people who had very mild heart attack but not those with moresevere heart damage.During an average of 10 year of follow up, the death rate amongsurgery patient who had sustained minimal heart damage wa 24percent. In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percentDr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directedthe study, said the surgery should be considered along withcholesterol-lowering drug a a possible standard treatment.It ha a role in the management of patient with highcholesterol who have had a heart attack, Buchwald said. It iseminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, to patient with high cholesterol who have not hada heart attack.Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhatmore prone to have kidney stone, gallstone and intestinalobstructions.The study wa conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's NewEngland Journal of Medicine.Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubt remainabout whether it actually help people live longer if they alreadyhave healthy heart. Although the latest study wa conductedexclusively on people who had suffered heart attack, Buchwald saidhe belief the research should settle that question.It offer the strongest justification for marked lipid(cholesterol) ineervention that ha ever been offered, Buchwaldsaid. It is a very powerful study and should, except for certainpeople who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterolcontroversy.In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacksunderwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people weretreated with diet alone. At the start of the study, their averagecholesterol level were 251. The surgery lowered people'scholesterol 23 percent.The overall risk of dying from heart disease or sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack wa reduced 35 percent among thesurgical patient with the healthiest heart. The surgical patientsalso required le than half a many coronary bypass operationsbecause of clogged heart arteries.New treatment that stop a heart attack in itstracks may help victim to get out of the hospital more quicklythan ever before, perhaps even three day after their attack, astudy published today concludes.Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effect of sending a few carefully selected heart patient homeearly. They found that these people had no unusual complications,got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.It wa an extraordinarily safe strategy, said Dr. Eric J.Topol, the study's director. There were no problem with anyserious events.Topol said the early discharge were made possible by two recentmedical advance tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, andangioplasty.When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clotsin the heart's artery and minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar result by opening up the clogged artery withtiny balloons.The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trendof sending heart attack patient home from the hospital after evershorter stays.However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine saidmore research is needed before the finding are widely adopted.In the 1950s, doctor often recommended that patient stay inbed for one to two month after a heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in1955, he spent seven week recovering in the hospital.However, doctor learned that long inactivity did more harm thangood. Patients got out of shape, developed blood clot and becamedemoralized.In the 1960s, the stay wa shortened to three week and in the1970s to two week. Now, doctor typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalized seven to 10 days.In their paper, the doctor determined that 80 of the 507 heartattack patient studied were healthy enough to be considered forearly discharge. None of them had irregular heart beat, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill test showed no sign of heart attackdamage.Forty patient were sent home after three day, while the reststayed seven to 10 day. After six month of followup, none haddied, and the number of medical problem in both group wa similar.However, people in the early discharge group were able to returnto work about two week sooner than the others, and their medicalbills were significantly lower $12,546 versus $17,868.The researcher estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attackpatients were discharged after three day, the annual saving wouldbe at least $280 million.In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputyeditor of the journal, cautioned that the study wa not largeenough to spot complication that might result from reducinghospital stays.This single study, he wrote, is not sufficient to justifysweeping change in current management practice for all patientswho may at first appear to have uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin a a preventer of heart attack until more research support it value, the Food and Drug Administration said. Taking aspirin to prevent heart attack may increase some people's chance of dying of other thing, especially hemorrhagic stroke, the agency said in a commentary in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. The FDA persuaded aspirin maker in March to refrain from promoting aspirin a a preventer of first heart attack, at least for now. A study published in January indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal, first heart attack 47% in 11,000 male doctor over five year, compared with 11,000 who took a non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of blood platelet to help form clot. Heart attack usually occur when clot form in the artery nourishing the heart and choke off it blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risk for people who already have clotting problem, or for those who have high blood pressure, which put them at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke, the FDA commentary said. Strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the brain or by blood clots; hemorrhagic stroke are those caused by bleeding. The FDA commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic stroke recorded among the 11,000 subject taking aspirin in the recent study, compared with two such stroke among 11,000 subject taking the substitute. Overall death rate for the two group were the same, though the aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate wa much lower. There were 104 nonfatal heart attack among the aspirin user and 189 in the comparison group. ""Physicians, will, for a time, be forced to make their professional judgment about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information,"" said the FDA commentary, co-written by agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree with them completely,"" said Dr. Julie Buring, a Harvard University researcher who participated in the aspirin study. She added in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study is under way, and researcher expect to report to the FDA in late fall. The commentary noted a British study, also released in January, of 5,000 male physician that found that aspirin failed to protect against heart attack, and that it wa associated with a 2 1/2-fold increase in disabling strokes.A drug used to treat patient complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attack infour out of five heart patient, according to a study published intoday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem,increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patient whosehearts pump abnormally, expert said.Even so, the result may trigger an increase in the use of thedrug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctor said.The drug wa tested in 38 hospital in the United States andCanada on patient who had recently suffered a heart attack, saidDr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the Universityof Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.The result suggest the drug may be quite effective indecreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majorityof patient, Moss said. But the study also surprisingly suggeststhat patient who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be givendiltiazem because the drug increase the chance of a subsequentheart attack.We now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to,Moss said. That's what this study wa all about.Diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker, the newest class of drugsto be introduced in the fight against heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blocker are the other type commonly prescribed by doctors.The study involved 2,466 heart attack patient, who were giveneither 240 milligram of diltiazem a day or a placebo. Patientswere recruited from 1983 to 1986 and followed for 12 to 52 months.Overall, the drug only decreased additional heart attack 11percent, which wa not statistically significant, Moss said.But in patient who had normal or near-normal heart pumpfunction 1,909 patient or 80 percent of the total group diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25percent, Moss said.In patient whose heart had pumping problem, the drug not onlydidn't help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25percentDr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at StanfordUniversity, said he wa surprised that the drug increased thechance of heart attack in any group and that overall result werenot higher.But the bottom line is that this is the first study to showthat diltiazem can be effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean that more patient will be routinely put on this drug ona long-term basisDr. George Beller, a cardiologist and professor at theUniversity of Virginia, said he wa also somewhat surprised aboutthe increase in heart attack in the group suffering pulmonarycongestion.This is one of the first report that seems to identifythat, he said.Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blocker were introducedin the past decade, Beller said, and research into how effectivethey are in various application is in it early stages.Nitrates have been used for more than 50 year, and betablockers were developed in the 1960s.Aspirin sale jumped 41 percent for a few weeksearlier this year, not because of a rash of headaches.A study of more than 22,000 male doctor had shown that taking asingle aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half.The study wa one of a series of recent report showing for thefirst time that doctor are able not only to treat heart attack but also to prevent them.In the most recent report, doctor found that one aspirin tabletand a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hourscan dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.Without the treatment, patient had a 13 percent chance of dyingfrom a second heart attack within five week, the researchersfound. With the treatment, the figure dropped to 8 percent.The real discovery is that treatment for patient is going toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, say Richard Peto ofOxford University, one of the study's authors.Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death, by far.The National Center for Health Statistics report that 762,820Americans died of heart disease in 1987.To put it another way: Of the 2,127,000 American who died thatyear, more than one in three died of heart disease. (This doe notinclude those who died of blood-vessel disease, such a strokes.)The drug most responsible for the recent success in preventingheart attack are the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby,aspirin.The usual cause of heart attack is a blockage of the coronaryarteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. Theblockage arises from the buildup of fat, cholesterol and clottedblood.Clot-dissolvers break up clot, thus restoring blood flow.Aspirin interferes with aspect of the clotting process, helping toprevent clot formation in the first place.The limited sale of the clot-dissolving drug in the UnitedStates show that many doctor are still not using them, despitetheir proven success. But that is beginning to change.Some doctor predict that in the not-too-distant future thesedrugs will be judged so safe that they will be administeredroutinely by paramedic in ambulance before suspected heart attackvictims even reach the hospital.We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to havethe courage to use these drug in the absence of definitivediagnosis, say Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St.Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.The most important thing we can do is teach patient inadvance about the value of early treatment, he says.While most public attention ha focused on this new ability toprevent heart attack, researcher have also made importantprogress in speeding the recovery of patient who survive heartattacks.Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determinedthat some heart attack victim can be released from the hospital assoon a three day after their heart attack. Most heart attacksvictims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days.The patient given early discharge were able to return to worktwo week sooner than others in the study group. After six months,not one death wa recorded in the early-discharge group. Theresearchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacksvictims could be safely discharged after three days.In July, Stanford University doctor found that worker who wentback to their job about seven week after their heart attack didat least a well a worker who went back after a more typicalconvalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks.All of these advance come at a time when public health expertsare increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and goodnutrition in lowering heart disease risk.Early next year, the American Heart Association seal of approvalwill begin appearing on food that are low in fat and cholesteroland therefore can help reduce heart disease riskUS. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in July issued his firstreport on nutrition, calling on Americans to lower theirconsumption of fat and to eat more vegetable, fruit, fish,poultry and whole grains.The report ha been likened to the first Surgeon Generals reporton smoking, issued in 1964, which focused public attention onsmoking's hazard. Koop's recommendation largely echo those of theAmerican Heart Association, but they should help carry the messageto many more people.Progress in research on heart disease is making clear that theheart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strike withoutwarning and cannot be defended against.Much can be done to prevent heart attack, great improvementsare being made in treatment, and recovery is faster than everbefore.The use of a clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save25,000 life a year in the United States, doctor say.These result, say Dr. Peter Sleight of Oxford University,will change medical practice worldwide.A natural substance called transforming growthfactor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cellsfollowing a heart attack, according to a study published in thejournal Science.In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, agroup of laboratory rat induced to have heart attack suffered 50percent le cell damage after injection of transforming growthfactor beta than did rat that did not receive the TGF beta.TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guysfollowing a heart attack, said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor atJefferson.Lefer said his research team simulated heart attack in 24 ratsby partially blocking key artery in their hearts.In 12 of the rat, the researcher injected a placebo. In theother 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, the damagefrom the attack wa much le severe. There wa about 50 percentless injury with TGF beta than without it.The extent of heart cell damage wa determined by measuring theamount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack.Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, a in a heartattack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer. Thus, bymeasuring for the loss of this substance, researcher coulddetermine the amount of heart damage.Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of othersubstances, such a tumor necrosis factor, that can cause bloodvessels to narrow following a heart attack. Narrowed blood vesselscarry le oxygen-rich blood to cell and this cause additionalinjury following a heart attack.TGF beta is normally present in heart cell, but the studypublished in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cellsdamaged by a simulated heart attack.Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer saidhis research team used a substance produced artificially byGenentech, a California biotechnology firm.Lefer said his team is now conducting additional study withTGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attackvictims with the substance is at least a year away.Jefferson Medical College, where the study wa done, is part ofThomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.Science, which published the study, is the journal of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science.The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test,which measure the activity of a blood protein called renin,might suggest a new ""risk factor"" for heart attack. Abouthalf of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attackeach year don't have the known risk factor for heartdisease, such a high cholesterol level, cigarette smoking,obesity and high blood pressure. It is unknown whatdistinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those whodon't suffer heart attacks.The blood and urine test is already being done in manycommercial laboratory but for medical condition other thanheart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the CardiovascularCenter at Cornell University and New York Hospital. ""In ourhands, it cost about $40 and in other lab it may cost thepatient $40 to $80,"" he said. Dr. Laragh pioneered theresearch underlying use of the test, which wa developed byhis wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey. The test, which isn'tpatented, is available in kit form to laboratories.The blood portion of the test determines whether thekidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and howactive the chemical is. The release of renin is the firststep in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raise bloodpressure. The urine portion of the test tell how much saltis in the bloodstream. A high concentration of salt in theblood also raise pressure.The test is based on the fact that if the saltconcentration in the blood rise, tending to boost bloodpressure, the activity of the renin normally drop to offsetthe effect of the salt.The new experiment wa designed to test a theory put forthby Dr. Laragh and his colleague that the activity of therenin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack. Thetheory ha provoked sometimes furious controversy for almost20 years.The Cornell cardiologist ha argued that in many peoplewith high blood pressure the activity of the renin in theblood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of saltin the blood. Such ""high renin"" people are at a high risk ofa heart attack. On the other hand, in other patient withhigh blood pressure, the activity of the renin is much lowerthan is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood. These""low renin"" people are at a low risk of heart attack, Dr.Laragh ha maintained.In the experiment, blood and urine sample were obtainedat New York City office and factory from 1,717 worke ","AP881115-0113,AP890115-0014,AP900322-0112,AP901003-0006,AP880428-0041,WSJ880603-0129,AP880818-0088,AP880829-0222,AP900705-0149,WSJ910418-0105",,,,,New medical advances reduce the number of heart attacks nationwide.,"The chances of having a heart attack, the number one killer in the United States, have decreased significantly in the last decade. Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

Geological Survey placed theprobability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scaleat 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.The high probability is based on several factor, includinglength of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics atthe California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.This is not to say we predicted the earthquake. It just ha todo with the probability of an earthquake in this area, Allen said.He noted that the 1988 report, titled Probabilities of LargeEarthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,presented information that wa already widely known amongscientists. Allen said this information should have alertedofficials to take preventive steps.Frank Baldwin of US. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center saidthe quake's magnitude wa 6.9 on the Richter scale. It wa centeredin the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 mile south of San Francico.The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion a recorded onseismographs. A reading of 6 can cause severe damage. A quake of 7magnitude, a major earthquake, is capable of widespread heavydamage.Initial report indicated widespread damage from Tuesday'squake, especially affecting highway and old masonry buildings.It's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is acalamitous event. It's something we should therefore be readyfor, Allen said.The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind ofstructures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the LosAngeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of viewfrom this earthquake, he said. What will be important is to seehow the modern structure behaved.Allen said many of the same kind of older structure thatappeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in theLos Angeles region. In addition, some of the roadway andoverpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of constructionas the Bay Bridge.In some area of Southern California, there is a higherprobability of a major quake occurring. The highest, the USGS says,is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated SanFrancisco, many scientist have believed the next big one wouldstrike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.But study in recent year have reminded the Bay Area that italso faced another seismic disaster, and those study became areality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scalerocked the Bay area.A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the SanAndreas Fault that stretch 50 mile from Palo Alto southwardthrough the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.The quake wa centered on the San Andreas segment described inthe article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S.Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yetwhether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment.The epicenter of the quake wa about 8 mile northeast of SantaCruz and 75 mile south of San Francisco.The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professorChristopher Scholz, wa among several that produced conflictingestimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finallyhappened Tuesday.These study gave various interpretation of how much stressinside the Earth wa released by the great San Francisco earthquakeof 1906, which had a magnitude of about 8.3 and killed at least2,500 people.The bigger a quake, the more stress it relief, and thus thelonger it take for the same size quake to happen again.Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve asmuch stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains a other scientistsbelieved. That suggested a bigger quake might happen in the SanFrancisco Bay area sooner than some believed.Others disagreed. Faced with conflicting estimate, theGeological Survey issued a July 1988 report that it saidrepresented a consensus on the debate.The report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihoodof producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 year. It said thesouthernmost 20 mile of that segment had a 30 percent chance ofgenerating a magnitude-6.5 quake within 30 years.Tuesday's jolt wa centered within those southernmost 20 milesof the fault segment.Clearly, scientist had identified this segment a aparticularly hazardous one, Heaton said. There wa some debateabout the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake.The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed veryfew people in a region that wa then sparsely populated.Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fallvictim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report castdoubt on this assumption.Federal emergency official have estimated that the next bigone a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake could kill3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000people in the Bay Area.As bad a Tuesday's quake wa, it wa not a 1906 earthquake,Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming. Thequestion is when, Peck said.

The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist airin the center. If the atmospheric condition in general allow thiswarm chimney to build to very high level, 10-12 mile high, thenyou can have a severe hurricane.Category 4 storm cause extreme damage with wind from 131 to155 mph, surge of 13-18 foot and pressure of 27.17 to 2790.

Winds were clocked at 175 mph and the lowest pressure ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere was measured at its center.  Wednesday Gilbert slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds, severely damaging the resort areas in Cancun and Cozumel, severing electricity and communications over a wide area, and causing widespread flooding.

47,d071f,"Walk. Sit. Stay. Roll over. Go to court. Such is the life of one German short-haired pointer, a show dog bearing the name CH. Robin Crest Lorien Corniche. Cory, a he is called for short, isn't any run-of-the-litter critter. The ""CH."" in his name stand for champion. He ha won 245 show award a Best of Breed and 19 award a Best in Show. Basically, his problem come from serving more than one master. One of the dog's three owner think the kennel-club world ha seen enough of Cory, who is four year old. The other two owner think he ha plenty of prize still ahead. In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News). In the suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Mr. Attalla say, ""Cory ha achieved the pinnacle of success . . . and any further competition would only diminish what he ha accomplished."" Mr. Attalla claim that his work with Cory is no gravy train. In the suit, he say that under the owners' agreement he lay out fee and other expense for showing the animal and he decides when to show -- or to retire -- Cory. So far, Mr. Attalla say, he's spent over $125000, the amount sought in damage. In return, he is entitled to all ribbon and award. The Remondis are in charge of caring for the dog. Despite the retirement, the suit say, the Remondis showed Cory twice recently. (He placed fourth and then didn't place at all.) For now, a judge's order temporarily bar them from further show. In a memo filed in court, Mr. Remondi claim that Mr. Attalla retired the dog ""simply and solely to better"" the chance that Mr. Attalla's agent would win with a rival Rover. The Remondis also say Mr. Attalla ha bought a Rottweiler to show in another category and doesn't want to spend money on both Cory and the other dog. They claim that Mr. Attalla ha breached the pact by not paying certain expense. Stud fee are also at issue. The Remondis argue that the retirement ""fraudulently"" deprives them of their opportunity to show Cory, a dog who they assert ""is in the best condition of his life.""McFadden and his wife, Taffe, run their dog handling business in Campbelland do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings.

I never got tired of him.""; A dog's life; Had hebeen a different breed he would have been a ""character actor,"" Wegman said,""like Lassie.""; When Man Ray, who had become world famous, died of cancerin 1981, at the age of 11 year and 8 month, the artist mourned. ""I dreamedthat he came back to life,"" said Wegman, who spent three year living withouta dog. ""It wa kind of liberating, the year I didn't have a dog.""; In1984, however, he got another Weimaraner, which wa stolen. Yet another dogdied of Parvo, a virus.

""It's the highest in protein."" he said. He oftenadds a spoonful of plain yogurt or cottage cheese. The dog eat again at 6p.m.; The house is designed for both human and canine comfort. There isnowhere that Wegman go that the dog do not. The yard is a run of dirt andconcrete.

48,d078b,"Spike Lee may have been wearing aGeorgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he got a far warmerreception from Syracuse University student than he did fromAcademy Award voters.In a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday, Leeshrugged off the academy's icy treatment of his latest movie, Dothe Right Thing, and blamed it on generational politics.The 1989 film, widely hailed by critic, received only twoAcademy Award nomination, and isn't being considered for bestpicture or best director.The academy's membership consists mainly of old people, the32-year-old Lee said. He said they were a lot more comfortablewith the black chauffeur in `Driving Miss Daisy' than with theangry character in his film.I still feel we made the best film of the year, he said.Asked if racism might have been involved in the academynominations, Lee replied, Racism's involved in everything.Despite the cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse student welcomed himas one of their own.He's an African-American, one of the first one to make it (asa producer and director), and he's addressing the issue andconcerns affecting our community, Syracuse senior Deron Harrissaid. That's why we're so proud of him.What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, CaryGrant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common? Theyhave never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements.Such flagrant omission are often cited by critic a evidenceof the unfairness of Hollywood's highest prize. Oscar's 60-yearhistory is filled with example of the film world's highestachievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Artsand Sciences.The latest casualty are director James L. Brooks, whose movieBroadcast News wa nominated though he wasn't, and Spielbergwho wa left out in the cold with his Empire of the Sun.Although Broadcast News won seven major nominations,including best picture and three acting category, Brooks wasstrangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch.Since no movie ha ever won a best picture Oscar without itsdirector at least being nominated, the chance of the once-favoredBroadcast News to be a big winner at the award ceremony onApril 11 have been significantly reduced.Brooks did better in 1984 when his Terms of Endearment tookthe lion's share of Oscars, including best picture and director.Spielberg's Empire of the Sun won six nomination this year,none of them major and none for director. Two year ago, TheColor Purple received 11 nomination but not for him a director.The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.I'm floored by this, Spielberg said upon receiving his DGAaward. This is the last thing I expected to happen. . If someof you are making a statement thank God I thank you for that.Why the Spielberg slight? Some observer cite the fact that only257 director nominate for the Academy Awards, and many areveterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose film arethe biggest moneymaker in history (Jaws, E.T., Raidersof the Lost Ark).The Academy appeared to make amends last year by presentingSpielberg with the Irving Thalberg award for consistently highquality of production. There wa no mention of the fact thatSpielberg is primarily a director, not a producer.The Thalberg award ha come in handy to acknowledge giant whowere overlooked for individual award. The recipient have includedCecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergmanand Mervyn Leroy.The honorary award ha also proved useful to salve the Academy'sconscience. Charlie Chaplin received one at the first AcademyAwards for his creation of The Circus and again at the 44thawards for the incalculable effect he ha had in making motionpictures the art form of this century.Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch,Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, MauriceChevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G.Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are others whohave received honorary awards.Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected to win anAcademy Award. I'd have to blacken my teeth first, he quipped,alluding to the Academy's fondness for actor who portray bum anddowntrodden characters.Alfred Hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why hefailed to win an Oscar: I suppose it wa a matter ofcarelessness.The overlooking of classic film and the industry's mosttalented filmmaker ha provided historian with cause for dispute.For example, Citizen Kane, which customarily place No. 1 onpolls of the greatest American film, wa nominated in 1941 forbest picture (there were 10 nominee in those days), for OrsonWelles' performance, direction and co-scripting with HermanMankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, plus art direction, sound,music and editing.The only Oscar for Citizen Kane wa for the script. HowGreen Was My Valley wa named best picture.Billy Wilder's classic comedy, Some Like It Hot, failed tobe nominated a best picture, a did Chaplin's Modern Times,Hawks' Red River and Woody Allen's Manhattan.Oh, well. Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line from SomeLike It Hot: Nobody's perfect.The Oscar statuette, one of the mostrecognizable image in the entertainment world, ha no copyrightprotection, a federal judge ha ruled.The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain,US. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling releasedThursday.The decision wa a setback for the Academy of Motion PictureArts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer ofan employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling come a a shockto me. The academy said it would appeal.The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alikemade by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright law, dilutedthe academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like theOscar, just two inch shorter and holding a star instead of asword. It had a gold finish similar to the Oscar, and stood on acircular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base.Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy isvery similar to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy'slegal claim, saying that the statuette became part of the publicdomain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the CopyrightAct of 1976.The film industry's top award wa distributed from the firstceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the c mark indicatinga copyright.The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only wa an honoraryaward but also wa used to promote the film industry, and thereforedid not have a limited purpose, a required by the copyrightact.The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuetteand that the academy's trademark and service mark for the Oscarand the Academy Award name and symbol are unaffected.We are surprised that the court would base it decision onevents which occurred half a century ago, overlooking themeticulous fashion in which the Academy ha protected the integrityof it institutional symbol for decade, Malden said in astatement.Free enterprise ha collided with the AcademyAwards, and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces.With Oscar statuette selling at auction for more than $10,000and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones,the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences isscrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished byHollywood hucksterism.If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, yourisk having your trademark become public domain, said Bruce Davis,the Academy's executive administrator, in explaining the lawsuitsthe organization ha filed to protect it beloved hunk ofelectroplated pewter.But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism,this year's award ceremony will feature a new merchandisingwrinkle: Some 800 limousine delivering the most famous star to theOscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted cooler jammedwith Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.When the limo door swing open in front of the Shrine Auditoriumand the celebrity tumble out, the Coke logo will be on display infront of an audience that includes million around the world.It seemed like a good marketing opportunity, said Coca-Colaspokesman Ira Gleser. The Academy approached our local bottler inLos Angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people.But even a the Academy embrace this new intrusion ofmerchandising, it ha lashed out at whatever else it considers ablemishing of the Oscar name.When MGM-UA, the distributor of Rain Man, published newspaperadvertisements touting the film's Oscar nomination before thenominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harshstatement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble. After the adsappeared, Rain Man collected nine nominations.We regard this a a serious matter, and we have communicatedour concern, said Richard Kahn, president of the Academy.For nearly 50 year, the Academy ha maintained strict securityaround both the nomination and the award winner. It also hasenvisoned the statuette itself a something of an icon.So auctioning the Oscar ha greatly distressed the Academy.The Collector's Book Store, local sponsor of monthlyentertainment memorabilia auction, ha sold off seven Oscars in thepast year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's AnAmerican in Paris ($15760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for1954's On the Waterfront ($13,000) and the black and whiteinterior decoration Oscar for 1941's How Green Was My Valley($17,715).None were sold by the original recipients; heir or friend whohad later received the trophy put them on the block.When Malcolm Willits, the book store's owner, announced that hewould hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy forAround the World in 80 Days, the Academy said enough, initiatinga court action that, for now, ha blocked any future trophy sales.The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winnersmandates that they will not sell the trophy without first offeringthem to the Academy for a nominal fee.But now that the word is out that these award are worth$10,000 to $50000, people are reluctant to sell them back to theAcademy for $10, Willits said.The Academy ha created something of great value here. This isthe most famous award in the world the most instantly recognizableaward. The Nobel Prize might be a greater honor, but people knowmore about what an Academy Award look like.And they're very limited, too. There's not too many of themaround. . Twenty year ago, you wouldn't have a movie poster inyour living room unless you were a college student. Now, you can gointo Beverly Hills home and there's a movie poster, and the darnthing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.When the Academy won a court order temporarily blocking futureauctions, Willits decided to sell his store. It seemed to be thefinal straw. I don't like lawsuit, he said. I'm getting olderand I'd like to write movie scripts.Yet the Academy ha lost it most recent attempt to save itstrophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought againstthe Houston International Film Festival wa dismissed March 16 in aCalifornia federal court.The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed andbuilt by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, wa practicallyidentical to the Oscar. The court found otherwise.The motion picture industry's most covetedaward, Oscar, wa created 60 year ago and 1,816 of the statuetteshave been produced so far.Weighing 8{ pound and standing 13{ inch tall, Oscar wascreated by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio art director Cedric Gibbons,who went on to win 11 of the trophies.Oscar, manufactured by the RS. Owens Co., Chicago, is made ofBritannia metal, copper plate, nickel plate and gold plate. From1942 to 1944, the trophy wa made of plaster, but winner werelater presented with the real thing.According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,the only engraving mistake wa in 1938 when the best actor trophygiven to Spencer Tracy for Boy's Town read: Best Actor: DickTracy.The Academy hold all the right on the statue and reservesthe right to buy back an Oscar before someone take it to a pawnshop, said Academy spokesman Bob Werden.The most-nominated film wa All About Eve in 1950. It got 14nominations. Ben-Hur in 1959 wa the most-awarded film with 11,and Walt Disney wa the most-awarded person with 32.Oscar selection ha come under scrutiny a filmstudios go to new length to pull vote out of the Academy of MotionPicture Arts and Sciences.And with the flood of Oscar vote enticement from free coffeemugs to complimentary buffet dinner Academy member areacknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee, inviolation of the rule. Secretaries, spouse and friend, severalAcademy member say, are marking ballot in what is supposed to bethe entertainment industry's most esteemed award competition.It's like a local election of judge, said Academy memberHarry Clein, who said he's witnessed team voting. A lot of peopledon't know who the candidate are. So they take a look at who'saround them and see what the consensus is.As far a election go, it's not bad. But I've never beenthrough an election in Argentina.Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accountingfirm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee thatAcademy member have actually filled out their own ballots.All we know is that a properly numbered ballot ha beenreturned, he said. Members are on the honor system to fill outthe ballot themselves.More than 4,600 member were given ballot this year for the 61stAnnual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from theShrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Academy member vote on their areaof specialty. The Academy's actor branch, for example, is the onlygroup to select nominee in the four acting categories.Since the voting is done secretly member do not sign theirballots the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numericcontrol number, Lyle said. Ballots are invalidated only if there ismore than one vote in a given category, and only the vote in thatspecific category are not tallied, he said.Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and allspecialized category are handled by select branch and committeescomposed of Academy members.All voting member of the Academy can participate in the bestpicture nomination and may vote for the final award in allcategories. Winners for best documentary feature, best animatedshort film and best live-action short film are chosen by only thosemembers who have seen all the nominees.Academy constituent Julian Blaustein said that most of hiscolleagues take the voting very seriously. I don't even vote (in acategory) if I'm not familiar with the picture in that category. And I've never told someone to vote for a film, even when I'vedone some of them.Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rule are perhaps being broken,speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman. Although you'reasked to vote in the nomination for five picture, I think a lot ofpeople figure out that they have a better chance if they just votefor their own picture and leave the other four blank, he said.Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscarvictory have on a film's fortune, it's not entirely surprising thata certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars.The Last Emperor took in $18.9 million, close to half thefilm's gross, after it won last year's best picture trophy. Morethan 70 percent of the revenue generated by 1986's best picturePlatoon, came after the film wa nominated. On average, a bestpicture award is worth about $20 million these days.A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studiotherefore, can be a good investment. In the case of this year'sawards, a flurry of Academy-oriented newspaper advertisementsbanquets, complimentary gift and photo mailing tied to five latereleases appears to have been remarkably successful.This year, all best picture nominee and the large majority oftop acting nominee came from movie released in December: TheAccidental Tourist, Dangerous Liaisons, Rain Man andWorking Girl were all released after Dec. 16.While these five movie might be good, the nearly completeexclusion of film from the rest of the year ha highlighted thestudios' mastery of Oscar marketing.I think the Academy Awards are crap, said Terry Gilliam,director of Brazil and the current The Adventures of BaronMunchausen.It's about selling film is all it's about, he said. It'sone more way of flogging some film. When `Brazil' got nominated (in1986), they asked me to be a member of the Academy. And I wouldn'tjoin. I just don't want to be a part of that at all.And at least one prominent Academy member, director Carl Reiner,says that the manipulation of Oscar voter ha reached new depths.Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag vote forSigourney Weaver, a best actress nominee for Gorillas in theMist, could lead him to vote against the film.I have in my house more color reproduction of Sigourney Weaverand a beautiful gorilla than I need, Reiner said of promotionalmaterial sent to his home. We've got to tell the Academy to stopthis advertising. I'm getting turned off on the picture I like.HOLLYWOOD (AP) Like all great contest, the annual AcademyAwards ceremony ha generated a wealth of statistic and triviaover it 60 year of existence, all carefully chronicled by Oscarhistorians.Here, courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts andSciences, are 20 question about Oscar:1.

As wellit should: It wa the 1,215th time Bernstein conducted the orchestra.On Nov. 14, 1943, Bernstein, the Philharmonic's then-assistantconductor, filled for an ailing Bruno Walter on such short noticethere wa no rehearsal. The concert wa broadcast nationally onradio. And there wa such acclaim that Bernstein, who had never ledthe orchestra in concert until that day, wa catapulted to fame, atage 25.At intermission, Mrs. Artur Rodzinski, whose late husband wa thePhilharmonic music's director in 1943 and hired Bernstein a hisassistant, wa introduced from a box.Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in the Philharmonic thatSunday, is still a member and wa playing on Monday night. Eightothers who also were member in 1943 violinist Louis Fishzohn,oboist Albert Goltzer, timpanist Saul Goodman, bassist Homer Mensch,cellist Martin Ormandy, assistant concertmaster Michael Rosenker,and trumpeter James Smith and William Vacchiano went on stage.Bernstein gave bear hug to all nine.I feel older than all of them, said Bernstein.Bernstein wa given a silver box engraved with a reproduction ofMonday evening's program cover a caricature of him, with juttingchin, bright eye, flowing hair and baton, and reading with loveand thanks of the Philharmonic family to Lennie.Will this birthday never end?, he told the audience.Monday's concert began with Bernstein's Chichester Psalms,with the splendid Westminster Symphonic Choir. Todd Caruso, a memberof the American Boychoir whose voice is high, pure and moving, sangthe solo part.Violinist Gidon Kremer, a native of the Latvian town of Riga inthe Soviet Union, wa soloist in Serenade for Violin, StringOrchestra, Harp and Percussion. Kremer's sound isn't warm but histechnique is breathtaking.Pianist Krystian Zimerman, who wa born in Zabrze, Poland, oftenperforms with Bernstein in Europe. He wa the respectful andthoroughly engaged soloist in the final work on the program,Bernstein's Symphony No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra, subtitledThe Age of Anxiety after WH. Auden's poem.All the performer donated their service, with proceedsbenefiting the Philharmonic's effort on behalf of Americanconductors.For the New York Philharmonic, it wa supposedto be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich. The fate made it anight of Leonard Bernstein.The official catalog of his work say Bernstein led 74orchestras.

The substitute Bernstein programwas being repeated Friday night, Saturday and Tuesday.It wa an extraordinary concert.There weren't many smiling face among the audience ormusicians. Slatkin's brief introductory comment, followed by thewhimsical Candide, broke some of the tension.Then came the eclectic Serenade, which Bernstein's programnotes say is supposed to be based on Plato's Symposium. Itbegins with a lyrical praise of the Eros, the god of love. Thepiece is sometimes jocular, sometimes melancholy, sometimesassaulting and sometimes hedonistic. It end in drunken revelry, anintrusion of jazz - a if Bernstein wa looking down from heavenand telling the audience, It's OK. to smile tonight.The soloist - concertmaster Glenn Dicterow - played with muchagility, especially through the difficult double stop andespecially considering the lack of preparation time.The mourning returned after intermission, but not withoutoptimism.Jeremiah begin with suspenseful string, followed by acantorial French horn, a melodic return to the string and then aprophetic blaring of brass. The second movement continues thepoint-counterpoint of brass versus string (Jeremiah versus thecorrupt priest, with Nebuchadnezzar looming on the horizon). Inthe third movement, Jerusalem ha fallen to the Babylonian king.Judea is exiled. Jeremiah weeps.How she sits desolate -The city once so full of people -She is become a a widow.During her chanting of the prophet's Lamentations,mezzo-soprano Wendy White had to wipe a tear from her eye. S didmembers of the audience.Last on the program wa another Hebraic elegy, ChichesterPsalms. The New York Choral Artists and a boy soloist joined theorchestra.Two harpist dominated the center of the crowded stage.Awake, psaltery and harp! the choir begin in Hebrew.I will rouse the dawn.In the second movement an angelic 8th-grader, Evan Weber, singsKing David's 23rd Psalm, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall notwant.After he finish, the men's chorus bellows: Why do thenations rage?The piece, however, end in a Mahlerian motif and chorusdeclaring a message Bernstein had sought for society:Behold how good,And how pleasant it is,For brother to dwellTogether in unity.To emphasize the point after the final note, Slatkin suspendedhis hand for several long moment of silence.

50,d061j,"Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless lowpressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf ofMexico wa fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind thatbaffles forecasters.It's a matter of getting everything together in the rightplace in the right time, Gil Clark of the National HurricaneCenter said Thursday. It doesn't happen very often. How itdevelops, we don't know.Gilbert came to the attention of center forecaster Sept. 3 a adry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer. About one ofsix develop, said Clark.By Sept. 8, the system became a depression. It reached tropicalstorm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.A tropical wave becomes a depression when wind start swirling.When sustained wind reach 39 mph, the system becomes a namedtropical storm. It reach hurricane status when sustained windshit 74 mph.Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systemsdidn't is a mystery more or le, said University of Miamimeteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.The first part of the summer we were biting our nails,wondering why these (other) disturbance didn't develop, he saidThursday. That's something meteorologist would like to know moreabout.But the scientist do know what fuel a budding storm oncedevelopment begin. And they know that development is sparked whenwinds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture inthe lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 foot or so), thisconvergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation, Blecksaid.If cloud form, the heat of condensation in the cloudsoccasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergencepattern. That strengthens it, he said, adding that storm canbegin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.Eventually, a vortex is created.Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.That's what make the tornado, hurricane and blizzard, thosewinter storm, Bleck said.Hurricanes are useful to the climate machine. Their primaryrole is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,he said. The sun put energy into the water, the top of theoceans and lowest part of the atmosphere. That ha to bedistributed from the bottom to higher level of the atmosphere.When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados,warm Atlantic water nurtured it.This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best fordevelopment, Clark said. If you get a storm in this area inSeptember, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This iswhere Camille formed and exploded, referring to the 1969 stormthat slammed into the Gulf Coast.It is an exciting thing to watch. If you're on the beachwatching the storm surge, it's a different story, he said.The hurricane center said Gilbert wa the most intense storm onrecord in term of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inchesTuesday night.

51,d064j,"Two corporate executive sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clown. The subject wa no laughing matter, but rather the serious endeavor of finding South Korea's Ronald McDonald. Seven year after the US. hamburger giant first tried to bring it Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arch were finally going up. McAhn Industries Ltd. recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlet in Seoul. The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young. McDonald's is flourishing in 11 other nation in the region. But it entry into South Korea, which ha Asia's fastest-growing economy, had been frustrated by it inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from Seoul on term. South Korea may be one of McDonald's most promising foreign market, business analyst say. The country is developing an essential ingredient for the success of a fast-food enterprise: a middle class. Hamburger-related fast-food sale in South Korea totaled $87.5 million last year, a 30% rise from 1986, according to the Ministry of Finance. Analysts say this year's rise could be much bigger, helped by a 25% increase in wage in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expected soon. The business is likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipated post-Olympic economic boom here. However, the competition is heating up, and there is ""a good possibility that South Korea already ha reached the fast-food saturation point for it current average income bracket,"" an official for the South Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry say. The competition, besides Wendy's International's 11 shop and six of Burger King, a unit of Pillsbury Co., includes home-grown burger chain. McDonald's strategy is to take thing slowly, avoiding extravagance, Mr. Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say. ""We are starting small,"" say Mr. Ahn. ""We're hoping to open three outlet this year and five next year. After that, we'd like to open five every year."" Equally modest, he say, will be the initial menu: no breakfast, no Chicken McNuggets and no product tailored to national taste, a offered elsewhere. The venture is rejecting television commercial in favor of a cheaper, more oldfashioned approach: a brief advertising campaign in newspaper, distribution of flier and word of mouth. Mr. Sifri say the emphasis will be on developing McDonald's image a an affordable place for the emerging middle class, rather than a a familiar name for foreigner in South Korea. Attention will be given to attracting child, he add. Mr. Ahn say McDonald's talked to 16 potential partner before choosing the Harvard-trained accountant in 1984. Two year later, McDonald's and Mr. Ahn each put up $1 million in capital and borrowed an additional $4 million to form McAhn. McDonald's struggled with the government over McAhn's royalty payment to the US. partner -- the issue wa resolved -- and over tight import restriction on food product. The import question ""came down to finding a supplier locally who could supply high-quality beef and potato at a value,"" McDonald's said. Even McDonald's golden arch symbol ran into red tape, since the city regulates the size and color of sign. ""It may be against the law, but we're putting them up anyway,"" Mr. Ahn says.McDonald's hamburger, fry and goldenarches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened itsfirst restaurant in a nation famed for it distinctive cuisine.Hundreds of Chinese waited for hour outside the restaurant inShenzhen, an economic boom town near Hong Kong, for their firsttaste of a McDonald's hamburger, fry or shake.I travelled for four hour from a village to get here, saidHuang Rongti, 70, who ha lost most of her teeth because of age.You think hamburger are too challenging for my age?Later, after purchasing her first Big Mac, she inspected itcarefully before taking a bite.It taste good, I like it, she announced before slowlyeating the rest.The opening of a US. fast-food restaurant in China, wherecooking ha long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd togourmets. It is estimated there are more than 5,000 differentChinese dishes.In Canton, 125 mile northwest of Shenzhen, chef specialize insome of the more exotic Chinese dish, such a cat stew, bearpaws, chicken foot and a famed snake dish - Dragon and TigerLocked in Battle - made from three kind of poisonous snakesstewed with leopard meat, and garnished with 20 spice, lemonleaves and chrysanthemum petals.However, many Chinese, who earn an average $32 a month, arestill unable to afford fancy meal at restaurants.In Shenzhen, a Chinese special economic zone where foreigninvestors have built factory, salary are higher and workersearn an average of $53 a month.At the restaurant, a Big Mac cost $1.14, a bag of fry 48cents and a shake 74 cents.Another US. fast food outlet, Kentucky Fried Chicken, opened arestaurant in Beijing in 1987, and it now ha four outlet there.McDonald's hope to open a restaurant in Beijing later.Although Kentucky Fried Chicken ha become popular, the averageChinese still regard a meal there a a treat, rather than aconvenience, and McDonald's could face the same problems.The 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in a three-story building isoperated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a wholly ownedsubsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong. McDonald's Hong Kong is a 50-50joint venture with McDonald's in the United States.It is managed by a Chinese national, Chen Tikang, and his son,Chen Yin, who is the restaurant manager. The younger Chen returnedrecently from a course at McDonald's hamburger university in OakBrook, Ill.Most of the ingredient used at the restaurant are now importedfrom Hong Kong. But McDonald's executive hope eventually to gettheir supply of beef and potato from China.Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., saidit took two year to prepare for the restaurant's opening and hisambition now is to serve 10 million burger a year.Last month, when McDonald's advertized for 240 staffer for therestaurant, it received application from more than 9,000 persons,including college graduate, official said.I feel I have a better job prospect working here, and it paysbetter, said Henry He, 25, who ha a master's degree in garmentand textile. He is an assistant manager at the restaurant.A waiter at the restaurant can earn 53 cent an hour.A factory worker, who waited several hour before she wa ableto purchase her hamburger, said she liked it because of it sweettaste - the result of tomato ketchup, which is not commonly usedin traditional Chinese cooking.AS THE value of the rouble plunge and potential foreign investor worryabout a host of obstacle to investing in Russia, Russian official hadseveral reason yesterday to feel thankful for McDonald's hamburgers.Opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-storeyoffice block, Mr George Cohon, head of McDonald's Canada, could well bedescribed a the Russian authorities' idea of a model investor.McDonald's proven determination 'to be here for the long term' and to serveRussians in their own currency a opposed to the dollar charged by mostother foreign joint venture are just a couple of reason for Russiangratitude.Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, praised the fact thatMcDonald's get most of it supply from inside Russia after setting up aDollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow.He also thanked McDonald's for providing job, a model of western standardsfor the country's decrepit service industry, and finally for what hedescribed a 'the most delicious food'.But despite the jolly opening ceremony - with Big Macs, musician playingthe balalaika, and hundred of yellow balloon forming a giant M - life hasbeen tough for McDonald's since it opened it first restaurant in Moscow 31/2 year ago.Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonald's in the worldthe plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rule havebeen a challenge to McDonald's management, who admitted that they have noidea of when it could recoup it initial Dollars 50m investment.'It will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurant, what happens tothe rouble, what happens to raw material that we buy. We don't have anestimate of how long it will take. There are too many variables,' said MrCohon.Apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor, the McDonald's officeblock is rented out to western company in an attempt to generate hardcurrency alongside the mountain of rouble made from selling hamburgers.Communism suffered it first Big Macattack Thursday a McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia,and police were called in to keep customer who lined up for hoursfrom getting too unruly under the golden arches.I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburger, saidMilica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hour totaste her first Big Mac.People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plushinterior and the back-lit sign depicting the hamburger, frenchfries, milk shake and other fare more familiar in the West. Italso featured amber-colored table and floor, pastel-coloredupholstery, modern art painting and discreet illumination.The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, had drawncrowds in recent day, and they began gathering long before itopened Thursday.Police kept watch on the line of customer snaking around theblock, and they regulated the number who came inside to avoidovercrowding.No opening of a restaurant in Belgrade ha created such asensation a this one today, one policeman said.I think this restaurant ha no competition in Belgrade, saidMilica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger.It is much cleaner, the service is faster, the interior is nicerand it is not too expensive.The Belgrade medium have suggested that the success of McDonald'sin Yugoslavia depends on it acceptance by citizen long accustomedto a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: groundpork and onion on a bun.In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac andPljeskavica, said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, aYugoslav state-run enterprise that ha contracted a joint ventureagreement with McDonald's.Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslavmarket, said Predrag Dostanic, managing director of theGenex-McDonald's. We want to change custom of the local peopleused to completly different eating habits.He said that lounging at table for a long time after a finishedmeal will draw a warning. Also, smoking is forbidden and alcoholwill not be served.This contrast sharply with the Balkan and Yugoslav custom ofsitting with a drink in smoke-filled restaurant and chatting withfriends after the meal.The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink andfrench fry cost the equivalent of $2.57, or about a much thesimilar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joint around town.Sadik Seljami, a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a fewhundred yard from the McDonald's, suggested that the Americanrestaurant want to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlet out ofbusiness.However, we will not give up the fight even if we have tolower the price, said Seljami.Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp., said during theopening ceremony, We are very excited about the opening of thisrestaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communistcountry, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe.McDonald's and Genex contribute $1 million each for the flagshiprestaurant. They will also share the profit equally even though itwill be managed entirely by Yugoslavs.The restaurant ha 350 seat and employ 110 people capable ofserving 2,500 meal per hour. In an effort to keep a high level ofservices, the management is entitled to fire any employee who failto perform.The American corporation plan to open five additionalrestaurants Yugoslavia in the next five year. The next EastEuropean McDonald's, and the first in a Soviet bloc country, is toopen next month in Budapest, Hungary.The communist world get it firstMcDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whetherits American hamburger will be a popular a the local fast-foodtreat, Pljeskavica.The long-awaited opening of the restaurant on one of Belgrade'smain downtown square will take place March 24, the Yugoslav newsagency Tanjug reported, and it will offer Big Macs, fry and theother speciality familiar to McDonald's customer in the West.The Belgrade medium have suggested that the success of theAmerican restaurant depends on it acceptance by Yugoslavians whoare long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica.Pljeskavica is made of ground pork and onion, and it is servedon bread and eaten with the hand. It is sold at fast-foodrestaurants across the country and cost about a dollar.In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac andPljeskavica, said an official of Genex, Yugoslavia's largeststate-run enterprise that will operate the McDonald's.John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill.headquarters, said it wa the first of the chain's outlet in acommunist country.The next East European McDonald's is scheduled to be opened inBudapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna Milosevic,another Genex official.Negotiations have been going on for year for expanding thefast-food chain to the Soviet Union, but no agreement ha beenannounced.Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesdaycheerfully lined up to get a taste of gamburgers,chizburgers and Filay-o-feesh sandwich a McDonald'sopened in the land of Lenin for the first time.The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-foodchain rang up 30,000 meal on 27 cash register, breaking theopening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, official said.The Soviets, bundled in fur coat and hat, seemed unfazed,lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant, the first of20 planned across the Soviet Union. The crush of customer wa sointense the company stayed open until midnight, two hour laterthan planned.I only waited an hour and I think they served thousand beforeme, said a happy middle-aged woman who work at an aluminum plant.And it wa only 10 ruble for all this, she said. I'mtaking it back for the girl at the factory to try.Big Macs were priced at 3.75 ruble and double cheeseburger at3 ruble about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's stafferor the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other privaterestaurants that have sprung up recently.The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreignvisitors can buy ruble for 16 cent each, about what the currencyis worth on the black market.Half the day's sale were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund,which provides medical care and assistance to orphan anddisadvantaged child, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president ofMcDonald's Canada, said from Toronto.The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with thecity of Moscow that began 14 year ago, brought to 52 the number ofcountries where McDonald's operates.The previous opening-day record for sale wa in Budapest,company official said. Besides it restaurant in the UnitedStates, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan,the official said.Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concept asefficiency and fast, friendly service. Normally dour citizen brokeinto grin a they caught the infectious cheerful mood fromyouthful Soviet staffer hired for their ability to smile and workhard.Accordions played folk song and woman in traditional costumesdanced with cartoon character, including Mickey Mouse and BabaYaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales.One Muscovite, accustomed to clerk who snarl if they sayanything at all, asked for a straw and wa startled when a smilingyoung Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into hisdrink.For most customer, it wa their first experience with ahamburger. Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked withthe golden arch, but were packed in wrapper bearing Cyrillicletters, approximating gamburger.They tried them one-handed. They picked their sandwich apartto examine the content. One young woman finally squashed herBeeg Mak to fit her lip around it.It tasted great! a 14-year-old boy said.It's a lot different from a stolovaya, he continued with asmile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeteriasthat slop rice and fat or boiled sausage.Under the sign of the golden arch, accented by the Soviethammer-and-sickle flag, hundred lined up for the long-awaitedgrand opening at 10 am. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedlyfor McDonald's flag and pin a the hamburger chain's armyfulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenir with Western logos.Publicity-conscious manager had the staff shout Good morning,America! in English and Russian, for an American TV network.McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind thedeal, said many people were buying multiple order and therestaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first fivehours of operation.The restaurant limited purchase to 10 Big Macs per customer inhopes of preventing burger-scalping.McDonald's built it own factory, including bakery, dairy,meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide itsown guaranteed supply in a country where up to 25 percent of theharvest rot en route to the consumer.One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importingwooden crate from Finland for storing potato because when theywent to build crate, they found there wa no wood, and no nails.They found you need a permit to buy nail.

After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.

52,d069f,"The mass emigration of thousand of disaffected East Germans ha rekindled reunification talk in West Germany, where some legislator plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two Germanys. No one is predicting a date for a possible reunification. Proponents acknowledge the risk of assuming too much of East Bloc reform trend, and most hedge their thought with careful reference to Washington and Moscow. Yet growing sign of ferment in East Germany have given Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government reason to consider the possibility. Eduard Lintner, parliamentary speaker on German affair for the joint Christian Democrat and Christrian Socialist caucus in the Bundestag, said his committee ha placed reunification on it October agenda. He said the session, which will include government official and outside expert, hopefully can devise reunification model to discus with West Germany's Western ally, particularly the US. ""It ha become clear to the world that the Communist system in East Germany is in trouble,"" Mr. Lintner said. ""The time ha come for u to show our ally, but also reform-minded people in the East, that German reunification is no longer just a theory but a subject requiring a serious appraisal of how it could come about."" ""There are still a number of imponderables,"" Mr. Linter conceded. ""For instance, we want the federal government to approach our ally and get their thought on the reunification topic."" The US. ambassador to Bonn, Vernon A. Walters, earlier this month reaffirmed Washington's policy of supporting a German reunification based on free, democratic election. But Mr. Walters caused a stir by predicting that reunion could occur in the relatively near future. Emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany ha raised question on how long East Berlin's leader can resist the democratic reform sweeping through neighboring East Bloc country. Reforms in Poland, Hungary and even the Soviet Union have magnified East Germany's Stalinist control. Fledgling protest group, and the influential Protestant church, have begun pressing for reform in East Germany which, if allowed to include free election, could eventually lead to a reunited Germany, according to some Western expert. Dorothee Wilms, Bonn's cabinet minister for inter-German affair, said in an interview in the newspaper Welt am Sonntag that recent poll show that between 85% and 90% of all West Germans favor a reunifed Germany. ""The desire for reunification, a feeling of togetherness, a sense of nationhood -- all this ha strongly increased in recent years,"" Ms. Wilms told the newspaper. ""The recent escape movement from the DDR make especially clear that people of both German state want to live free amongst themselves,"" she said, but cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight. The first step, she added, ""is the reform process in the DDR."" Most West German government since 1949 have paid only lip service to the reunification goal set down in the preamble of West Germany's constitution. Political reality have prevented the topic from becoming a serious issue. Analysts say that four decade of different system would make reunification difficult. Further, many West German worker worry that a mass influx of East Germans could threaten their job. Thousands of East Germans have emigrated to West Germany over the Austro-Hungarian border since Budapest ignored East Berlin's protest and opened it border. Close to 80,000 East German refugee have arrived in West Germany so far this year, either legally or by escaping, and a total of more than 100,000 are expected by December. The Soviets have joined East Berlin in criticizing Bonn for welcoming the East German refugee, and chided Hungary for violating an emigration treaty with East Germany by allowing them to leave. Moscow, which ha tolerated reform elsewhere in the East Bloc, is said to be concerned by condition in East Germany, perhaps the most important of it Warsaw Pact satellite. Unconfirmed West German intelligence report appearing in the West German medium said Moscow fear a growing dissident movement and mass demonstration in East Germany by next year. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev accepted an invitation to attend East Germany's 40th anniversary celebration, providing an opportunity for serious discussion with Erich Honecker, East Berlin's ailing party leader. East Germany's Communist leadership, commented the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, ""has no illusion a to why Gorbachev is honoring their 40th anniversary. He certainly will not say 'well done, keep it up.'""The government on Thursday allowed for thepossibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must beformed gradually and respect Poland's borders.In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on theissue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament thetwo German state could be joined a part of the process of unitingEurope.He said German reunification cannot go ahead of thereunification of Europe.A reunited Germany will not be created tomorrow or the dayafter tomorrow, Skubiszewski said. Fears and concern appearingevery now and then, including in Poland, are unjustified, althoughalertness is recommended.Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk,Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers no politicalchanges in Europe, but there should be all kind of economicintegrations.Western European country have agreed to form an economic unionby the end of 1992.Sweeping democratic reform have taken hold in East Germany inthe past several week under the pressure of mass protests,spurring talk of reuniting the two German state divided at the endof World War II. West Germany ha proposed a plan for greaterunity, but East German leader reject reunification.The specter of a powerful, reunited Germany ha troubed manyPoles, especially the older one who recall the 1939 Nazi invasionof Poland that began World War II.A reported surge in anti-Polish sentiment in East Germany inrecent week ha heightened Polish anxieties.Skubiszewski's speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that thegovernment doe not see unification in the near future and willinsist on Poland's current borders.Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sprogram for gradual German reunification, offered last week, fornot making clear that reunification would respect the existingborder between Poland and East Germany.Some right-wing West German politician have called forrecovering the 40,000 square mile of territory that Germany lostto Poland at the end of World War II. The territory is aboutone-third of present-day Poland.East Germany and West Germany each separately ha recognized theborder, but there ha been no official assurance that a reunifiedGermany would also acknowledge the border.One can only unite within established border and withoutterritorial argument, said Skubiszewski.He also said German reunification is unlikely a long a WestGermany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led WarsawPact military alliance.The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership metto implement the final solution against Europe's Jewishpopulation will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conferenceon German reunification.The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that themeeting is scheduled for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day.The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification,said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.I think that the place where they decided on the `finalsolution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and theanniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day.Some 100 member of the World Jewish Congress from about 70countries will attend the conference at the villa in WannseeBerlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and partyofficials adopted a plan to exterminate the Jews.Jews have a right to state a moral position on Germanreunification and we will make a moral statement. And part of thatmoral statement is to see that it (the Holocaust) doesn't happenagain, Bronfman said.In the long run, he said, a united Germany can be a verypositive thing for Europe, but certain precaution must be takento prevent a repeat of history. For example, Germany's bordersmust be sealed in cement, and the country should not be allowednuclear weapon, he said.Bronfman said he doe not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitismonce the two Germanys are united. In fact, he said, reunificationmight cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings.Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't beblaming the Jews for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.The conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration onGerman reunification will be issued May 8. It will be the firstmeeting ever held on German soil by the World Jewish Congress,which wa founded in 1936 in response to Hitler's threat againstJews.Three decade ago, a West Germanpolitician said German reunification wa a sleeping lionessthat would awake one day with a mighty roar.Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at handto create a giant political and economic machine that coulddominate Europe.Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether itwill take 10, 15 or 20 year, say West German conservativelawmaker Eduard Lintner. We have the impression that thing aremuch more concrete than we could have imagined five year ago.The daily sight of thousand of refugee fleeing East Germanleader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalistWest ha revived international interest in the debate.Once dismissed a a nostalgic daydream, the idea of Germanreunification ha gotten a public nod from President Bush andsomething short of a categorical no from President Mikhail S.Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.The idea make East German leader virtually apopletic.If there were a free choice under the present circumstance inthe German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percentto 90 percent would vote for national reunification with theFederal Republic of Germany, added the 44-year-old Lintner in anAssociated Press interview.The West German constitution call for a united Germany, but ithas not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the yearssince the ruin of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West atthe end of World War II.Full national reunification would completey rework the postwarEuropean order mapped out by the conquering Allies. It is aprospect that creates unease in Britain and France, and in Polandin the East bloc.London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out apossible scenario that includes massive troop reduction in Europe,Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary.Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guaranteesfrom Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliance, theTimes' futuristic view continued. West Germany withdraws fromNATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany vote forreunification and neutrality.That sort of talk is being heard more and more a Moscow loosensits hold on the East bloc and country like the Soviet Union,Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms.The implication of pulling down the Berlin Wall and otherbarriers to link the two German state are enormous and, for many,ominous.As much of Western Europe head towards it own unification in1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even furtherto the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, anddespite it many flaw East Germany's economy is the envy of manySoviet bloc neighbors.A unified Germany could become the political focal point of acontinent already in flux, a democratic movement sweep part ofthe Soviet bloc.Older generation recall eerie echo of Nazi dictator AdolfHitler's boasting that he had brought about the unity of theGerman nation.Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and EasternEurope at the French Institute of International Relations, say shebelieves that a far a public opinion there is new sort ofmistrust toward Germany.This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France, sheadded.Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front line oftwo competing alliance, any sign for eventual reunification wouldhave to come from Washington and Moscow.During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said thatreunification is a matter for the Germans to decide.But he added: If that (reunification) wa worked out betweenthe Germanys, I do not think we should view that a bad for Westerninterests.For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a newsconference in Bonn in June, saying only, the situation in Europetoday wa determined by historical realities.Outside Germany, political leader and commentator have beensharply divided on the issue.In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to begoverned by old prejudice and out-of-date assumption, wrotecommentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent. The ColdWar wa conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the comingof freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which findsits echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater tie to theEast a chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn'tnecessarily mean a single state although he called reunification ahypothesis that cannot be excluded.As talk grows in the West, the position against reunificationalmost seem to harden in East Germany, a people leave the countryin near-record number. More than 100,000 East Germans are expectedto resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in theCommunist nation's work force.Little is likely to change in East Germany a long a the77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrade stay in power.During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respectfor Europe's present border a basic condition of peace.Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fireand water, Honecker added on the issue of reunification.There are virtually no indication that Honecker's successorswill be inclined to democratic reform, let alone joining thecapitalist West.The call for reunification have already found a sympathetic earamong some leader of the Polish Solidarity movement, in thecountry that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.After all, the abnormal situation of the German nationovershadows the whole of Polish-German relation, member ofParliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity dailynewspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearlyprophetic word of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German stategovernor who later went on to head the centrist Free DemocraticParty.Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not todisturb her sleep, Maier predicted in 1955. The lioness willone day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quipby Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: I loveGermany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.West German official and medium today praisedSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for softening his view onGerman reunification and said it could give hope to disheartenedEast Germans.Disgraced former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker wasreleased from prison Tuesday night after justice officialsdetermined he wa too frail to withstand the rigor of imprisonmentwhile awaiting trial on treason charges.Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germanywas likely in the future, but he added that Germans should notdecide this important question on the streets.He referred to the growing number of demonstration in EastGermany in support of reunification.Gorbachev's statement wa his most tolerant yet on the subjectof a single Germany, which ha been opposed by Communists for morethan 40 year. East German Communists on Tuesday endorsed forreunification for the first time.In West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher toldWest German Radio that Gorbachev had correctly analyzed thesituation and again shown his political skill.West German official and medium praised Gorbachev's view asrealistic and described it a an important sign of hope forEast Germans who have lost faith in their government.Communist leader launched their uphill campaign for March 18parliamentary election with a news conference to unveil theirEuropean concept that aim for a united and demilitarizedEurope.Party ideologist Peter Brie said the Communists support thetogetherness of the German nation, and urged a thoughtful andmeasured approach to reunification.In an interview with the West German Bild newspaper, partyleader Gregor Gysi complained that the reunification drive ismoving too quickly.Asked if the Communists oppose reunification, Gysi told thenewspaper: No, not at all. This process cannot be stopped anymore. But it is irresponsible to do thing in such a way now a ifit were possible tomorrow.The reunification issue promise to dominate the electioncampaign that will seat a new leadership in le than seven weeks.Increasing number of East Germans have demonstrated for unionwith wealthy and prosperous West Germany a their own economytumbles and an exodus of skilled worker continues unchecked.More than 340,000 people fled East Germany last year, havinglost hope that their spartan living condition would improve. Thedevastating flight ha included a many a 2,500 people daily sinceJan. 1.The Communists are widely distrusted because of corruptionscandals that have surfaced since the peaceful pro-democracy revoltlast fall, and because they carry the blame for leading EastGermany into it current economic and political crises.The man most blamed for the country's problem, Honecker, wasset free after an East Berlin court rejected a request that he bekept in prison until his trial in March. He wa jailed Monday.The court decided that despite the severity of the chargesagainst Honecker, the state of the accused's health doe not permitimprisonment, the official ADN news agency reported.A spokesman for Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph promisedthat the investigation against Honecker would proceed.ADN said the court acted on advice from two doctor who examinedHonecker independently. Honecker, 77, underwent surgery on Jan. 8to remove a malignant kidney tumor.Honecker wa ousted from the leadership on Oct. 18, aftermassive pro-democracy demonstration. He wa expelled from theCommunist Party in December and ha since been accused of treasonand abusing his power.President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday withEast German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open towardeventual German reunification.Modrow told reporter after the meeting that Gorbachev did notrule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time didnot venture to set some time limit for that.Earlier, the Kremlin chief said any such decision must includethe four Allied power and take into account European opinions.The development of event in the world, in East Germany, inthe Soviet Union demand deep consideration and an analyticalapproach to deciding this problem, he said in remark reported bythe official news agency Tass.Time itself is acting on this process, giving it dynamism,Gorbachev said. We have to act responsibly and not decide thisimportant question on the streets.Tass said Gorbachev emphasized that talk about restructuringrelations between the two Germanys must involve all directlyinterested governments.Asked by an East German correspondent about his attitude towardreunification, Gorbachev said the question wa not unexpected andthat no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it.However, the English-language Tass translation indicatedGorbachev could have meant there were no doubt about reunificationitself.Gorbachev's position wa similar to that adopted by Communistsin East Berlin on Tuesday. For the first time, the Communistsacknowledged German unity a a long-term goal but said it must beimbedded in the process of overcoming Europe's overall divisions.The Soviet Union traditionally ha strongly opposed any talk ofGerman reunification, but Gorbachev ha softened that position inadopting a policy that ha allowed radical reform in Eastern Europe.Soviets say the question of German reunification is to bedecided in the future.Gorbachev, in comment to reporter after meeting FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterated hisview that the existence of two German state is a fact based on theoutcome of World War II.But he added, The present situation is the result of specifichistorical event, a specific historical process on this continent.So, history should decide the future of this continent.I don't think it is a topical question today. A differentapproach may create a situation that would complicate the entireEuropean process, including the relation between the two Germanstates, Gorbachev said.Modrow said the two Germanys could work toward confederation inphases with no time limit.He said he agreed with Gorbachev that reunification must bedecided not only by East and West Germany, but all of Europe.According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action onreunification must not infringe on the interest of either East orWest Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the UnitedStates or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free DemocraticParty, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in Londonthat Gorbachev ha adopted a more positive attitude towardGerman reunification.In a TV interview on Britain's Channel 4, he also urgedeconomic union within 18 month a a prelude to full union ofWest and East Germany.Lambsdorff said that because of East Germany's politicalinstability it had only two choice unification or chaos.Modrow invited Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to visitEast Germany and they accepted, Tass reported.Modrow arrived in Moscow late Monday. A Communist, he ha movedforward the country's first free election from May to March 18 andbrought the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then.Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be freeof party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policywithout regard to national, regional or global interests.Whatever policy the Kohl government followed over reunification, it wasbound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressure inGermany. As the western German population is now aware, German reunificationneeds a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation ofeastern Germans' living standard until there is a sustained upswing in theeast - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbankwould wish.In Europe a a whole, very high real interest rate threaten to turnrecession into depression. The government of Europe have been remarkablypatient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 year ofEuropean effort for greater economic and political integration. Surely theremust be compromise of some economic habit to achieve the latter?It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-termreason for Germany to shift it anti-inflationary economic and monetarypriorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence isthreatening the EMU commitment.Beyond Europe, the dominant economic force are strongly disinflationary.But Germany is the one economy which, for reason of reunification, couldafford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front.Yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advises there are nogrounds for a cut in Germany's interest rate. This, despite theunreliability of German money supply data.The German government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetarytargets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployedin Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression.A DM exchange rate adjustment within the ERM is not the answer to theproblems. We need a prolonged low-interest-rate German reunification boom.The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen a aresult of Bundesbank interest rate policy. And this is aggravatingrecession.A future European-wide central bank must clearly - like the US FederalReserve - be more accountable in the broader European political and economicinterest.The government and central bank of Europe and the G7 block - including theKohl administration - should pressurise the Bundesbank, and be prepared toconsider constitutional change if necessary, to halt this idiocy.Howard Flight,managing director,Guinness FlightGlobal Asset Management,Lighterman's Court,5 Gainsford Street,Tower Bridge,London SE1 2NEHistorians say the world need not fear thatGerman jackboot will echo again on European pavement, but somestill see the rush toward German reunification a a setback astep away from the integration of Europe.For the most part, the historian say an East Germany collapsinginto chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a unitedGerman state.The West Germans are moving ahead not out of nationalisticfervor, but a perceived need to deal with a crisis, said HenryAshby Turner of Yale, author of The Two Germanies Since 1945.There is no such a thing a indelible national character,Turner said. I don't think there is any chance that the young menof Germany are going to slip out of their Adidas running shoe andpull on jackboot and start running around saying, `Heil!He wa one of several expert in German history discussing theimplications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by thefour World War II ally the United States, Britain, France andthe Soviet Union to accept the reunification of a Germany theydivided 45 year ago.University of Chicago historian Michael Geyer, a native ofGermany, said he feared the creation of a strong, sovereignnation in the center of Europe could reverse a more importantdevelopment the 40-year drive toward an integrated Europe inwhich industry, bank, trade union and even governmentministries have been collaborating across borders.The East German state is collapsing, said Geyer. Sosomething ha to happen very dramatically. But they have a choice the Europeans and Germans and Americans. Do they want to opt forthe European card or for the German card? I think they are optingfor the German card.I hear these day very little about what Gorbachev called `thehouse of Europe,' he said.The result of a dominant uncomfortably strong German state,Geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of nationalborders. It could also mean, he said, that American troop mighthave to stay in Europe a a counterweight to Germany.If I had my druthers reunification would have happened after1992, after the integration of the West German economy into theeconomy of Western Europe, said Charles J. Herber of GeorgeWashington University, expressing similar concern.Then there would have been fewer chance for Germanadventurers, he said.West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings,said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presentedreunification within the context of European integration. Theywanted to avoid arousing fear of a united Germany again dominatingEurope.Even if the history did not exist, there would be fear ofthat kind, he said. We're dealing not just with rationalcalculation but a whole host of emotional memories.For all that, Breitman said, One Germany is not onlyinevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany overthe last 40 year, my feeling is it is better than having a regimein chaos.The only alternative to reunification, added Turner, is anEast Germany in ruin, a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.He said Germans have no significant interest in territorialrevisions. Those misgiving are misplaced.Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considereda leading historian of the Nazi era, cautioned that reunification,if mishandled, could prove explosive.While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalisticdistrusts, East Europeans, living in closed society, have not, hesaid, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia,he said.I don't think the Germans are heading for Moscow again, but wehave to give people and the Germans have to give people time tothink this through and get used to it. . Mishandled,reunification could scare one or the other of the participant intostarting something and scare others and goodness know where itwould end.Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the divisionof Germany ha been the basis of a peace settlement which workedpretty well but wa abnormal and sooner or later had to becorrected.German reunification, said Craig, give the world the chance tobuild a new international system, one that will prevent the useof international violence.He added, We have to be careful that we don't fall back intothe kind of system that existed before the Second World War, aEurope filled with nation that were suffering various grievancesrivalries, disputed frontier, driven by what they considered to belegitimate reason but pitted against each other the sort ofthings that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.Chancellor Helmut Kohl assuredvisiting US. senator on the eve of a superpower summit that WestGermany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one ofthe senator said Friday.He strongly affirmed under no circumstance would a reunifiedGermany be neutral, Sen.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.  All European and Jewish issues were addressed.  Reunification occurred.",East's Economy Sagging. Soviets Endorse German Reunification.

The specter of a powerful undivided Germany troubled many, butparticularly the Soviets and Poles.Matters moved quickly in early 1990. Soviet President Gorbachev gave West Germanyan unequivocal promise that German reunification would be honored. Two days later, onthe 12th of February, said that negotiations with East Germany should begin as soon aspossible after the 18 March East German elections.

54,d062j,"Insurers face the prospect of paying out billion of dollar for damage caused by this week's California earthquake. Getting a grip on the extent of the damage is proving a far more difficult task than what insurer faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month. The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, go far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, say George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claim division. But investor are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two year of intense price-cutting war among business insurer. Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stock posted strong gain. Aetna and other insurer are hiring engineer and architect to help them ass structural damage. Most insurer already have mobilized their ""catastrophe"" team to begin processing claim from their policyholder in northern California. Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., chartered three plane to fly claim adjuster into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area. About 25 adjuster were dispatched yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computer, cellular phone and blank check. Some adjuster, already in other part of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicle and mobile home that could be used a makeshift claims-processing center. Insurers will be advertising 800 number -- probably on the radio -- that policyholder can call to get assistance on how to submit claim. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, belief the loss from the earthquake could be somewhat le than the $475 million in damage it expects to pay out for claim resulting from Hurricane Hugo. State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California. Earthquake insurance is sold a a separate policy or a specific endorsement ""rider"" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquake. State Farm said about 25% of it policyholder in California have also purchased earthquake insurance. Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., said about 23% of it personal property policyholder -- about 28% in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage. The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million is insured, it said. Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinate the effort of the claim adjuster in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today. They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damage in a day or two. Roads and bridge in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage. Highways, such a the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage. Industry official say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridge -- ha no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating fund. However, the bridge, which charge a $1 toll each way, doe have ""loss of income"" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven day. That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance company including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia. Earthquake-related claim aren't expected to cause significant financial problem for the insurance industry a a whole. Instead, even with the liability of two natural disaster in recent week, analyst said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it wa at midyear. Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of way. For example, insurer may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophe by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy. Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the loss the reinsurers will bear from these two disaster, are likely to spur increase in reinsurance price that will later be translated into an overall price rise. Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firm themselves. ""We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace,"" said William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry. His firm, along with some others, issued new buy recommendation on insurer stock yesterday. Among the insurance stock, big gainer included American International Group, up $3.25 to $102.625; General Re Corp., up $2.75 to $86.50; Aetna, up $2.375 to $59.50; and Marsh & McLennan Inc., up $3.125 to $75875. Still, a few individual company, most likely smaller one, could be devastated. ""I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skid on this,"" said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult. He suspect some insurer who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophe will discover that reinsurance wa used up by Hurricane Hugo. British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurer are bracing for big claim from the San Francisco earthquake disaster. Although it's unclear how much exposure the London market will face, UK. underwriter traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to US. catastrophe coverage. Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rate to soar. The catastrophe loss sustained by insurer this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire. Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimate that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured loss of $5.8 billion. He is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured loss of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 billion in cost to insurer from Hurricane Hugo.The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly. In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aide flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning. Some of it wa necessary to get federal help flowing to victim, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action. Mr. Bush and his aide were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan water and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charge now. So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 am. from chief of staff John Sununu. By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone call from Vice President Dan Quayle, who wa in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters. Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aide were trying to head off criticism. On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be ""less carping"" about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency ""took a hit"" for it reaction to Hurricane Hugo. The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend. He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leader urged him to do so.Most San Francisco-area homeowner mayhave to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their ownpockets, while insurance company may reap long-term benefit fromhigher rate, industry spokesman and analyst said Wednesday.Only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowner haveearthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percentdeductible and cost between $200 to $400 a year for a $100000home, according to industry spokesmen.The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento saidthat in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of thehomes have earthquake insurance. The organization estimatedresidential damage from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million inthe Bay area, with between $100 million to $150 million insured.Insured homeowner without earthquake protection will getreimbursed only if their home were ravaged by fire, which iscovered under basic homeowner insurance police, said Hugh Strawn,director of catastrophe service at the Property Loss ResearchBureau in Schaumburg, Ill.Insurance company attempted Wednesday to ass the amount ofquake-related damage they're likely to have to pay. In addition tohome damage, the company likely will get claim for automobiledamage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption dueto electrical outage, water damage and, possibly, workerscompensation.Some estimated that insurer might face bill totaling $1billion or more from the quake. But industry observer said theydon't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage fromquake-related claims.We don't think any company is going to have problem payingclaims, said Elisa Siegal, public affair manager for theAmerican Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group.The insurer actually could benefit. Industry analyst predictedinsurers would be able to reverse three year of declining ratesand win rate hike from state regulator due to the quake damagesand the estimated $4 billion in damage from Hurricane Hugo, whichhammered South Carolina and other part of the southeastern UnitedStates earlier this month.An increase in insurance rate could translate into greaterprofitability in the long term, the analyst said.There's a perception that this could turn the cycle . thatthis could be enough to firm pricing, said Gloria L. Vogel, ananalyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. in New York.Despite their prediction for the long run, the analyst warnedthat fourth-quarter earnings among insurance company are likelyto be disappointing.It's going to be a meaningful loss, perhaps a big a Hugo,said Robert Glasspiegel, an analyst with Hartford-based LangenMcAlenney.On the New York Stock Exchange, some insurance company stockrose on Wednesday. Aetna Life & Casualty Co. rose $2.37{ to $59.50a share; ITT Corp., parent of The Hartford, wa up 37{ cent to$59; and the Travelers Cos. rose $1 to $40.87{.Reinsurance company, which absorb risk from policy writers,did especially well. General Re Corp. rose $2.75 to $86.50 andMarsh & McLennan Cos. rose $3.12{ to $75.87{.In California, earthquake insurance is an emotional andpolitically-charged issue. Roughly two-thirds of all insurancepolicies written in the United States are sold in California, wheremany of the nation's most damaging earthquake have occurred..Under a 1985 California law, insurer are required to offerearthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not requiredto buy the coverage.Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance tocommercial property owner, but the percentage of business propertywith the coverage is very high, industry spokesman said. Theyestimated that at least 25 percent, and probably many more,business property are insured.Because of it high cost, earthquake insurance ha become atarget of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by Californiavoters last year. The proposition call for a 20 percent rollbackin insurance rate. Insurers and state regulator are battling overthe rate and how they're set.

55,d066j,"SAM WALTON wa arguably the most important retailer of his generation. Theson of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store inwhat wa to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwater ofArkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.By 1991 the chain's sale had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it theworld's largest retailer in term of revenue, and the Walton familyprobably America's richest.Wal-Mart now operates in 43 US state, selling good ranging from detergentsto golf clubs.The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality andwillingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.He wa a frugal, modest man who worked extremely long hour from a spartanroom in his Bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of theoffice to tour store and meet customer and staff, whom he insisted oncalling 'associates.'He would deliver pep-talks to employee extolling the virtue of thrift andcustomer satisfaction, long before these became fashionable managementbuzz-words.Employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptancein US service industry - wa also a vital ingredient in the Waltonphilosophy.He buoyed staff morale with cheer-leading session, bonus payment for goodperformance and profit-sharing plan which allowed some employee of verymodest mean to retire relatively wealthy.Eight year ago, when Wal-Mart's profit were better than expected, he kepta promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on WallStreet.Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth wa it pioneering of high volume,cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic saleswhich rival relied on to generate customer loyalty.'Low price always' became Wal-Mart's motto.Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount storescould not operate successfully in the small, rural town of the US south.It wa precisely such location which became the bedrock of the business,though in the process Wal-Mart put out of business hundred of small mainstreet store, prompting bitter resistance in some town which Mr Waltontended to blunt with generous charitable donations.Forty year after Sam Walton first hungout his shingle, Walton's 5&10 will reopen to show how a littlerural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center open Wednesday in thesame building on the downtown square where Walton first opened forbusiness on May 9, 1950.The center chronicle the rise of the nation's fastest-growingdiscount chain, using display and audio-video presentation. Itconcentrates on how the free enterprise system work and howWal-Mart thrived when similar company didn't.The window display date back to the store's opening, withSimplicity pattern and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and someIvory Snow. Inside, an electronic map detail the company's1,500-plus store chain today.Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Waltondonned for his dance on Wall Street, which he performed afterchallenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profitin 1984. The goal wa accomplished and he danced.The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture ofthe nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. ofDetroit.Walton and his brother, Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart DiscountCity in 1962. Both will be on hand for the opening, along with asprinkling of other dignitary, including Gov. Bill Clinton, thededication speaker.Aside from the other display and presentation, the center alsohas a replica of Sam Walton's original office at the store,including many fixture he used 40 year ago.Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton, a fat-facedbaby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s. Typical of the Wal-Martoutlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed a place to grow and todream in a video on the Walton family.After a stint with JC. Penney Co. and the Army, he opened a BenFranklin store in Newport in 1945. He lost the lease on that one,and relocated to Bentonville. That's where the story took off.Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, totake over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955.Walton said he wanted to put in about a dozen store andneeded someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and hisbrother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recentinterview.That's when Bogle found himself in Walton's learn a you gotraining program.I got home at 10 o'clock that night after scrubbing and waxingthe floor with Sam, Bogle said.Inauspicious first impression are part of the story. In onevideo, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton a chief executive ofWal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impression after attending theopening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.The first store, at Rogers, opened two year earlier.I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discountstore, or retail store, I have ever seen, said Glass, who waspresident of a drugstore chain at the time.And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recall that whenWalton took his idea of putting discount store in rural area toBen Franklin headquarters in Chicago, official there just reallydidn't see a future in it.Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and publicaffairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to it associate theterm for employee first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Martemployees are partner in the company and to Sam Walton'sleadership and knack for hiring the right person at the righttime.At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 store, employed272,000 and listed sale of $25.8 billion. Sam's Wholesale Clubclosed out the year with 123 unit and Wal-Mart announced plan toenter the California market.MADE IN AMERICA: MY STORYBy Sam WaltonDoubleday, Dollars 2250. 269 pagesBeing an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, a Ross Perot found out.The problem is that the great American public like it boot-strapentrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright. In a country where businesspractices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve. Avast medium circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarket who diedof cancer in April, negotiated these pitfall much better than most. When,in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, thepaparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied bychicken farmer, where Walton made his home. What they found wa a happilymarried, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted atthe local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus twohub-caps. Folksy wa an understatement.Since then, some aspect of Wal-Mart's business - it anti-union policies,the impact of it Dollars 40bn annual sale on hundred of Mom-and-Pop shop -have been subject to critical scrutiny. So, to an extent, have the lesswholesome adventure of the four Walton child. But no one ha ever beenable to make Sam himself look bad. The worst that ha been said is that hewas rather dull.Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusion. Readers will either find hisautobiography lashed with 'good ol common-sense and a lot of harmless, ifcharming, anecdote. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makesno excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at onestage, 'but one of my best item ever wa a mattress pad called a Bedmate . . .'A few snippet are more revealing about the character. There cannot be manybillionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - andhave the gut to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.Meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his businessis inescapable. In one of many contribution from friend and family, DonSoderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tell of finding Sam oneSaturday morning on his hand and knee at the local Kmart store, analysinghis rival's stock. And his wife, in a casual aside, note that when thecouple wa on holiday in Italy their luggage vanished while her husband wasoff on a similar scouting mission.But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhapscaptures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best. Explaining the annualcontest in which Wal-Mart executive choose one 'volume producing item' topromote, he recall the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow bucketsfor carrying bait. Glass wa more happily teamed with apple juice. 'So Iwould go down to the store, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . .put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away sample out of his minnowbucket. I particularly did it in store I knew (Sam) wa going to visit. Itdrove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarn tell only half thetruth. Sam Walton wa a salesman to the core, and seems to have packagedhimself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southernsweet called Moon Pies.For the most part, this make for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.Occasionally, it just grate. 'I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for aboutabout Dollars 300,000,' Walton remark, for example, 'just a little old bankwith only about Dollars 3.5m in deposit. But it helped me learn a lot aboutfinancing things.' Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?The real truth, one suspect, come right at the end of the book - whenWalton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have writtenthis book'. Given the pleading of publisher - Doubleday paid about Dollars4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, hecan hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it. But these are unlikely to becircumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis. At the end ofthe day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping mall, not the bookstores.The store manager of the Wal-Mart in thiscommunity on the outskirt of Dallas tell a story that give aninsight into the man considered responsible for a retailingphenomenon.Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretarytelephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters inBentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton wa about to land at a nearbyairport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bringhim to the De Soto store.Paying unexpected call on store is one way Walton ha kept inclose touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed byother Wal-Mart executive and most make a point of spending a lot oftime in the field.Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 store in the Dallasmetropolitan area, It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,'because they're always out.By all account, Sam Walton's personality permeates operationsthroughout the company.Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating OfficerDavid Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote thegospel according to Sam, a he is called.To paraphrase Sam's primary rule of retailing, Rule No.1 isthe customer is always right. Rule No.2 say just in case thecustomer's wrong, revert to rule No.1.If the principle sound old-fashioned and homespun, they arebecause that's the way Sam is, people who know him say.He shuns the limelight that his company's success ha shed on himand ha decided to refuse almost all press request for interviews.He's happy to chat with folk in his store, though.He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart associate thathospitality to customer is crucial. He preaches it in person or viahigh-tech satellite hookup with his stores.Wal-Mart employee became known a associate under a companyeffort to prove it cared about employee, partly to thwart a unionorganizing effort in the late 1960s.One of the most sensitive subject for Walton is the fortune he'samassed.A close associate say Sam would probably give anything notto be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiestpeople. The magazine ha estimated that his immediate family's stakein Wal-Mart stock is worth about $6.8 billion.Sam Walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in hisbank account, say Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.Samuel Moore Walton turn 71 on March 29. He wa born inKingfisher, Okla., and grew up a the son of a farm-mortgage banker.He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economicsdegree in 1940 and joined JC. Penney Co. a a management trainee inDes Moines, Iowa. After serving three year in the Army, he went toArkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventuallybecoming the company's biggest franchisee.The seed of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and hisbrother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S.retail trade.Bud is a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.Three of the four grown child Sam and his wife Helen had areinvolved with the company in various capacities.Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis a much asever, and is said not to suffer after effect from a bout withleukemia, now in remission. He spends le time in the office sincehanding over most responsiblities to David Glass. Sam is stillchairman of the board.Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourishwithout Sam. The answer is an emphatic yes because, he say, Wehave great people. The Walton family will always be involved, headds.Commenting on the future, Glass says: We'll be judged on whatwe produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past won'tmatter.Wal-Mart founder Sam Waltonpitched in to help check-out clerk at his store in this FloridaPanhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cashregisters.The 71-year-old Walton, considered to be one of the world'srichest people, grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and startedhand-writing merchandise price for customer so their bill couldbe tallied on calculator quickly.People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him,said store manager Paul Sively. He shook their hand and talked toeveryone he could. The register were out for about 45 minute, andI don't think we had one customer complain.Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit tothe store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer JanaJea in it parking lot. Walton often attends promotional event forhis Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said he had suspected the bossmight make an appearance.Walton continued talking with customer during the concert. Healso joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customer inthe Wal-Mart cheer.He wa up there saying, `Give me a W, give me an A,' and thecustomers went right along with him, Sively said. He even gotdown to do a cheerleader's squiggle.'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vanceand Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pagesMany people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream;few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boywho became one of the world's most successful businessmen. The church-goingson of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a storechain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before hisdeath in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.His company, Wal-Mart, made sale of Dollars 55bn last year, and afterWalton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four childrenheld between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of it growth. AlthoughWalton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchise from1945, it wa not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discountstore.At the time of it incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlet withsales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal DiscountMerchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailer. Ten yearslater, with 330 store and Dollars 1.6bn sale, it wa only the 33rd-biggestretailer in the US. Its turnover wa only 9 per cent of that of SearsRoebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest. Withinanother 10 year, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his deathhowever, published material about the company is curiously scarce. This bookattempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise ofWal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaininghow it wa achieved.One strength the author identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adaptfrom other retailers.Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing. Rather, he realised the threatdiscounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depthmany of the US's leading discounter of the early 1960s, including Ann andHope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.Walton learned from them all, but wa unique in taking his discount storesinto small town of a few thousand people, where shopper used to travellinglong distance were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby sellingeverything they needed.Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology. As early a the1950s, Walton realised he wa wasting too much time travelling and bought asmall aircraft to pilot between store himself - something he continued todo to the end of his life.Sometimes, Walton wa more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to bepersuaded by colleague to introduce computer, and scanning at check-outs -long before most retailer had recognised their importance - and to investDollars 20m in an internal satellite communication system. This technologyhelped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution system of anyretailer. But perhaps the most fundamental reason for it success, the booksuggests, ha been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive managementstructure.Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in BentonvilleArkansas, rather than in costly regional office, are despatched everyMonday by aircraft to their region, spend the week visiting store, workingwith staff and manager, and return for a day-long merchandising meetingevery Friday.They discus result, problem and suggestion from the week at a 7.30ammeeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district manager torelate the result. District manager hold a conference call with theirstore manager, and before the day is out, the content of the meeting havebeen communicated to all store department heads.The system mean employee can make suggestion to vice-presidents one weekand, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see it implementationbegin the following week.Even the world's most successful retailer make mistake, however. One wasWalton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's rolein 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both role in 1976after finding he wa incapable of letting go of the rein. Another wasWal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even forgigantist America.Then there wa Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street ifWal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984. It did, andhe did.The book also cover well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on theeconomies of small US town wa positive or negative.If there are criticism, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quitecaptures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growingretailer. Moreover, it make little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart cancontinue it growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way itconquered the US.But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success inbuilding his own American dream.He's ranked a the richest man in thenation by a leading business magazine, but to folk in Bentonville,a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.He's just a part of the community, said Curt Loyd, executivedirector of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce. He's a neatperson. He call Bentonville home, and that is special to us.Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Martstores to trumpeting his personal financial holding, is againshunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among theworld's top billionaire. According to Forbes magazine's July 24edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, upfrom it 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.He is unavailable, said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of thesilver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain,based in Bentonville, about 150 mile northwest of Little Rock.Shinkle said he received about 10 call from reporter Mondaymorning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspaper. Shinkle saidnews coverage about Walton usually set off a press frenzy forcomments from him. But the 71-year-old businessman declined tocomment.He feel any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual andhe prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,Shinkle said.He very seldom schedule interview about his feeling. It justputs him in a position he doesn't want to be.But Walton occasionally offer peek that reveal personalmodesty. Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton'sfamily-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost million in value, hequipped in response to question at a news conference on anothertopic that it wa only paper. Walton then changed the subject.Walton wa first listed by Forbes a the nation's richest man inOctober 1985. Three year ago, Forbes also began listing the world'swealthiest people. Walton made that listing a the richest Americanevery year since. This year he rank third, behind two Japanesebusinessmen.Shinkle said Walton stay busy visiting many of the more than1,400 store operated by the company he started a a singlefive-and-dime at Rogers more than two decade ago. He is out of theoffice up to four day a week, the spokesman said.He spends most of his time talking to associate andcustomers, Shinkle said, and he always come back with manyideas from them.Wal-Mart call it sale help associate instead of employees.When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans,recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, call came infrom all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.They wanted to know about the stock and the company, saidSimpson, who work for Stephens Inc. You'd think that he'd beliving in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas. But now peoplejust accept it.When it come out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,'Simpson said.

The FederalEmergency Management Agency said it wa setting aside Dollars 77m to helpLouisiana recover.Most of the storm's fury wa spent against sparsely populated farmingcommunities and swampland in the state, sparing it the widespreaddestruction caused in Florida, where 15 people died.Official estimate in Miami reported that the hurricane had wiped out thehomes of one Dade County resident in eight - a quarter of a million people.Andrew had become little more than a strong rainstorm early yesterday,moving across Mississippi state and heading for the north-eastern US.Several of Louisiana's main industry were affected, including those ofoysters and alligator. Wildlife and fishery secretary Joe Herringestimated a 50 per cent decline in the alligator industry. The cotton andsugar-cane crop were threatened, the state agriculture department said.Most Louisiana oil refinery, however, were barely affected and deliveriesof crude oil were expected to resume yesterday.HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in UShistory, yesterday smashed it way through the state of Louisiana,inflicting severe damage on rural community but narrowly missing thelow-lying city of New Orleans.The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headednorth-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesdaynight some 60 mile south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajuncountry.Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday wasmuch greater than initially esti mated, insurers' loss there are likely tototal le than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectation, a seniormember of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speed of about 120 mile perhour and caused severe damage in small coastal centre such a Morgan City,Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornado devastated Laplace, 20 mileswest of New Orleans.Then, however, Andrew lost force a it moved north over land. By yesterdayafternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that it sustainedwindspeeds were below 75 mph.Initial report said at least one person had died, 75 been injured andthousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deathsin Florida and three in the Bahamas.The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refiningindustry, although some plant had to halt production when electricity wascut.The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurer in Florida, saidthat damage to insured property wa remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bnof damage may have been caused in all, but wa mostly to uninsured property,he said.In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whosebasement wa flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile bandacross Homestead, 25 mile to the south of Miami, where a typical housesells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurer will face a billin respect of such property, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.Many destroyed power line are thought to be uninsured, a are tree andshrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area ha beenbadly damaged, a Holiday Inn.Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday andhealth official were warning the public to boil or chemically treat allwater.Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost theinsurance industry some Dollars 42bn. Further uninsured loss may haveraised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it wasestimated yesterday, a one of the costliest US storm this centurythreatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.Government official in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advisedor ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas.The hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causingbillions of dollar of property damage and at least 12 death, and yesterdaywas moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with wind of about 140miles an hour.At least three people died on Sunday when Hurricane Andrew crossed theBahamas.Ms Kate Hale, director of emergency service in Florida's Dade County, whichbore the brunt of the storm, estimated that Andrew had already causedDollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 7.5bn-Pounds 10bn) of damage.However, insurance industry analyst cautioned that it wa too early toassess the cost accurately. The US industry's Property Claims Service, theofficial compiler of disaster loss, had yet to compile a preliminary tallyof the Florida bill.A hurricane warning wa in effect yesterday along 470 mile of Gulf coastfrom Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Galvestone, Texas.Several forecasting agency suggested the likeliest landfall wa in centralLouisiana, to the west of New Orleans, possibly late last night or thismorning.New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable becausethe city lie below sea level, ha the Mississippi River running through itscentre and a large lake immediately to the north.Much of America's oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal Texasand Louisiana and several refinery were yesterday partially shut down.These included British Petroleum's Belle Chasse plant in Louisiana.In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some10-15 mile south of Miami. The town of Homestead, near the centre of thestorm, wa largely flattened, including a local air force base.Miami's city centre escaped with relatively light damage. More than 24 hoursafter the hurricane, some 825,000 household and business were stillwithout power.The brunt of insurance claim from the Florida storm will fall on the USindustry, and company with a heavy local exposure include the State FarmGroup and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck. These are also theleading property/casualty and home insurance group in Louisiana, togetherwith American International Group.A spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company hadroughly 20 per cent of the Florida market. The mutually-owned company ha noreinsurance. Its size ha made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and itsreserves, at about Dollars 24bn, have made it unnecessary.According to Balcombe Group, a UK-based claim adjustment firm, otherinsurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are HartfordInsurance, Aetna and Travellers. Travellers said it had flown 50 claimsadjusters in to Florida late on Monday and wa assessing loss. About 12per cent of Travellers' home insurance premium income came from Florida lastyear, and 4.6 per cent of it commercial insurance premiums.The last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989,cost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured loss, though estimate of thetotal damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn.US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were onstorm watch last night a Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping acrosssouthern Florida, causing at least eight death and severe property damage.The hurricane wa one of the fiercest in the US in decade and the first tohit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, governmentspokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four death had been reported on outlyingeastern islands.Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, saidtotal loss could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claim weretaken into account. That compare with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry loss caused by the last big UShurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989.The brunt of the loss are likely to be concentrated among US insurers,industry analyst said yesterday.Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-MarineAssociation, said that, unless damage claim exceeded Pounds 3bn, theLloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsuranceof reinsurance risk - known a the retrocession market - ha shrunkconsiderably in recent year, US insurer have placed far fewer of theirrisks through Lloyd's.Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimatedthat mainline UK insurer faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claim sofar.'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, headded, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters.Royal Insurance estimated the company's loss at no more than Pounds 20m.Among other UK insurer, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may facelosses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5mand Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each.However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength a it moved across theGulf of Mexico and there wa concern last night that it might head towardsNew Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flooddamage.Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabamaport of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night orearly Thursday.It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil productionfacilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil wa evacuating most of the 900workers on it offshore platform a a precaution.A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on theGulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and official there were reviewingemergency plan to curtail or shut down plant operations.Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coastof Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roof offhouses, smashed car and truck, snapped power line and uprooted treesbefore heading out over the Gulf.A million people had been ordered to flee their home in southern Florida asthe hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power andLight company said that about 1.2m of it customer, or 32 per cent, werewithout power.Some of the strongest wind were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables,just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Itsradar and satellite antenna were blown away.President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areasand made plan for an inspection tour of the state.Picture, Page 14GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insuranceclaims arising from Hurricane Andrew could 'cost it a much a Dollars 40m.'Lord Airlie, the chairman who wa addressing an extraordinary shareholders'meeting, said: 'On the basis of emerging information, General Accidentadvise that the loss to their US operation arising from Hurricane Andrew,which struck Florida and Louisiana, might in total reach the level at whichexternal catastrophe reinsurance cover would become exposed'.What this mean is that GA is able to pas on it loss to externalreinsurers once a certain claim threshold ha been breached.It belief this threshold may be breached in respect of Hurricane Andrewclaims.However, if this happens, it would suffer a post-tax loss of Dollars 40m(Pounds 20m).Mr Nelson Robertson, GA's chief general manager, explained later that thecompany ha a 1/2 per cent share of the Florida market. It ha a branch inOrlando.The company's loss adjuster are in the area trying to estimate the losses.Their guess is that loss to be faced by all insurer may total more thanDollars 8bn.Not all damaged property in the area is insured and there have beenestimates that the storm caused more than Dollars 20bn of damage.However, other insurer have estimated that loss could be a low asDollars 1bn in total.Mr Robertson said: 'No one know at this time what the exact loss is'.WHILE Hurricane Andrew wa wreaking havoc across large part of southernFlorida and Louisiana this week, a grade two dollar crisis (on a one-to-fourscale, four being most severe) wa blowing itself out at the end of atumultuous few day for US and world financial markets.On Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm wa inflicted aweek ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yield jumped sharplyand the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points.The flimsy wall erected hastily by the Federal Reserve and other bigcentral bank to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of sellingon foreign exchange market failed to hold; and a the seller pouredthrough the breached barricade, the currency dropped to DM140. This wasits lowest-ever point against the D-mark.The condition necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up incurrency market for some time. Interest rate differential between US andGermany widened over the summer a the Fed eased, and the Bundesbanktightened, their respective monetary policies.The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour wasalso making overseas investor increasingly unhappy about holding thedollar.So, too, wa the political hole President Bush had dug for himself in are-election battle that only a year ago wa supposed to be a shoo-in for theincumbent.Moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth it salt wa in themarkets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreignexchange dealer that the currency wa heading in one direction - down.While there were plenty of reason for the dealer to sell the dollar, thelogic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock market wasless obviously compelling.There are two standard explanation why a weak dollar prompt bond price tofall. The first is that it raise import price and, a a result, add toinflationary pressures.The second is that it make it hard for the Fed to engineer another cut ininterest rate to stimulate the flagging recovery, and raise thepossibility that rate may actually have to go up to protect the currency.The first explanation is not particularly convincing - import account fornot much more than 10 per cent of US gross domestic product, so higherimport price do not greatly effect the overall price level, which is nowaround 3 per cent and heading lower.The second explanation carry more weight. Although there is not muchchance, given the present economic and political climate, that the Fed willraise rate to help the dollar, there is little doubt that the currency'sweakness make it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policyagain.The fear that the Fed may be done with interest rate cut for the presenteconomic cycle wa also behind the selling in equity market. But investorsin stock were equally, if not more, troubled by the rise in bond yields.Just over a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which hasremained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy,looked a if it might drop below 7.3 per cent.The dollar put paid to those hope and, by the middle of this week, it wasapproaching 7.45 per cent, putting an upward pressure on the all-importantmortgage rate for home-buyers.The dollar wa not the only story in financial market this week, and thedevastating effect of Hurricane Andrew produced a typically hard-eyed,although nonetheless logical, reaction from Wall Street.The stock of those insurance company with the greatest exposure insouthern Florida, the area hit worst by the hurricane, all took a tumble.But the relatively modest loss in Geico, Travelers and Progressivesuggested that the market believed the insurer were reserved or reinsuredadequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims.The flip side of the hurricane's coin wa a strong showing from the stocksof home construction company expected to benefit from demand forrebuilding damaged or destroyed home. Since there are an estimated 250,000people left homeless by the storm, there is a lot of work to be done.The biggest gain among construction stock this week were posted by Lennar,Oakwood Homes, Engle Homes and Fleetwood, the largest maker ofpre-manufactured home in the US.

57,d065j,"Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination wassupposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator,but the dream faded overnight.Bush's surprise choice for his running mate wa supposed toignite a campaign that ha seemed at time to suffer from lack ofinspiration, but he quickly encountered question over his militaryrecord and suggestion he could best serve the Republicans bywithdrawing from the ticket.Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quaylemanaged to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech aboutfamily, generation and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bushadministration.Let's go on to victory! Quayle exhorted, a the crowderupted in cheers.The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calmself-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding hispenchant for extemporaneous remark perhaps another result of theunanticipated controversy.Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he wasproud to have Dan Quayle at my side. The two will stress theunity of their ticket a they campaign together this weekendthrough Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.But beyond the optimistic word wa an unsettling undercurrentthat threatened Quayle's candidacy just a it wa launched.Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi who worked for Quayle'sgrandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, a managing editor of TheIndianapolis News said he contacted the National Guard on behalfof Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and recommended himvery highly, the News reported.Quayle, a hardliner on defense matter, ha said he sought guardduty so he could attend law school. A Bush aide said the matter wasdiscussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led tohis selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that heused influence to gain admittance to the Guard.Bush aide said no thought had been given to dropping Quaylefrom the ticket, a some Republicans suggested. Quayle wa tenseand refused to answer reporters' question about the topic during abrief walk-through at the convention hall.It wa a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor,rapid political rise, striking good look and wealth have beencompared to those of John F. Kennedy.Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech,saying he wa proud of the six year he served. He also addressedhis relative anonymity: Many this week have asked, `Who is DanQuayle?' The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will.Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled outtheir ammunition. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle's namein nomination, stressed his campaign skill and sought to deflectconcerns that he lacked experience for the job.He's already spent 12 year a a congressman and senator. ...That is 12 more year of national experience than Michael Dukakis,and he is running for president, Dole saidSen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded thenomination, said Quayle would bring vim, vigor and vitality tothe party and would bring spark and voltage to this campaign.Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start on the nationalticket remains to be seen. Others, notably Democratic vicepresidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, found they couldnot.But Quayle, ever upbeat, wa determined Thursday night not to bedaunted by the prospect. Miracles do happen, he told his party.Dan Quayle ha not yet been nominated forvice president and already Republicans are comparing him to ThomasJefferson and John F. KennedySen. John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senatesubcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indianasenator speak, I'd say, `there stand the next ThomasJefferson.'And, added Warner, he doe have the same fire in his belly asour great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, aDemocrat.In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy forpresident and he wa the relatively same age a Dan Quayle, saidFord. John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 yearsbefore he wa elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years.What Quayle think of those reference isn't known. But hedoesn't like it when people say he look like movie idol RobertRedford.Whether, indeed, he look like Redford seems to be in the eye ofthe beholder. In the parlance of politics, it's an issue. They areboth male. They are both blond.The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage. The actor, who onceplayed the role of a presidential office seeker in TheCandidate sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop thelook-alike reference in his congressional campaign literature.Quayle said the news medium had made the comparison, not he, andafter he wa elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.And this week, he told reporter he considered the so-calledRedford look a stigma. He wasn't asked how he felt about beingpainted a another Jefferson or Kennedy.Meanwhile, fellow senator were trying to publicize Quayle who,at 41, hasn't had a chance to become a legend. He is a Republicanvice presidential candidate who is not, a Spiro Agnew once said ofhimself, a household word.To help him get known, eight fellow senator Wednesday tookturns telling reporter how much they liked him.We know him well, said Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.He's attractive because of his look, he's attractive becauseof his enthusiasm, said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 year of age, he's goingto send a message to the American people that the Republican Partyrespects young people who achieve, said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senator said that should nothold him back.Let's not start this business of who's wealthy, Sen. AlfonseD'Amato, R-N.Y.Dan Quayle's sister belief the Indianasenator won't let his candidacy for vice president hurt the familylife he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy.I don't think it will be tough on the family, said MarthaSaddler, Quayle's sister, who life in Huntington, Ind. Sincehe's been in politics, we all kind of shake our head at his hecticschedule and wonder how he doe it. But he doe it and love it.The Quayle family and friend were celebrating Tuesday afternoonafter George Bush announced he want the 41-year-old Indianasenator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.Those who have known the Quayles for year said the senator andhis wife have remained relatively unchanged by their year inpublic life.Dan and Marilyn Quayle met a law student in Indianapolis,married while they were still in school and remain close to many oftheir friend from that period.One of the greatest thing about him is the job of being asenator ha not changed him a bit, said Indianapolis attorneyWilliam R. Neale, treasurer of Quayle's 1986 re-election campaign.He's the same nice guy he wa in law school.Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis,introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering atthe Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.Dan Quayle, who grew up in Huntington, graduated from DePauwUniversity, a small liberal art college in Greencastle, Ind.,before going to work in the Indiana attorney general's office in1970.Daniel F. Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, saidhe doesn't expect Quayle's national candidacy to change him.I think his strength is he'll remember who his friend areeven after this, said Evans, who wa chairman of Quayle's 1986campaign.Friends said the Quayles are devoted to their three child andprefer quiet night at home to night out on the town in Washington.His family look like the family both party are trying toappeal to, said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in theWhite House and now president of the Hudson Institute. It's abeautiful family. I think they'll be a real asset.The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker;a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne.When they campaign in Indiana, the Quayles often tour in twogroups the boy riding in parade with Marilyn Quayle and Corinneand her father visiting county fairs.The kid are nonchalant, normal kid, said Mrs. Saddler.They take it in stride and play.In an interview with Indiana reporter Monday, the Quayles saidthey had worried during the vice presidential speculation about thefamily's loss of privacy during a national campaign.The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,said Mrs. Quayle, 39.Quayle said he had questioned each of his child about whetherhe should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it.Tucker wa fascinated by the idea, Quayle said. Benjamin wasambiguous but he thought Secret Service agent might be able tohelp him on test at school, Mrs. Quayle said.Corinne didn't like the prospect of having her father spend moretime away from home, Quayle said.She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush pick BobDole,' said Quayle.Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen.Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vicepresident at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.Thank you. Thank youMr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleague and I are herefor the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the UnitedStates.We are here to nominate one of the bright young light in theRepublican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, thejunior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.You know, senator get a lot of mail. Party leader more thanmost. And almost every one of these letter asks for help with someproblem.Well, three year ago, I received a handwritten plea from a6-year-old girl who after several day of long, long Senatesessions had a very special problem.She wrote, and I quote: I have my second-grade play tonight.Please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me.I knew Corinne Quayle wa from a political family because sheinvited me to come along, too.Corinne and her brother, Tucker and Benjamin, and their motherMarilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the UnitedStates Senate.Dan Quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted familyman.And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan wa there ready and willing to make the tough choice, to cast the toughvotes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into thelaw of the land.Whether it wa the budget or defense, tax reform or the INFtreaty, Dan Quayle wa there, a forceful advocate, and a staunchsupporter of the Reagan revolution. And now he is ready to carrythat revolution forward.And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try touse experience a a measuring stick in this campaign. Just let themtry.Now, I don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacksexperience. He's got plenty of experience, plenty of experience experience in raising tax again and again, experience in vetoingthe pledge of allegiance in public school, experience inincreasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts.And I just don't believe the American people want that kind ofexperience in the White House.It sound like a Dukak-eyed idea to me.But Dan Quayle's got experience, too. He's already spent 12years a a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital nationaland international issue that affect the life of all Americans andthe future of our country.That is 12 more year of national experience than MichaelDukakis and he is running for president.As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust. Iam honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr. Chairman.And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of mytime to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my goodfriend, Sen. Dick Lugar.He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even asthe world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebratinghis life in what is ambitiously being billed a the Premiere Dan QuayleMemorabilia Exhibit.; To those who say Quayle doe not merit his ownexhibition, Quayle devotee say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that heis, after all, the vice president of the United States.; ""We're preservinghistory,"" say David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator. ""A century from nowsomeone may want to do a dissertation on him.""; If so, Huntington will beready.; Relatives, former classmate and longtime neighbor of Quayle havedonated yearbook, report card, poem, letter, his Little League uniform, acoffee cup he drank from, a chair he once stood on during the 1988presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched, wrote,signed or posed for.; The vice president's mother, Corinne, donated a lockof his baby hair. The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture ofQuayle, then an aide to Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb, accompanying her to therace. And a former housekeeper turned in a 20-year-old piece of carpeting shesaved from one of Quayle's floors.; The exhibition, which run through May20, wa put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation, a sort offan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and time of thenation's 44th and, they say, least-understood vice president.; ""He hastaken such a bad rap,"" said Schenkel, a foundation board member. ""If peopleknew him, they'd see he's a regular person. If they had a chance to sit downwith Dan a a neighbor, they would see the extremely good value in the man."";These are the faithful, who have long since stopped expecting ""good press""on their man. Instead they measure news report on him by their relativenegativity, describing the best coverage a ""more upbeat"" or ""halfwaydecent.""; They defend the relatively young age of Quayle, who turned 44 inFebruary (""All he need is a little seasoning""); his limited experience (""Lookat what they said about Truman -- he wa a haberdasher""), and his passion forgolf (""He ha to have some form of relaxation""). But they are careful not tostretch the superlative. The description ""nice"" come up a lot.; ""He's notthe fool that the talk show host think he is,"" say Dottie Watson, presidentof the Republican Women of Huntington County. ""He's a very nice person, acapable person. Everybody I know say he can do it.""; That is not to saysome people don't have some friendly advice for Quayle. ""If he would slowdown, talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying, I don't thinkpeople would take him the way they do,"" said Jean Anne Drabenstot, the ownerof Nick's Kitchen, Quayle's favorite restaurant.; Hayden Schenkel, chairmanof the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of DavidSchenkel, say, ""Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentallybecame president of the United States. Most of the Democrats and even some ofthe Republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him a vicepresident, and they're 100 percent behind him. But in all due respect, we surehope nothing happens to President Bush.""; Quayle ha declined an invitationto attend the tribute, citing a busy schedule. Nonetheless, most ofHuntington's 17,000 resident have rallied around their native son for theexhibition, which track his life from infancy through law school, from theSenate to the vice presidency.; The free exhibition ha turned a gray roomin the town's public library into a virtual Dan Quayle museum. The displaypatches together piece of a life that until the last decade wa strikinglyordinary.; There is Dan Quayle and his brother Chris riding horseback andwearing cowboy hat, or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajama atChristmas. There is Dan Quayle with his Vacation Bible School class, DanQuayle with the high school golf team, Dan Quayle at 5 or 6 year of age withSharon McEachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival atthe Fort Wayne Country Club. It is all very 50, very Middle American, almostsurreal in it innocence.; There are window into the working of theQuayle family, too. For example, his father, James, signed the report cardswhen Dan brought home poor grade, and his mother signed when he brought homegood ones.; And there are letter and poem that he wrote, which only go toshow that one doe not have to be a Yeats to make it in politics. Dan wrotethis rather thoughtful verse on Nov. 22, 1960, when he wa 13 year old:;My Dad is very very nice; But he is not made of sugar and spice.;Sometimes he act a if he ha been disturbed; But at other time he is ascheerful a a bird.; The exhibit also includes the 1972 newspaperannouncement of Dan and Marilyn Quayle's wedding, the wooden ""Quayle & Quayle""shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here, and assortedcampaign souvenir, including the official air sickness bag from the 1988Republican National Convention.; Ultimately, the foundation want to builda repository for the memorabilia. It ha already organized a walking tour ofhistoric Quayle site, like the white, ranch-style house where he spent hisearly day, and Nick's Kitchen, where he like to order tenderloin, fry anda milkshake.; ""We want everybody to know he's a winner -- I don't care whatthe newspaper say,"" said Marge Hiner, one of the exhibit organizer. ""What arole model for our child, to know that you can be a normal person, comefrom a normal family and become vice president of the United States.""Republican vice presidential candidate DanQuayle's official resume say he wa the Indiana ConsumerProtection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit wascreated, state record show.The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effectJuly 1. Officials said Quayle served a chief investigator fromJuly until mid-September, when he became administrative assistantto then-Gov. Edgar D. Whitcomb.Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using a hisofficial background, say he wa chief investigator of the unit inthe Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.He wa assigned to our section in the spring of 1971, saidRobert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney inIndianapolis.He wa in fact the chief investigator. He helped get the unitset up. (But) it would not have been before 1971, Smith saidFriday in a telephone interview. We formally began operationsJuly 1.Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry wa inaccurateand said his staff had written the document.If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I didn't hold thatjob for two year, Quayle told reporter aboard his campaignplane.Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called therevelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland a cheapshot.Quayle wa hired a an entry-level research assistant by thestate Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from sixmonths of basic and advanced training for the Indiana NationalGuard.Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, wa attendingIndiana University Law School at the timeM. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News,helped arrange his job interview with the state. Evans worked forEugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher of the News.At no point in any of this did Dan Quayle ask any favor oruse any influence, said Evans, now with the National JournalismCenter in Washington, D.C.He wouldn't have been hired a a chief investigator. He washired in an entry-level job and wa promoted to a whole bunch ofjobs on his merit. It's a nothing story, Evans said.Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently hadsurgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, TimothySendak.Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who wa then anassistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to theestablishment of the Consumer Protection Division, all complaintsand inquiry were handled by me. The legal assistant assigned tome and utilized a my chief investigator wa Dan Quayle. Herstatement wa released by the Quayle campaign.The Consumer Protection Division wa created by the statelegislature to resolve complaint over defective product, falseclaims in ad, faulty speedometer reading and mail-order fraud.In 1980, Quayle referred to himself a a Vietnam-era veteranin campaign literature when he wa running against three-termincumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race.Quayle, who enlisted in the Indiana National Guard, dropped thereference after objection by some Vietnam combat veterans.In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he wa onactive duty for several period during his tenure in the Guard.The statement referred to period when Quayle wa in basic trainingand 15 day of camp each summer.Dan Quayle is likely to be a man on theoutside in George Bush's White House following a vice presidentialcandidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, expertssay.Encumbered by his image a a political novice who needed a bevyof professional handler to survive early campaign controversies,Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he ha few intimate orallies.Relegated in the campaign to small town and safe GOP areas,Quayle a vice president is likely to be given a traditionalceremonial role going to political gathering and state funeral rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had,some scholar feel.Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about adecade or more. One thing that political scientist have beentalking about is just how much the vice presidency ha grown. ...With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old day of politicsand funeral, said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of politicalscience at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who study theAmerican presidency.Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during thecampaign. When asked, Bush employed the stock line that Quaylewould make an outstanding vice president and had been temperedby steel a he weathered the early furor over his militaryservice, academic record and personal life.The president-elect told reporter Quayle would have access tothe same paper, information and intelligence that is available tothe president. But he would go no further in describing whatassignments he would give Quayle.Quayle say Bush ha talked to him about heading a space council,and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration'santi-drug effort. I will be a very close adviser to thepresident, Quayle said.But that's not the way everyone see it.Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaignswith substantial reputation and were able to place key staffer inimportant position in the respective presidential campaigns,Barilleaux notes.Dan Quayle ha contributed nothing in the way of staff to theBush campaign. He doesn't have his own big reputation on CapitolHill. . Dan Quayle ha no friend in a Bush White House exceptGeorge Bush, Barilleaux says.They're going to give him a lot of window dressing, a spacecouncil, drug task force, but he's going to be a man on the outside. not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis, except on apro forma basis.But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bushcampaign, say Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role inthe administration than he had in the campaign.Vindication demand that. Both of them will want to prove howright the decision wa, Mahe says.Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign a a lightweight,a man with little or no legislative accomplishment, untested andunqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Even somemembers of Quayle's own party were dismayed at Bush's choice.Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebratedgaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbledexplanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, I didn't live inthis century.Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, saysQuayle, while not the world's leading intellectual, is not acomplete dummy. He wa simply thrust into a situation for which hewas unprepared, Ornstein says.I think he's immature. He's not stupid, Ornstein says.But Quayle come to the White House with a very damagingstereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in thepolitical community and that's believed by a large segment of theelectorate, Ornstein says.That's going to give him a good deal to overcome. It's going togive him an enormous impetus to prove himself. That's going to bedifficult, given the office.Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution seeparallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon andSpiro Agnew. The choice of Nixon wa viewed a a move by DwightEisenhower to appease the party's right wing, and Agnew wa seen asa political nonentity.The natural response is to use him (Quayle) sparingly, a Nixondid with Agnew in 1968, Hess say. However, Quayle ha fouryears to prove himself, and I think you're going to see story intwo year about how much he's learned, how much he's actedresponsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988.Quayle admits the campaign wa a learning process. After thecontroversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence from hisBush handler, saying he would be his own man. He became moreaccessible to the medium but continued to adhere to the schedulehanded down from Washington and to deliver the party's scriptedmessage. Soon, he dropped off the front pages.And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at havinglittle control over his schedule and at ceasing to make nationalnews, he played the role of loyal No. 2 and even trumpeted his newanonymity.We have arrived a being a traditional vice presidentialnominee because we are either on the back page or either not on thepages at all. That's what we're supposed to be, he told reporters.That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in aBush White House, Mahe feel, since Bush want a private adviser,whose experience and opinion he respected . (who) ha never hadanother agenda.Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one manalone, Mahe say. You're never going to see Dan Quayle tellingtales out of school.

58,d068f,"Soldiers from three nation locked the doorsof Checkpoint Charlie today and a crane whisked away the Cold Warrelic that symbolized a divided world.A US. Army band played a stirring song about old Berlin a therectangular white sentry station, a place East Germans died tryingto reach, wa hoisted onto a truck for it passage into history.The famed Allied checkpoint by the Berlin Wall wa closed withan elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomat fromthe Germanys and the four World War II Allies.For 29 year Checkpoint Charlie embodied the Cold War, U.S.Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a crowd of invitedguests and journalist on Berlin's Friedrich Street.And now, 29 year after it wa built, we meet here today todismantle it and to bury the conflict it created.Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and theforeign minister from France, Britain and the two Germanys eachheralded the end of the checkpoint a a symbol of change.Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status a anAllied-controlled city and the withdrawal of troop within sixmonths after the two German state unify, which could come inDecember.The proposal, a translated into English by the Soviets anddistributed later to news medium, apparently would also include theKremlin's soldier stationed just outside the city proper. TheUnited States, France and Great Britain have an estimated 12,000troops in West Berlin.Berlin ha been split into Soviet, U.S., British and Francesectors and West Berlin remains technically separate from WestGermany.The German and Allied foreign minister are meeting in EastBerlin to discus the status of the city and a united Germany'srole in world affairs.All border are to be opened between the Berlins and theGermanys by July 2, when the nation merge their economies.Large section of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily,and US. official decided to time the removal of CheckpointCharlie with the foreign ministers' meeting.A color guard of French, British and American soldier strode tothe building and locked the door leading to each Allied nation'scompartment in the checkpoint.The giant crane then lifted the box-like building high into theair. US. Army spokesman Sgt. Ed McCarthy said he belief it isdestined for a museum.Checkpoint Charlie stood just 20 yard from an East Germancheckpoint and wa the only place between the Berlins that could becrossed on foot by non-Germans.The ceremony wa closed to the public but not to the residentsof the building that line Friedrich Street, which had been dividedby the Berlin Wall since 1961.Illa Wobig leaned out her window and watched the ceremony unfoldjust 20 yard below the fourth-floor apartment where she ha livedfor 24 years.I saw eight people shot to death on that street, she said.I saw an East German officer try to go under a guard rail. He wasshot in the neck.She said she also saw at least 20 successful escape, by tunnel,car and on foot.I saw Kennedy, Reagan and Carter give speech here, shesaid. I saw a James Bond movie filmed here. This is wonderful forhistory but it is sad for me. It wa part of my home.East German construction worker Andreas Bratke wa working nearthe wall in January 1986 when he suddenly bolted through the EastGerman checkpoint, down Friedrich Street and through CheckpointCharlie.I ran a fast a I could, he said from his home in WestBerlin. Checkpoint Charlie is a very important place to me.The Soviet Union said today that a unitedGermany can join NATO after a five-year transition period duringwhich all Soviet and US. troop would leave the country. TheUnited States rejected the proposal, a US. official said.The proposal wa outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze during international talk in East Berlin on thestrategic future of a united Germany.The remark, a copy of which were obtained by The AssociatedPress, indicates that a united Germany would be free to join theWestern NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period.But in exchange, Western and Soviet troop would pull out of thecountry and Germany's own military strength would be sharplyreduced, according to the proposal.Shevardnadze made the proposal a he met with US. Secretary ofState James A. Baker III and their counterpart from Britain,France and the two German states.I am underwhelmed, Baker said when asked about the Sovietproposal while posing for picture with the other foreign ministers.A US. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S.officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany couldjoin NATO. The official said the other Western minister expressedthe same reservations.The United States want a united Germany to be a member of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union ha beenstaunchly opposed.West Germany now is a mainstay of NATO and East Germany is amember of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seek to limit thestrength of the German armed force and to revamp their structureto make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensiveoperations.It said those reduction could be undertaken over a three-yearperiod. Germany also would be prevented from producing or deployingchemmical or nuclear weapons.It also said that within six month of unification, all Westerntroops should leave West Berlin, which remains technically undermilitary occupation by the United States, France and Britian.The four nation would reduce their military force in thecountry during a three-year period following unification first by50 percent, then bring them down to a level of token contingents,or completely withdraw them from Germany.There are about 380,000 Soviet troop in East Germany, while aquarter-million US. troop are stationed in West Germany alongwith ten of thousand of British and French soldiers.Previously, the Soviets had said their troop would stay in whatis now East Germany for several year, but had left unclear theexact plan for pulling them out.Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal ofthe Western Allies' Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big FourPowers' troop out of greater Berlin within six month afterunification.The proposal, a translated into English by the Soviets anddistributed to the news medium, apparently would also include theKremlin's soldier stationed just outside the city proper.The United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated12,000 troop in West Berlin.
