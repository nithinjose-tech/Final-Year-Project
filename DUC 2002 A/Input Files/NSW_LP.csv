0,d116i,"Five astronauts board Discovery today second try send hubble Space Telescope orbit scan outermost reaches universe clues begin time. Astronomers start tingle anticipation Hubble able accomplish, say Lennard Fisk, head NASA science activities. Air Force forecasters say 90 percent chance weather would favorable launch shuttle schedule time 8:31 a.m. EDT. more half million gallons liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen pump space ship's fuel tanks midnight. The astronauts, wear bright orange flight suits, climb crew cabin dawn break Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costly cargo, give astronomers new set eyes ears have, say William Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program. It's go change perspective altogether. I can't say we're go learn, I'll astound learn many new things. Discovery aim altitude 380 miles, high shuttle ever gone, telescope place proper orbit far Earth's distort atmosphere. It 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, journey space next month Astro observatory, sat launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery, second time pads occupied; first 1986 Challenger explosion. hubble wait take place space since 1983, delayed technical problems Challenger accident. The late postponement occur April 10, Discovery's launch scrub four minutes liftoff faulty power unit shuttle. The mood Kennedy Space Center considerably less festive first launch attempt, hundreds astronomers gather families. The day launch, mission specialist Steven a. Hawley use shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescope space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II Kathryn Sullivan assist problem develops. Discovery follow hubble 40 miles away two days lens cap opened, expose finely polish 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Hubble expect start provide scientific data satellite month liftoff. However, NASA say release first image open star cluster constellation Carina week launch. In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million spent spare parts, astronaut training computer software operate instrument. The european Space Agency contribute $250 million 15 percent view time. NASA estimate cost $200 million year operate maintain telescope space. During 15-year work lifetime, telescope provide astronomers 10 times good resolution 25 times sensitivity ground-based observatories. As result, able study stars galaxies distant light travel toward Earth 14 billion years. Astronomers hope learn whether universe create 15 billion years ago believe uncover mystery surround galaxies, black holes quasars. Hubble also expect shed light universe might end. The telescope name late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, discover 1920s universe expanding. His work give rise Big Bang theory universe create tremendous explosion. In addition Hubble, Discovery carry human skull fill sensors measure space radiation astronauts receive. It skull's third trip space. The shuttle end five-day mission landing Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronauts return Sunday second attempt launch shuttle NASA's valuable celebrate payload, $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery schedule lift 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. We feel confident things go go well time, say Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're go come OK Tuesday morning and, not, we'll keep try do. That's kind name game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach say Sunday countdown proceed smoothly shuttle appeared perfect condition. The countdown get way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit force first launch attempt scrub four minutes liftoff April 10. The unit replace new one, tests show fine. Hopefully, we'll get shuttle pad time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance favorable weather expect launch time, low clouds main concern, say Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front north expect pas area Monday night. The outlook considerably better Wednesday Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronauts arrive Johnson Space Center Houston early Sunday afternoon, shuttle Columbia transport launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery. It second time shuttle launch pads Kennedy Space Center occupy simultaneously. The first time January 1986; 16 days Columbia lift off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand say believe National Aeronautics Space Administration move fast shuttle. NASA expect launch Columbia astronomical observatory call Astro earlier May 16, one week later plan Discovery's two-week delay. In cases, could problem shuttles launch pads, Brand said. In particular case, everything's fit together. NASA Saturday get Discovery ground. After that, launch attempts must halt eight days Hubble's batteries recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries power hubble time disconnect Discovery's electrical system two energy-collecting solar panels take space. Discovery's payload bay seal late Saturday night, drastically reduce risk contamination telescope's finely polish 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery aim altitude 380 miles, high shuttle ever gone, telescope place proper orbit far Earth's distort atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey space, astronomers expect look back nearly begin time solve universe's perplex mysteries. Astro measure ultraviolet radiation undetected Hubble thus provide additional targets telescope. The $100 million observatory also focus Columbia's nine-day mission Comet Austin, believe first trip solar system. Both Hubble Astro schedule launch 1986, delayed Challenger accident. The hubble Space Telescope awaken self-induced sleep today still without use high-speed antennas, science instruments hold, unable begin observations. We `safe-mode' right now, say Steve Terry, supervisor engineers control telescope. He say telescope run normal control-all mode, computers sensors guide pointing. Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, pack gear return Earth Sunday, make last-minute observations Earth talk ground-based reporters flight. Pilot Charles Bolden say especially upbeat widespread public awareness telescope, expect eventually look back 14 billion light years nearly birth universe. It's hard go somewhere find someone never hear hubble Space Telescope, say Bolden. It make little kids' eyes light up. It make little kids want learn add subtract study science. The telescope's big eye remain open, Hubble safe mode motion stop early problems link high-speed dish antennas relay satellite. The antennas primary links relay scientific data ground. Terry say even safe mode, one tape recorders telescope reads telemetry signals systems would play Earth analyzed antenna work properly. We expect use data investigate happened, said. Engineers able send commands telescope via secondary antennas communications system useful scientific data, must transmit high rate speed. We're put scientific instruments hold mode, effect standby mode, said. shortly 6 a.m. EDT, controllers Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md., complete series commands take telescope safe mode begin run 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health. It take another day $1.5 billion telescope operate way suppose point startup process, say hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're back deliberate slow careful approach problems, Olivier say Friday. This time anything dumb. The telescope problems put flight center several days behind, five astronauts deploy earlier week stick schedule. Landing schedule 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., flight controllers keep close watch weather. Winds predict 20 mph gusts 29 mph. Mission rules dictate headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph touchdown. The shuttle carry enough supplies stay orbit three days beyond Sunday necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awaken crew members 1:30 a.m. EDT today play song, Cosmos. Thanks wake-up music, pretty appropriate today, say Commander Loren Shriver. The song select honor hubble Space Telescope, open business, say Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronauts finish experiments photography today pack trip home. They also plan hold news conference space reporters Johnson Space Center. Shriver pilot Charles Bolden run series tests make certain shuttle's computers control jets ready return Earth. The crew deploy Hubble Wednesday stay close telescope case trouble open aperture door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan prepare perform space walk today crank open orbit 380 miles earth. But prove unnecessary door open Friday morning, expose telescope's finely polish 94.5-inch eye starlight first time. Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stop work door opened, engineers later get back line. The gyroscopes knock motion that, too, keep telescope safe mode, say Dave Drachlis, director orbital verifications goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, say Hubble's systems set conservative limits first operations cause many malfunctions. There also two communications outages total several hours. hubble design safe modes master destiny case contact orbit communications system lose extended periods, Terry said. NASA plan release first test image telescope Tuesday, show open star cluster constellation Carina. But Terry say would delay antenna problems. Scientific data follow month two. The telescope, name late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, enable astronomers 15-year work lifetime look back 14 billion years possibly determine age universe. The universe believe create 15 billion years ago cosmic explosion. Hubble provide basis big-bang theory creation. He discover 1920s universe expand farther galaxy Earth, faster move away. After years delay last-minute snag, hubble Space Telescope free shuttle Discovery Wednesday and, glint sunlight, drift orbit 15-year search new worlds. Mission specialist Steven Hawley release hubble end shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm delay get one telescope's solar wings unfurled. The first NASA's great observatories station 330 nautical miles Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really look great flew away it, sure hope good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver say later. The $1.5 billion telescope release 3:38 p.m. EDT shuttle enter 20th orbit Earth, nearly two hours one orbit later planned. The shuttle back away. Thank much ride, say Mike Harrington, director orbital verifications Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan shuttle's airlock, ready walk inspace free solar panel. That prove unnecessary. Close cigar, better Hubble go way did, Sullivan said. She McCandless train nearly five years make rescue mission. The first solar array unreel mast midday Wednesday shuttle pass 380 statute miles, 330 nautical miles, South America's eastern coast. It start provide power telescope's batteries, otherwise eight hours charge. Deployment starboard panel, however, troublesome. It budge latches first released, move fifth 39-foot length, stop again. A third attempt roll panel way. Houston, see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley begin long process release Hubble shortly 7 a.m. EDT grasp Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm carefully hoist 12{-ton telescope high shuttle. Hubble take shuttle electrical power lift cargo bay operate nickel-hydrogen batteries. At one day, seven minutes flight Discovery, Hubble internal power, Carr said. The game begun. The race on. The clock ticking. Worries telescope's instruments would starve electricity ease first solar panel stretch out. Television cameras aboard Discovery show first array pull reel slowly steadily, sun reflect gold-colored panel silvery telescope. Discovery 380 statute miles earth, 70 miles higher shuttle ever flown. The orbit dictate need put telescope Earth's distort atmosphere. Discovery's five astronauts awe view. I'd like pas quote day on-board astronomer something effect big marble sure look far away today, Shriver say Hawley. Astronomers wait seven years hubble take place space. The telescope originally schedule launch 1983, technical problems Challenger explosion push back. The mission delay another two weeks faulty power unit Discovery force National Aeronautics Space Administration halt first launch attempt four minutes April 10's schedule liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blast space, transport hubble world search others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door open Friday, expose finely polish 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Discovery follow hubble case door open properly. If problem develops, McCandless Sullivan prepare walk space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, say telescope would test Thursday ability maneuever aperture door opened. We want full control ever endanger hubble put aperture door close sunlight, said. The telescope cannot focus sun sensitivity five instruments. If go well, crew land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expect release first image telescope open star cluster constellation Carina Tuesday. Data follow month two. Astronomers hope look back almost begin time, study stars galaxies distant light travel earth 14 billion years. They expect determine precisely universe formed, currently estimate 15 billion years ago. The telescope name late american astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, discover 1920s universe expanding. He also responsible help form Big Bang theory creation. Ground controllers Goddard Space Flight Center finally make contact today two main antennas $1.5 billion hubble Space Telescope try six hours lock on. Applause erupt Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md., glitch mar Hubble's first full day space solved. We confirmation achieve communication track Data Relay Satellite high-gain antenna system, say NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers say along believe antennas work right problem incorrectly point either satellite TDRS, orbit communications satellite acts switchboard. In successful attempt, nearly double width antennas' beams take territory, sweep 6.2 degrees 10.8 degrees. The telescope's low-gain antennas, receive transmit information much slow rate use emergencies, work well. Space shuttle Discovery 46 miles away, available remedy certain problems. The outage problem space walkers would summoned. The five astronauts otherwise busy make pictures storms Texas 380-mile-high perch, experiments. Steve Terry, director team calibrate various aspects telescope, say first outage cause human error serious problem. It begin 1 1:30 a.m. EDT last 45 minutes hour, said. The second failure occur 6:44 a.m. controllers attempt send signal telescope's two high-gain antennas TDRS. This time point problem, say Jim Elliott, Goddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft think inexperience deal cause. The telescope, embark 15-year search new worlds, release shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minute snag almost send two astronauts emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awaken crew early today loud rendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite. good morning, Discovery. I guess awake song, say Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There lot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday Hubble good night asleep. We appreciate good words everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently back Discovery away telescope put shuttle series maneuvers, last one complete morning, park Discovery orbit 46 miles behind Hubble. The telescope really look great flew away it, sure hope good work, Shriver say Wednesday. Well, sure now, Loren, thanks great work done, reply Mission Control. Galileo real proud you. Scientists hail hubble NASA's expensive unman spacecraft great advance astronomy since Galileo raise small telescope eyes nearly 400 years ago. Discovery five astronauts follow telescope controllers Goddard center make sure Hubble operate properly, respond directional commands. The next milestone Friday, telescope's 10-foot aperture door opened, expose finely polish 94.5-inch mirror starlight. then Tuesday, NASA expect release first image telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina. Data follow month two. If aperture door open properly, Discovery could return telescope two astronauts could perform spacewalk fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik say telescope would test today ability maneuver aperture door opened. We want full control ever endanger hubble put aperture door close sunlight, said. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitive instruments. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley use shuttle's 50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope hoist cargo bay. One telescope's solar arrays unreel mast expect start provide power telescope's batteries, otherwise eight hours charge. But trouble second panel. It budge latches released, move fifth 39-foot length stop again. The panel roll way third attempt. By final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan space suits airlock, 30 minutes away take tools hand go outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik say cause problem unknown. The 8{-hour procedure perform 380 miles earth, 70 miles higher shuttle ever flown. The orbit dictate need put Hubble Earth's distort atmosphere. Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost begin time, study stars galaxies distant light take 14 billions years reach Earth. They hope determine universe formed, currently estimate 15 billion years ago. The telescope originally schedule launch 1983 delay technical problems Challenger accident. Discovery, blast orbit Tuesday, schedule land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven years late, hubble Space Telescope belongs, world search others distant may form begin time. Less five hours ride space aboard shuttle Discovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope send first test radio signal. At sign life, applause cheers erupt Mission Control Houston. As near tell, everything looks perfect, say astronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesday drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space. Discovery, trail arc white smoke brilliant blue sky, carry silver-colored telescope orbit 380 miles earth high 70 miles previous shuttle. There hubble stay search yet-unseen wonders creation instruments look 14 billion years backward time. Our window universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exult Discovery rise seaside launch pad. It's beautiful day Hubble Space Telescope orbit instead Earth like many years, say NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's element I'm delighted. The telescope suppose launched 1983, technical problems Challenger accident delay deployment. It suffer delay two weeks ago countdown stop four-minutes-to-go point faulty hydraulic unit shuttle. While remain Earth, telescope cost $7 million month exercise keep readiness. In first day space, checkout test continue remotely control Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland. On hand watch Discovery launch contingent scientists hail hubble great advance astronomy since Galileo raise small telescope eyes nearly 400 years ago. truly referred early-day astronomer ask long delays get telescope work station. Somebody day said, `who remembers day Galileo pick telescope look stars?' say Truly, former shuttle astronaut. It matter day launch Hubble, matters right. The telescope 43 feet long 14 feet diameter, size railroad tank car. When flies free, receive electrical power six scientific instruments two wing-like solar arrays extend outward side. It name late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, theorize universe expand far away galaxy is, faster traveling. That give support theory massive explosion Big Bang create universe 10 20 billion years ago. The Hubble expect help provide answer two major questions: How old universe? How big it? The telescope two mirrors, one 94.5 inches diameter, 12 inches. Two instruments cameras, two spectrometers one photometer. In addition, fine point system act sixth instrument provide precise measurement distances. On Wednesday, Hawley grapple 12{-ton telescope shuttle's mechanical arm, lift cargo bay, point it, long checkout drop overboard orbit own. In cargo bay, telescope receive electrical power shuttle. But juice cut instrument lift depend internal batteries solar panels extend receive light sun. Should solar panels deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan stand by, partially dress space suits, ready go open cargo bay unfurl arrays manually. Discovery's launch without problems. With 31 seconds leave countdown, computer run final moments liftoff refuse close fuel valve stop launch process. The problem overcome shuttle lift 8:34 a.m. EDT, three minutes late. The shuttle schedule land Sunday 9:49 a.m. EDT Edwards Air Force Base California. On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, shuttle's windshield splatter several flecks things. He say windshield streak debris also smear spent booster rockets fell climb orbit. The astronauts also problems UHF radio circuit, one ship's small rear thrusters inoperative. Neither problem consider serious. The shuttle put hubble Space Telescope orbit also carry instrument use 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble: eyepiece world's powerful telescope. It's great pleasure something historical significance something directly symbolize Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan say Friday circle Earth space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope carry orbit Sullivan. After brings eyepiece back Earth, place display observatory. It's basically symbolic gesture past astronomy future astronomy, say Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman Mount Wilson Institute. The pasadena-based group run observatory, locate San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. The discoveries make hubble 100-inch telescope Mount Wilson give us giant leap forward understand universe, McAfee said. We believe hubble Space Telescope thing. The Hooker Telescope world's powerful telescope construction 1918 1948, 200-inch Hale Telescope place operation Mount Palomar Observatory northeast San Diego. Using Hooker Telescope, Hubble first determine distance galaxy outside Milky Way, institute say statement. This crucial discovery provide first definite proof galaxies exist far beyond confines local galaxy, institute said. During 1920s 1930s, hubble assistant use Hooker telescope take thousands photographs faint galaxies, show move away quickly.

There it successfully released the $1.5 billion dollar Hubble Space Telescope from its cargo bay.  Now in the process of overcoming some start-up problems, the telescope should soon be operational.","The shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth, it will provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled.  Once released, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  However, scientists, optimistic that the Hubble will soon be operational, authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return home.","Following an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  Named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who did pioneering work leading to the ""Big Bang"" concept of the universe, it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime, it will provide astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.  The telescope was placed on special flight modes until these start-up problems are resolved.

Disappointed with the postponement, traders sold with a vengeance driving equity prices to a 13-month low with the BSE index down to 2,287 on March 10 compared to 2,893 on February 27. Then the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accused the BSE of violating regulations limiting speculative investments.

Last week, the Securities and Exchange Board of India completed its first inspection of the books and accused the market of ignoring and failing to enforce rules.  This is just the latest dispute between the government and the troubled BSE.  The Indian market already had fallen 48 percent since early last year, aggravated by a negative reaction to the Indian budget, which helped foreign and expatriate investors, but did not provide the expected tax relief to local industry.  On Friday afternoon, the BSE, along with other Bombay commercial centers, was hit with car bombs.  These attacks struck at the heart of India's commerce, seemingly aimed at undermining government efforts to expand foreign investment and tourism.  While a militant Sikh group claimed responsibility, Indian officials still suspect Moslem extremists, maybe with Pakistani help, seeking revenge for the December 1992 destruction of a mosque in northern India.  The BSE was able to resume limited trading on Monday and the index rose for two days.

Fifteen months late, voters Christchurch round Tories malignant squeaky fury. In reality, politicians, Major, far candid salty chat private speaking public. In public, careful say, utterances achieve horrible mattness. But private relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words become nonsensical. They swear joke shout. It really spectacle.

Chauncey, play Peter Sellers, utters mundane sentiments halt monotone convinces Republican party's power brokers sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seem hear want believe. He deadly innocence. No wonder Majors like film. John Major must, level, appreciate similarity own, strangely intangible, rise Chauncey's. If see similarity, still revealing. Do protest urban John Major could identify gardener. In interview Farmers Weekly, days ago, Major disclose unknown fact: father farmer. Farmers Weekly, see, ask Major 'such obvious empathy agriculture'. (Well, obvious Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father farmer. He live small farm somewhere Shropshire.'

After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift.

Social, cultural psychological reasons play part. Socially, 1890s read public vastly homogenous group today: small number middle class authors write middle class audience time literate belong elite. The idea two-tier, down-market, fiction irrelevant. Culturally, writers readers certain place mainstream, novel political intellectual forum.

Today du Maurier would sell Hollywood BBC. The fantasy element fiction, identify characters know them, answered 19th century novel; 20th century tv soaps. Just tabloid newspapers feature characters EastEnders, Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop run serial widespread press speculation whether Little Nell would die, readers write beg saved.

Both In Year Jubilee Esther Waters, example, centre burn 1890s debate marriage, feminism 'New Woman', yet also tearjerkers everyone enjoyed. The 1894 books compel prefigure times yet set back them. Trilby tale hypnotism unconscious decade away Freud; The Ebb Tide pave way Conrad's Heart Darkness first question colonial oppression.

But, tragic sink Estonia loss 800 lives demonstrates, go toll human life high. As ferries increase size, numbers board risk mechanical failure crew error go up. The move roll-on roll-off ferries vehicle decks run entire length vessel increase risk that, sea penetrate hold bow doors gash ship's side, lead vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) members, ship-owning nations, devote much think past two decades ship safety. But sink Estonia lead new review ferry safety. Particularly worrying eyewitness reports suggest water penetrate bow doors manner reminiscent sinking Herald Free Enterprise 1987. Unlike Herald, Estonia appear doors closed, ro-ros undoubtedly vulnerable water penetration. Any review ferry safety focus three main issues. First subject ferry design reconsidered. Additional stability could provide addition sponsons, stabilise bulges project ship's side water line. Greater resistance influx water could obtain instal moveable barriers bulkheads break large car decks. These proposals look british government wake sinking Herald Free Enterprise. It calculate would cost Pounds 70m Pounds 85m improve standards 57 vessels UK ferry fleet, Pounds 22m extra annual run costs. high costs would inevitably lead high fares - unwelcome ferry operators when, short cross-channel routes, face competition Channel tunnel. But difficulty push fare rises would nothing like damage ferry companies another disaster. Second, IMO national governments must look closely improve enforcement exist regulations. The IMO try move enforcement agenda, depend good professionalism governments shipowners. Third, IMO give support national governments campaign, launch yesterday, improve crew training. much regulation recent years concentrate improve ship equipment. Above all, new regulation turn necessary, must introduce speedily. As things stand, take years changes ratify enough governments give force. The European Union, Sweden Finland get ready join, could take lead speed process. Ship safety not, course, issue ferry sector. Five (small) ferries lose last year, accord Lloyd's Register. But figure pales insignificance compare 96 general cargo ships 12 tankers also go down. When cargo vessel third-world crew go distant ocean, little attention paid. If loss relatively modern passenger vessel european waters make ship safety high priority governments public, small compensation loss life Estonia.

The quake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale and exacted particularly heavy casualties since it occurred when most people were inside asleep and hit a coastal area of loosely deposited soil that shifts, causing the adobe homes in the area to collapse. The Iranian President appealed for international aid from all countries except Israel and South Africa. Countries around the world, both friendly and hostile to Iran's Islamic government, responded quickly. The aid from the United States, including funds and supplies raised by Iranians in California , was channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This was a rare example of U.S.-Iranian cooperation after the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Countries as diverse as Egypt, China, India, Malaysia and the Soviet Union sent help. Even Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born author of ""Satanic Verses,"" condemned to death by the Iranian ayatollahs, contributed $8,600. All was not sweetness and light, however. In Iran an anti-American newspaper blamed the high death toll on the United States and in Washington Iranian opposition leaders blamed it on the Iranian government.","Devastating earthquake kills up to 55,000 in mountainous northern Iran.","An earthquake in northern Iran Thursday morning killed as many as 55,000 and injured thousands more.

Although the United States broke diplomatic ties with Iran in 1979, Washington was arranging to provide humanitarian relief through the American Red Cross and other U.S. agencies. Iran has said it would welcome such supplies. An opposition group as accused the Iranian government underestimating the number of casualties and of devoting all of its resources to a war with Iran rather than providing adequate housing. On the other hand, an anti-American newspaper in Iran said the U.S. was partly to blame because it caused the Iranians to divert needed cash fromHousing projects and building earthquake resistant buildings.

The international community start look beyond conflict former Yugoslavia, become increasingly aware true magnitude seriousness ethnic political conflicts former soviet Union. The problem indeed press one. The disputes Transcaucasus, central Asia, elsewhere former Soviet Union cause great suffer involved. They source legitimate concern Russians, worry clashes close borders. They concern safety ethnic Russians live countries conflicts, economic social consequences refugees flee Russia (whose potential number estimate 2m). They believe problems former soviet republics either ignore misunderstood. The Russians fear nothing, conflicts worsen probably spread. They argue legitimate concern try resolve conflicts threaten security. They ask why, international community engage peacemaking peacekeeping many world's trouble spots, similar efforts undertaken hot spots near them. Equally, disputes legitimate concern Britain, western partners whole international community, humanitarian reasons flashpoints risk provoke regional instability. If uncontrolled, pose variety threats european security, include increase traffic drugs arms well international terrorism. Crises Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations west: unless carefully handled, risk prejudice emerge relationship us.

Nor countries secure independence Soviet Union dissolve keen west concede Moscow role play soviet empire. They fear would compromise sovereignty. When willing russian troops play peacekeeping role, want form international monitoring. This meant that, even though west lacks resources engage directly trouble spots, wary appear endorse russian involvement instead, case imperial tendencies. If fashion joint approach Russia western partners problem peacekeeping former soviet Union, must address concerns. Clearly Russia important role play area. If Russians want international recognition active support international community, west turn needs guarantees Russia regard recognition involvement give carte blanche former soviet Union.

These principles help stimulate dialogue political settlement parties conflict, focus attention and, possible, resources settlement conflicts former soviet Union. All help enhance russian peacekeeping practices. Although Conference Security Co-operation Europe UN lack resources put large numbers peacekeepers grind themselves, may able suggest measures enhance transparency monitor peace process. Extending co-operation within North Atlantic Co-operation Council, also co-operation Russia Nato, might help improve train russian peacekeepers. This area shall need explore further. We also need put much emphasis preventive diplomacy. One ways help prevent conflicts strengthen democratic institutions newly independent countries former soviet Union. The CSCE international institutions play important role here, draw newly independent countries active dialogue ways promote democratic values principles. We discuss ways strengthen CSCE's role, include role High Commissioner National Minorities, recent Rome ministerial meeting. We must try find ways manage resolve tensions erupt conflict.

Tighter tax laws haven't diminished corporate attendance. In Tampa 1991, the black community shared in the profits.San Francisco has four Vince Lombardi Trophies.","Super Bowl XXIV gave the 49ers their fourth Vince Lombardi Trophy. Sixty-three percent of TV viewers watched the lopsided game which also featured the conclusion of the ""Bud Bowl II,"" a $7 million Anheuser Bush ad campaign. Though the game can spotlight a community's problems, it also has tremendous economic impact. Communities such as Los Angeles--Orange County, therefore, offer incentives, such as rent-free stadium use, to lure the game to their city. Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

In Guatemala, a ferry captain was charges with negligent homicide when his boat which was being towed, sank after he failed to steer it.   A ferry sank off the Egyptian coast after inexplicably leaving standard navigational channels and ramming a coral reef in stormy seas.  In that accident, survivors claimed that crewmembers abandoned ship without helping them.  The ship's engineer denied the charges.  Two boats carrying Somali refugees sank off the coast of Kenya, resulting in more than 140 deaths, although the cause of the sinking was not reported. An overcrowded ferry in Bangladesh sank with almost double the passengers it was authorized.  In a separate ferry incident in Bangladesh, pirates robbed passengers and threw six overboard. In the Indian accident, monsoon rains may have contributed as well as overcrowding.  Even an advanced country such as Israel can experience ferry accidents.  Nineteen U.S. sailors died when an Israeli ferry sank while returning the sailors to the USS Saratoga.  No cause was reported."

It hit Charleston head-on with winds of 135 mph and then proceeded northwestward hitting other population centers rather than heading up the coast or out to sea as expected. Fortunately Hurricane forecasters analyzing computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane made an accurate educated guess as to the point of landfall in time for threatened residents to evacuate. As a result, only 17 deaths resulted in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston which took the brunt of the storm.

The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,

A study Mercedes-Benz find 42% family heads make $40,000 year jog regularly. Of potential buyers show Mercedes dealers, 47% joggers. With numbers mind, car maker become sponsor three marathons -- New York, Boston Los Angeles -- well run races. Marathons corporate backing time. But Los Angeles ahead pack make distance run commercial spectacle. The city invent corporate-sponsored Olympics create marathon unlike others -- artfully dress olympic-type amateur race, build ground make money closely hold company control -- well city. ""I take air make event,"" say William Burke, founder president Los Angeles Marathon Inc. For man whose running days end high school track team, Mr. Burke turn lot heads world marathoning. last year, first time out, Los Angeles race attract nearly 11,000 runners -- four times number forecast enough make third -- large race U.S. The event also pull $4 million cash services sponsors, leave organizers $370,000 red ink. This year, Mr. Burke partner, Marie Patrick, expect gross $5 million cash services break even. Next year, say, profit possible. more 18,000 runners expect year. An audience perhaps million half line route, draw part advertisements 75 million coca-cola cans 2,500 billboards around Los Angeles area. market experts say festive atmosphere big crowd streets make marathons attractive sponsors. For cost 30-second ad Super Bowl, company sponsor marathon ""take city,"" say Lesa Ukman, editor special Events Reports, chicago-based newsletter. The Los Angeles organizers sponsors perhaps do counterparts elsewhere publicize event. Los Angelenos see plugs race millions grocery bags, milk cartons loaves bread, addition soda cans, billboards sources. The venerable New York Marathon take note. The New York Road Runners Club, organizer race, stop promote event years ago runners wanted. Now, Fred Lebow, group's president, say encouraging sponsors promote race Los Angeles sponsors do. The promotion Los Angeles unabashed. ""We tell people they're look new way crack Los Angeles market, it,"" say Mr. Burke. The pitch attract likes Coca-Cola Bottling Co.

""We buy kind exposure normally,"" say Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director. Ellesse, also sponsor New York run, find West Coast event freewheeling. ""They let us whatever want,"" say Ms. Cialone. For instance, product banners along route -- almost impossible arrange New York -- snap Los Angeles. The city, fact, partner race.

And like Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portray race civic celebration, thrives volunteers. Some 7,500 people work free monitor course race day. And two-thirds race's office staff work without pay. ""I buy this,"" Mr. Burke says, gesture around crowd race headquarters. not everyone work free. big-name runners, instance, want pay lot. And here, organizers pinch pennies. While runners pay appear, year's field, like last year's, lack superstars race Boston, New York London. Grete Waitz, one best woman marathoners, want $100,000 appear Los Angeles; turn down. Mr. Burke say australian runner Rob de Castella make know agent run marathons spring but, $25,000, he'd happy say Los Angeles event tempting. Mr. Burke say slam phone. ""We spend extraordinary amounts money single runner detriment runners,"" says. Mr. de Castella's agent deny story entirely. What Los Angeles lack superstars, plans make numbers. This year's race may challenge New York London large marathon ever run. Some 20,500 start New York race last year. Mr. Lebow, organizer New York event, say next year's Los Angeles Marathon surpass number. For one sponsor, may mix blessing.

She added:i'm sure sun shin straight down, Jesse's watch us,too.the 1984 Summer Olympic Games even advertisers begin clamor pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton. She go grin relentlessly $5 million worth commercial endorsements -- surely Olympic record itself. But 1988 Summer Games end Sunday night, so, too, chance american athletes follow footsteps. Ad agency executives, spend every fourth year glue TV sets, hop pick next star hawk clients' products, say Olympiad dud. ""i suspect go dull history Olympics,"" say Jerry Della Femina, chairman ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS. ""This first Olympics without passion, without passion testimonials. Without heroes, anyone anyone want emulate."" On surface, Games seem offer drama usually make lucrative endorsement contracts. Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smack head springboard, come back win two gold medals? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, two-inch fingernails rake air 100-meter sprint? But even two, along Jackie Joyner-Kersee, women's heptathalon long jump, may find difficult previous years turn gold medals gold bank. The fact is, say many marketers, Olympic gold lose much commercial luster. ""I think big money like use be,"" say Michael Goldberg National Media Group Inc., New York sports-marketing firm represent Ms. Retton. ""It use kind knee-jerk reaction ad campaign around Olympic athlete. It happen anymore."" Certainly, year's win Olympians trouble secure contracts specialize sports-equipment outfitters speak invitations obscure trade groups. But major, high-paying endorsements -- soft-drink companies fast-food outlets -- seem surfacing, least yet. Earlier year, sports marketers estimate gold medal Summer Games could earn personable athlete $1 million endorsements. Now, marketers say, medalists lucky pull $100,000 $500,000 year. Advertisers reel litany reasons Olympics ignite much spark. For one thing, suffer comparison 1984 Summer Games, excite hold Los Angeles because, absence boycott Soviet-bloc countries, Americans 83 gold medals. The 1988 Games, contrast, broadcast halfway around world, Soviets trounce Americans, 55 gold medals 36. What's more, marketers say, year's drug scandals cast pall Games, especially incident involve canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, lose gold medal test positive steroids. NBC's tv coverage also get share blame. Marketers say bland skip frequently one event another little chance excitement build. The constant commercial interruptions, lead ratings much low expected, help, either. During past Games, ""there enough continuous tv coverage that, much like soap opera, possible get involve lives competition,"" say Leigh Steinberg, attorney ice-skater Brian Boitano, gold medalist 1988 Winter Games. But summer, says. Recent changes Olympic rules, meanwhile, lead glut Olympians search endorsement deals. Before 1984 Games, Olympic athletes allow make commercials unless give amateur status. Now, appear many ads want, income must go trust fund training expenses. ""every year, more olympic people want commercials -- basically, everybody available,"" say Daisy Sinclair, vice president ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As result, ""aura"" surround Olympian, ""the bloom off."" Companies also become sophisticated approach celebrity endorsements. increasingly cost conscious, longer hook olympian company president likes athlete's sport. And years pay big bucks olympic stars see fade obscurity, companies finally get hint olympian fame fleet variety. ""if think phone ring hook (you win) gold medal, go happen anymore,"" say Stephen Disson, senior vice president marketing ProServ Inc., Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies know ""six months heroes sport events"" consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude toward Olympics become typical. It use sports stars commercials Pepsi Light Oppenheimer Mutual Funds plan call 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer use athletes public eye regular basis, like football basketball players,"" say Charles Miesmer, agency's executive creative director. ""People like Michael Jordan 10-plus years sports careers, row, I worry public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And look 1988's winners start show Wheaties boxes, either. General Mills Inc., feature Ms. Retton decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner Wheaties boxes past, say look three qualities endorser: career achievement, popular appeal off-the-field accomplishments. A spokeswoman say none year's crop meet three criteria. so far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee visible endorsements. even Olympics began, make commercials Primatene mist 7-up. And, accord agent, Pearl Hodge World Class Management, ""in process"" sign McDonald's Corp., work behalf efforts aid underprivileged children. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take endorsement lead. Advertisers say good looks fashion flare, attract interest medal winners. (The sprinter's manager reach comment.) Another olympian endorsement potential swimmer Matt Biondi, five gold medals. Mr. Biondi already sign swim-wear contract Arena USA Inc., Parkes Brittain, agent Advantage International Inc., say client ""will definitely high-income ring, high name."" then Mr. Louganis. Since win two gold medals 1984 Summer Olympics, diver little luck major endorsements. And marketing executives say even second sweep dive events may potential. ""when advertisers look male hero, word 'macho' trails along closely,"" say Marty Blackman Blackman & Raber, sports-marketing firm New York. ""I find Louganis macho guy."" Still, marketing professionals say Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery smash head secure diver's future. His manager, Jim Babbitt, comment contract offers. He say, however, client ""done fine.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing groupof runners in those events.In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured manysuccessful Olympic athletes.",,,,

Satellites, computers, and reconnaissance planes helped forecasters monitor Hugo's progress. Insurance claims broke records. The greenhouse effect could raise future storms' destructive power by 50%.","Category 4 Hurricane Hugo did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean on Sep 17, 1989, and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo. Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.",Hurricane Hugo Could Have Been Deadlier. Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing. Scientists predict that if  sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.",,,,

It quickly overran the Kuwaiti capital and then continued on to southern oil facilities.  The United States led the United Nations in condemning this action and imposing tough economic and military sanctions.","Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions by exceeding OPEC production quotas thus driving down oil prices.  He further accused Kuwait of ""stealing"" Iraqi oil from a common oil field on their border.  He then invaded Kuwait, claiming to do so at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  The United States led the western world and the United Nations in calling the coup a sham, denouncing this invasion and imposing strong economic and military sanctions on Iraq in an attempt to get them to withdraw.  Oil prices surged while Saddam warned against foreign intervention.  The U.S. dispatched warships to the area.","It appeared that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his countries financial problems and territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  Iraq emerged from its 1980-1988 war with Iran with a debt of approximately $80 billion.  Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions in oil revenues by exceeding OPEC assigned oil quotas, thus driving down the price of oil.  He further accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from an oil field common to their border and also of conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq economically and militarily.  Breaking off perfunctory negotiations with Kuwait, Iraq invaded, claiming it responded to a request for help from Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  Iraq quickly overwhelmed a mismatched Kuwaiti military, captured the capital and continued south to the oil facilities.  The United States called the coup a farce.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador asked the United States to intervene militarily.  U.S. President George Bush called for an ""immediate and unconditional"" withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  Although not willing to publicly discuss military options, Bush said all U.S. options remained open.  His administration led a United Nations embargo of Iraqi exports, including oil, and Iraqi imports.  Iraq retaliated by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait.",Saddam Hussein Defied United States and United Nations,"On August 2, 1990, after Saddam Hussein had charged Kuwait with unfriendly acts, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic moves by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq remained defiant and moved troops toward the Saudi Arabian border. As of August 6, 1990 the situation was ominous.","In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border. The two countries agreed to talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives walked out. The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of them to Iraq. As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.","On July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPECproduction quotas and of stealing oil from wells along the countries'disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a""short-notice exercise"" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would notbe intimidated by U.S. pressure. Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwaitagreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq hadmassed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. The next day Iraq pulledout of the talks and on August 2,1990 invaded and quickly occupied allof Kuwait. President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blockedmost Iraqi imports. The U.N. Security Council denounced the invasionand demanded Iraq's withdrawal. The Pentagon stepped up air patrolsand movement of warships into the Persian Gulf. When, on August 6, theU.S.  pushed strong sanctions against Iraq through the U.N. SecurityCouncil, Iraq struck back, rounding up several hundred Britons,Americans, and West Germans in Kuwait, taking some of them toIraq. Iraqi troop concentrations menaced the Saudi Arabian border andthe U.S. warned Iraq of vital American interests in Saudi Arabia, butas of August 6, 1990 it was a stand-off. Iraq was in possession ofKuwait and oil prices soared on the international market.",,,,

At start study, averagecholesterol levels 251. The surgery lower people'scholesterol 23 percent.the overall risk die heart disease sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack reduce 35 percent among thesurgical patients healthy hearts. The surgical patientsalso require less half many coronary bypass operationsbecause clogged heart arteries.new treatments stop heart attack itstracks may help victims get hospital quicklythan ever before, perhaps even three days attacks, astudy publish today concludes.Doctors University Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effects send carefully select heart patients homeearly. They find people unusual complications,got back work sooner substantially low medical bills.it extraordinarily safe strategy, say Dr. Eric J.Topol, study's director. There problems anyserious events.Topol say early discharges make possible two recentmedical advances tissue plasminogen activator, TPA, andangioplasty.when give quickly heart attack, TPA dissolve clotsin heart's arteries minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar results open clogged arteries withtiny balloons.the report represent late steady three-decade trendof send heart attack patients home hospital evershorter stays.however, study New England Journal Medicine saidmore research need findings widely adopted.in 1950s, doctors often recommend patients stay inbed one two months heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffer uncomplicated heart attack in1955, spend seven weeks recover hospital.however, doctors learn long inactivity harm thangood. Patients get shape, develop blood clots becamedemoralized.in 1960s, stay shorten three weeks the1970s two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalize seven 10 days.in paper, doctors determine 80 507 heartattack patients study healthy enough consider forearly discharge. none irregular heart beats, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill test show signs heart attackdamage.forty patients send home three days, reststayed seven 10 days. After six months followup, none haddied, number medical problems groups similar.however, people early discharge group able returnto work two weeks sooner others, medicalbills significantly low $12,546 versus $17,868.The researchers estimate 15 percent heart attackpatients discharge three days, annual save wouldbe least $280 million.in accompany editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, deputyeditor journal, caution study largeenough spot complications might result reducinghospital stays.this single study, wrote, sufficient justifysweeping changes current management practices patientswho may first appear uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors cautious prescribe aspirin preventer heart attacks research support value, Food Drug Administration said. take aspirin prevent heart attacks may increase people's chances die things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, agency say commentary today's Journal American Medical Association. The FDA persuade aspirin makers March refrain promote aspirin preventer first heart attacks, least now. A study publish January indicate aspirin every day reduce risk nonfatal, first heart attack 47% 11,000 male doctors five years, compare 11,000 take non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tend promote bleed reduce ability blood platelets help form clots. Heart attack usually occur clots form arteries nourish heart choke blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risks people already clot problems, high blood pressure, put increase risk hemorrhagic strokes, FDA commentary said. Strokes result brain damage cause bleed brain blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes cause bleeding. The FDA commentary point 10 hemorrhagic strokes record among 11,000 subjects take aspirin recent study, compare two strokes among 11,000 subjects take substitute. overall death rates two groups same, though aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate much lower. There 104 nonfatal heart attacks among aspirin users 189 comparison group. ""Physicians, will, time, force make professional judgments aspirin use basis incomplete information,"" say FDA commentary, co-written agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree completely,"" say Dr. Julie Buring, Harvard University researcher participate aspirin study. She add telephone interview yesterday extension study way, researchers expect report FDA late fall. The commentary note british study, also release January, 5,000 male physicians find aspirin failed protect heart attacks, associate 2 1/2-fold increase disable strokes.a drug use treat patients complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recur heart attacks infour five heart patients, accord study publish intoday's edition New England Journal Medicine.Surprisingly, however, study find drug, diltiazem,increases chance subsequent heart attack patients whosehearts pump abnormally, experts said.even so, results may trigger increase use thedrug, primarily use treat angina, doctors said.the drug test 38 hospitals United States andcanada patients recently suffer heart attack, saiddr. Arthur Moss, clinical professor medicine Universityof Rochester principal investigator study.the results suggest drug may quite effective indecreasing likelihood second heart attack majorityof patients, Moss said. But study also surprisingly suggeststhat patients suffer pulmonary congestion givendiltiazem drug increases chance subsequentheart attack.we know prescribe drug to,Moss said. That's study about.diltiazem calcium entry blocker, new class drugsto introduce fight heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blockers types commonly prescribe doctors.the study involve 2,466 heart attack patients, giveneither 240 milligrams diltiazem day placebo. Patientswere recruit 1983 1986 follow 12 52 months.overall, drug decrease additional heart attack 11percent, statistically significant, Moss said.but patients normal near-normal heart pumpfunction 1,909 patients 80 percent total group diltiazem decrease chance another heart attack 25percent, Moss said.in patients whose hearts pump problems, drug onlydidn't help, increase chance heart attack 25percent.Dr. John Schroeder, cardiologist professor StanfordUniversity, say surprised drug increase thechance heart attack group overall results werenot higher.but bottom line first study showthat diltiazem effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean patients routinely put drug ona long-term basis.dr. George Beller, cardiologist professor theuniversity Virginia, say also somewhat surprise aboutthe increase heart attacks group suffer pulmonarycongestion.This one first reports seem identifythat, said.diltiazem two calcium entry blockers introducedin past decade, Beller said, research effectivethey various applications early stages.Nitrates use 50 years, betablockers develop 1960s.Aspirin sales jump 41 percent weeksearlier year, rash headaches.a study 22,000 male doctors show take asingle aspirin every day could cut heart attack risk half.the study one series recent reports show thefirst time doctors able treat heart attacks also prevent them.in recent report, doctors find one aspirin tabletand single dose clot-dissolving drug give within 24 hourscan dramatically cut risk second fatal heart attack.Without treatment, patients 13 percent chance dyingfrom second heart attack within five weeks, researchersfound. With treatment, figure drop 8 percent.the real discovery treatment patients go toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, say Richard Peto ofoxford University, one study's authors.heart disease nation's lead cause death, far.the National Center Health Statistics report 762,820Americans died heart disease 1987.To put another way: Of 2,127,000 american die thatyear, one three die heart disease.

But begin change.some doctors predict not-too-distant future thesedrugs judge safe administeredroutinely paramedics ambulances suspect heart attackvictims even reach hospital.We know respond quickly, havethe courage use drugs absence definitivediagnosis, say Dr. Burton Sobel Washington University St.Louis, pioneer test clot-dissolvers.the important thing teach patients inadvance value early treatment, says.while public attention focus new ability toprevent heart attacks, researchers also make importantprogress speeding recovery patients survive heartattacks.Researchers University Michigan recently determinedthat heart attack victims release hospital assoon three days heart attacks. most heart attacksvictims kept hospital least seven 10 days.the patients give early discharge able return worktwo weeks sooner others study group. After six months,not one death record early-discharge group. Theresearchers conclude perhaps 15 percent heart attacksvictims could safely discharge three days.in July, Stanford University doctors find workers wentback jobs seven weeks heart attack didat least well workers go back typicalconvalescence 10 11 weeks.all advances come time public health expertsare increasingly emphasizing role good health goodnutrition lower heart disease risk.early next year, American Heart Association seal approvalwill begin appear foods low fat cholesteroland therefore help reduce heart disease risk.u.s. Surgeon General C.

Thus, bymeasuring loss substance, researchers coulddetermine amount heart damage.lefer say TGF beta seem block action othersubstances, tumor necrosis factor, cause bloodvessels narrow follow heart attack. Narrowed blood vesselscarry less oxygen-rich blood cells cause additionalinjury follow heart attack.tgf beta normally present heart cells, studypublished Science say miss rat heart cellsdamaged simulated heart attack.Though TGF beta produce naturally body, Lefer saidhis research team use substance produce artificially bygenentech, California biotechnology firm.lefer say team conduct additional studies withtgf beta experimental treatment human heart attackvictims substance least year away.jefferson Medical College, study done, part ofThomas Jefferson University Philadelphia.Science, publish study, journal theamerican Association Advancement Science.The experiment also hint blood urine test,which measure activity blood protein call renin,might suggest new ""risk factor"" heart attacks.

Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

Most airmen, dependents and civilian employees were evacuated to the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay on the 11th, following the first major eruption. The remaining personnel left a day or two later.

Meanwhile vigorous lobbying of the entire Senate by pro- and anti-Thomas groups proceeded.","From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Thomas's refusal to answer certain questions caused complaints, but it appeared early on that the committee would approve the nomination. By the end of the questioning an affirmative vote of 10-4 or 9-5 was predicted. There was media attention to Thomas's wife Virginia. A successful Washington lawyer, she had taken strong conservative positions that antagonized certain groups and the fact that she was white and he black raised questions for some blacks. During the hearings lobbyists on either side worked to influence the ensuing vote of the full Senate.","From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, underwent five days of intensive questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Although it seemed likely that the committee would vote to confirm the nomination, some members complained that the candidate refused to answer certain questions and seemed to back away from statements that he had made in the past. By the end of the questioning it appeared that Thomas would be confirmed by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote. In the media Thomas's wife Virginia was presented as an issue. Virginia had an impressive career as a lawyer in Washington, often taking strong conservative positions. She is white while Clarence is black. Women's-rights activists objected to her opposition to comparable-worth legislation; some religious groups were wary of her anti-cult activities; and some blacks viewed the Thomases' marriage as indicating his rejection of the black community. Throughout the hearings the entire Senate came under pressure from groups supporting or opposing the nomination.

Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories. The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers. In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.  Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting. On average a best picture award is worth about $20 million, but there is no guarantee that Academy members actually complete their own ballots.Millions watch the awards presentation. The last awards show took a long three plus hours. The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character. Though long, the 1989 ceremony will be favorably remembered for the spread of the awards. Ten movies split 17 awards. The Oscar, created in 1928, is one of the most recognizable symbols in the entertainment world and is not protected by copyright.

Oscar shows have been criticized for their excesses of commercialism, production numbers, and meaningless awards.  In 1989, Disney sued the academy for opening the program with a Snow White routine. The academy closely protects the Oscar's name and image. It sued when a film festival award and an employee-incentive trophy were too similar, but a federal judge ruled that the statuette had no copyright protection. The academy has also tried to block the sale of statuettes. The Oscar, manufactured by Chicago's R.S. Owens Co., weighs 8 pounds and stands 13 inches tall. It is made of Britannia metal and plated with copper, nickel, and gold.",,,,

Large crowds stood in line for hours atopenings in Belgrade, Moscow, and Peking. Customers in Yugoslavia, the firstcommunist country to get a McDonald's, and China raved about the taste of the Big Mac.In Moscow, the Russians were less enthusiastic about its taste but gave a thumbs up tothe shakes. The openings came after long negotiations which, in most cases, sawMcDonald's contracting with local farmers for the beef, potatoes and other suppliesneeded for its restaurants.","McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets. After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.  To participate in Asia's fastest expanding economy, came their first restaurant in South Korea.  Moving into communist countries, its opening in Belgrade, Yugoslavia was followed by a record shattering opening of its largest outlet anywhere in Moscow.  Then came Shenzhan, McDonald's first foray into China.","To capitalize on Asia's fastest-growing economy McDonald's opened its first outlet in South Korea.  Moving into communist countries, on March 24, 1988 it opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  There to compete with the locally favored ""pljeskavica"", a pork and onion sandwich, initial reaction was favorable.  Two years later came its largest outlet to date.  In Moscow thousands lined up for an opening day record of 30,000 meals being served at 27 cash registers.  Next, McDonald's opened in China, where cooking is a culinary art.  McDonald's worldwide restaurants are joint ventures with locals of the country in which they operate.","""Golden Arches"" continues its worldwide expansion.  In 1988, seven years after its first attempt to bring a restaurant to South Korea, McDonald's successfully joint-ventured with Ahn Hyo Young, a Harvard schooled entrepreneur. McAhn Enterprises Ltd. had to fight government red tape and develop local suppliers in order to open in Seoul.  That year, Big Mac also braved the communist world.  On March 24, 1988, McDonald's successfully opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  Its local competition was the hamburger-like pljeskavica, i.e., ground pork and onion served on bread and eaten by hand.  Two years later, McDonald's had their most successful opening ever, worldwide.  In Pushkin Square, Moscow, thousands of people waited in line for hours at the largest McDonald's in the world for hamburgers, fries and shakes.  This opening day ""Mac attack"" resulted in 30,000 meals being served over fourteen hours at 27 cash registers.  Customers were surprised and pleased to find efficient, friendly workers in this country of generally surly service.  And then, China, where cooking is a culinary art.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.  All European and Jewish issues were addressed.  Reunification occurred.",East's Economy Sagging. Soviets Endorse German Reunification. World Awaits Change,"Woeful economic conditions and massive demonstrations in East Germany gave impetusto German reunification. Soviet endorsement of reunification in 1990 made it imminent.Many perceived a strong unified Germany as a danger, but that was accepted as a lesserthreat than East Germany in turmoil.","East Germany was near chaos by the end of 1989. Woeful economic conditionsprevailed. Massive demonstrations for democratic reform swept the nation. The hard-lineCommunist government admitted its failure, giving strong impetus to the Germanreunification movement. The Soviets endorsed it in February as the World War II Alliesdid later. Unification was now imminent.The specter of an economically and politically powerful Germany disturbed many, butparticularly the Poles, Soviets and world Jewry. Despite concerns, reunification would beaccepted as a lesser threat than a chaotic East Germany.","Through the first three months of 1989, 80,00 East Germans fled their country, andmassive demonstrations raised doubts that Erich Honeker the, hard-line Communistleader could resist the democratic reforms sweeping his country. Street demonstrationsoccurred throughout East Germany in November 1989, and the East German CommunistParty was forced to admit the its system had failed.The West German constitution called for a united Germany, but it received little attentionuntil late 1989. The specter of a powerful undivided Germany troubled many, butparticularly the Soviets and Poles.Matters moved quickly in early 1990. Soviet President Gorbachev gave West Germanyan unequivocal promise that German reunification would be honored. Two days later, onthe 12th of February, said that negotiations with East Germany should begin as soon aspossible after the 18 March East German elections. In time the World War II Allieswould endorse reunification.With reunification imminent, world Jewish leaders asked for guarantees that theHolocaust would not be repeated. Most prominent American historians agreed that astable Germany was a lesser threat to stability than the woeful conditions and near chaosin East Germany.",,,,

Quayle's grandfather owned the newspaper in Quayle's hometown of Huntington. Quayle, known always as a nice guy, graduated from DePauw in 1969, took National Guard training, then in 1971 worked in the Indiana Attorney General's office and for the governor.

Kennedy because of their similar ages and congressional service, and to Robert Redford in appearance. Quayle was criticized as a novice and his National Guard service attacked. His campaign gaffes made news, but he was loyal to Bush and a team player. After controversies subsided he kept a low profile. A year after the election he agreed to be on ""Meet the Press"", shortly after Bush announced he would be on the ticket in 1992, and was uncontroversial. Quayle grew up in Huntington, Indiana, population 17,000, where his grandfather owned the newspaper. He graduated from DePauw University in 1969, spent six months in National Guard training, then in 1971 investigated consumer problems in the Indiana Attorney General's office and became an aide to the governor.

Quayle was viewed as a lightweight and questions wereraised about his military service and errors in his official resume. Hismain attributes were party loyalty and identification as a devoted familyman.  Quayle contributed little to the campaign and, after being elected,all but disappeared from the political scene.  President Bush, however,continued to voice support for, and confidence in Quayle.  His friends,especially in his home town, called him a winner.","George Bush's choice of Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate,surprised most political observers.  Despite service in Congress andSenate, he was looked upon as lacking the experience and mettle for avigorous national campaign.  Several Republican senators rallied support.Senator John Warner of Virginia compared Quayle to Thomas Jefferson.Senator Bob Dole in nominating Quayle at the Republican Convention, calledhim a dedicated public servant and devoted family man and cited his supportfor the Reagan program.Devotion to family and friends was a theme voiced by those who had knownQuayle for many years. Relatives and friends believed that if Quayle wereelected, he and his family would remain a strong unit.Questions arose regarding Quayle's fitness for the job, and there were somesuggestions that he should withdraw.  He had called himself a ""Vietnam-eraveteran"" which angered some actual combat veterans.  Quayle's service was in the National Guard, a position he apparently gained through familyinfluence.

The removal of this symbol of the Cold War was part of an elaborate ceremony attended by the top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies. Appropriate to the occasion, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze backed away from all-out opposition to united Germany's membership in NATO, suggesting that this could take place but only after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave thecountry.","On June 22, 1990 Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was hoisted by a huge crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum. The guardhouse, constructed after erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was the scene of many successful and unsuccessful attempts at escape from East Berlin and had become a symbol of the Cold War. By June of 1990 with the Berlin Wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, and with top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city after unification, U.S. officials decided it was time to remove the famous landmark. The foreign ministers attended an elaborate ceremony to honor the symbolic act. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze took the occasion to modify the previous Soviet firm opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, proposing that such a step be allowed after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. U.S. Secretary of State Baker declared himself ""underwhelmed"" by the offer, but softening of the Soviet position was a welcome sign appropriate to the occasion.",The Cold War ends as Checkpoint Charlie is lifted into history.,"As a U.S. army band played and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, Checkpoint Charlie, the symbol of the Cold War, was lifted into history today.

Secretary of State Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie as a symbol of the Cold War, hoped its removal would bury the conflicts it created. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for a removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city. Checkpoint Charlie became superfluous when the East Germany overthrew its communist-controlled government and the border between East and West Germany was opened. Although the ceremony was closed to the public, residents of the street watched from their windows.","Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous symbol of the Cold War was lifted into history today. At an invitation only ceremony attended by the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies, a U.S. army band played an old Berlin song as the checkpoint was hoisted onto a waiting flatbed truck, to be taken to a museum. Speaking at the ceremony, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for the removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city and the withdrawal of troops six months after the two German states unify. Secretary of State James Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol, expressed the hope that its removal would bury the conflicts it created. The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous. Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany. Among the invited guests was West Germany's Chancellor Willy Brandt who was mayor of Berlin in the 1960s.",,,,
