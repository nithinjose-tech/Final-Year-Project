0,d116i,"Five astronauts board Discovery today second try send hubble Space Telescope orbit scan outermost reaches universe clues begin time. Astronomers be start tingle again anticipation what Hubble will be able accomplish, say Lennard Fisk, head NASA science activities. Air Force forecasters say there be 90 percent chance weather would be favorable launch shuttle schedule time 8:31 a.m. EDT. more half million gallons liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen be pumped space ship's fuel tanks midnight. The astronauts, wear bright orange flight suits, climb crew cabin just dawn be break Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers new set eyes and ears that we don't have, say William Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program. It's go change our perspective altogether. I can't say what we're go learn, I'll be astound if we don't learn many new things. Discovery be aim altitude 380 miles, high shuttle have ever gone, so telescope can be place its proper orbit far Earth's distort atmosphere. It be 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, which journey space next month Astro observatory, sat launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery, only second time pads have be occupied; first be 1986 just Challenger explosion. Hubble have be wait take its place space 1983, delayed technical problems and Challenger accident. The late postponement occur April 10, when Discovery's launch be scrub four minutes liftoff because faulty power unit shuttle. The mood Kennedy Space Center be considerably less festive first launch attempt, when hundreds astronomers gather their families. The day launch, mission specialist Steven a. Hawley will use shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescope space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if problem develops. Discovery will follow hubble 40 miles away two days its lens cap be opened, expose finely polish 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Hubble be not expect start provide scientific data satellite month or more liftoff. However, NASA say it will release its first image open star cluster constellation Carina week launch. In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million have be spend spare parts, astronaut training and computer software operate instrument. The european Space Agency contribute $250 million 15 percent view time. NASA estimate it will cost $200 million year operate and maintain telescope space. During its 15-year working lifetime, telescope will provide astronomers 10 times good resolution and 25 times more sensitivity ground-based observatories. As result, they will be able study stars and galaxies so distant their light have be travel earth 14 billion years. Astronomers hope learn whether universe be create 15 billion years ago believe and uncover some mystery surround galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also be expect shed light how and when universe might end. The telescope be name late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discover 1920s that universe be expanding. His work give rise Big Bang theory that universe be create tremendous explosion. In addition Hubble, Discovery carry human skull fill sensors measure space radiation that astronauts receive. It be skull's third trip space. The shuttle be end its five-day mission landing Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronauts return Sunday second attempt launch shuttle NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery be schedule lift 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. We feel very confident that things be go go well this time, say Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're go come out ok Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep try we do. That's kind name game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach say Sunday that countdown be proceed smoothly and shuttle appeared be perfect condition. The countdown get way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit force first launch attempt be scrub four minutes liftoff April 10. The unit be replace new one, which test show be fine. Hopefully, we'll get shuttle pad this time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance favorable weather be expect launch time, low clouds be main concern, say Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front north be expect pas area Monday night. The outlook be considerably better Wednesday and Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronauts arrive Johnson Space Center Houston early Sunday afternoon, shuttle Columbia be be transport launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery. It be only second time shuttle launch pads Kennedy Space Center have be occupy simultaneously. The first time be January 1986; 16 days Columbia lift off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand say he do not believe National Aeronautics and Space Administration be move too fast his shuttle. NASA expect launch Columbia astronomical observatory call Astro no early May 16, one week later plan because Discovery's two-week delay. In some cases, it could be problem have shuttles launch pads, Brand said. In this particular case, everything's fit together. NASA have Saturday get Discovery ground. After that, all launch attempts must be halt eight days so hubble's batteries can be recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power hubble time it be disconnect Discovery's electrical system its two energy-collecting solar panels take space. Discovery's payload bay be seal late Saturday night, drastically reduce risk contamination telescope's finely polish 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery will aim altitude 380 miles, high shuttle have ever gone, so telescope can be place its proper orbit far Earth's distort atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey space, astronomers expect look back nearly begin time and solve some universe's most perplexing mysteries. Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected Hubble and thus provide additional targets telescope. The $100 million observatory also will focus Columbia's nine-day mission Comet Austin, believe be its first trip solar system. Both Hubble and Astro be schedule launch 1986, be delay Challenger accident. The hubble Space Telescope be awaken its self-induced sleep today it be still use its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments be hold, unable begin any observations. We be out `safe-mode' right now, say Steve Terry, supervisor engineers control telescope. He say telescope be run normal control-all mode, where its computers and sensors guide where it be pointing. Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, pack their gear return Earth Sunday, make some last-minute observations Earth and talk ground-based reporters their flight. Pilot Charles Bolden say he be especially upbeat widespread public awareness telescope, which be expect eventually look back 14 billion light years nearly birth universe. It's hard go somewhere and find someone who have never hear hubble Space Telescope, say Bolden. It make little kids' eyes light up. It make little kids want learn how add and subtract and study science. The telescope's big eye have remain open, Hubble have be safe mode all motion stop because early problems link high-speed dish antennas relay satellite. The antenna be primary links relay scientific data ground. Terry say that safe mode, one tape recorders telescope reads telemetry signals all its systems and that these would be play Earth and analyze when antennas be work properly. We expect use that data investigate what happened, he said. Engineers be able send commands telescope its secondary antenna communications system be not useful scientific data, which must be transmit high rate speed. We're put scientific instruments hold mode, effect standby mode, he said. shortly 6 a.m. EDT, controllers Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md., complete series commands that take telescope out its safe mode and then begin run 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health. It will take another day $1.5 billion telescope be operate way it be suppose this point startup process, say hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're back very deliberate and slow and careful approach these problems, Olivier say Friday. This be not time do anything dumb. The telescope problems have put flight center several days behind, five astronauts who deploy it earlier this week be stick their schedule. Landing be schedule 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., flight controllers be keep close watch weather. Winds be predict be 20 mph gusts 29 mph. Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph touchdown. The shuttle carry enough supplies stay orbit three days Sunday if necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awaken crew members 1:30 a.m. EDT today play song, Cosmos. Thanks wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate today, say Commander Loren Shriver. The song be select honor hubble Space Telescope, which be now open business, say Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronauts be finish their experiments and photography today and pack trip home. They also plan hold news conference space reporters Johnson Space Center. Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden be run series tests make certain shuttle's computers and control jets be ready return Earth. The crew deploy hubble Wednesday they have stay close telescope case there be trouble open aperture door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan be prepare perform space walk today crank it open orbit 380 miles earth. But that prove unnecessary when door be open Friday morning, expose telescope's finely polish 94.5-inch eye starlight first time. Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stop work when door opened, engineers later get them back line. The gyroscopes be knock out motion and that, too, keep telescope safe mode, say Dave Drachlis, director orbital verifications goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, say Hubble's systems be set conservative limits first operations and that cause many malfunctions. There also be two communications outages total several hours. Hubble be design safe modes so it can be master its destiny case contact orbit communications system be lose extended periods, Terry said. NASA have plan release its first test image telescope Tuesday, show open star cluster constellation Carina. But Terry say that would be delay because antenna problems. Scientific data will follow month or two. The telescope, name late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers its 15-year working lifetime look back 14 billion years and possibly determine age universe. The universe be believe have be create 15 billion years ago cosmic explosion. Hubble provide basis big-bang theory creation. He discover 1920s that universe be expand and that farther galaxy be Earth, faster it be move away. After years delay and last-minute snag, hubble Space Telescope be free shuttle Discovery Wednesday and, glint sunlight, drift orbit its 15-year search new worlds. Mission specialist Steven Hawley release hubble end shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm delay get one telescope's solar wings unfurled. The first NASA's great observatories be now station 330 nautical miles Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really look great we fly away it, and we sure hope it do good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver say later. The $1.5 billion telescope be release 3:38 p.m. EDT shuttle enter its 20th orbit Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later planned. The shuttle then back away. Thank you very much ride, say Mike Harrington, director orbital verifications Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan have be shuttle's airlock, ready walk inspace free solar panel. That prove be unnecessary. Close no cigar, better Hubble that it go way it did, Sullivan said. She and McCandless have train nearly five years make such rescue mission. The first solar array unreel its mast midday Wednesday shuttle pass 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, South America's eastern coast. It start provide power telescope's batteries, which otherwise have only eight hours charge. Deployment starboard panel, however, be more troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latches be first released, then move fifth its 39-foot length, and stop again. A third attempt roll panel out all way. Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley begin long process release Hubble shortly 7 a.m. EDT when he grasp it Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoist 12{-ton telescope high shuttle. Hubble be take shuttle electrical power just it be lift out cargo bay and be operate its nickel-hydrogen batteries. At one day, seven minutes flight Discovery, Hubble be now its internal power, Carr said. The game have begun. The race be on. The clock be ticking. Worries that telescope's instruments would be starve electricity ease first solar panel be stretch out. Television cameras Discovery show first array it be pull its reel slowly steadily, sun reflect gold-colored panel and silvery telescope. Discovery be 380 statute miles earth, 70 miles higher any shuttle have ever flown. The orbit be dictate need put telescope Earth's distort atmosphere. Discovery's five astronauts be awe view. I'd pas quote day on-board astronomer something effect that big marble sure look far away today, Shriver say Hawley. Astronomers have wait seven years hubble take its place space. The telescope originally be schedule launch 1983, technical problems and Challenger explosion push it back. The mission be delay another two weeks when faulty power unit Discovery force National Aeronautics and Space Administration halt first launch attempt four minutes April 10's schedule liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blast space, transport hubble out this world and search others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door be be open Friday, expose finely polish 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Discovery be hubble case door do not open properly. If problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepare once again walk space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, say telescope would be test Thursday its ability maneuever aperture door be opened. We want be full control so we don't ever endanger hubble put aperture door close sunlight, he said. The telescope cannot focus sun because sensitivity its five instruments. If all go well, crew will land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expect release its first image telescope open star cluster constellation Carina Tuesday. Data will follow month or two. Astronomers hope look back almost begin time, study stars and galaxies so distant their light have be travel earth 14 billion years. They expect determine precisely how and when universe be formed, currently estimate 15 billion years ago. The telescope be name late american astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discover 1920s that universe be expanding. He also be responsible help form Big Bang theory creation. Ground controllers Goddard Space Flight Center finally make contact today two main antennas $1.5 billion hubble Space Telescope try more six hours lock on. Applause erupt Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md., glitch that mar Hubble's first full day space be solved. We have confirmation that we have achieve communication track and Data Relay Satellite high-gain antenna system, say NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers have say all they believe antennas be work all right and that problem be incorrectly point either satellite or TDRS, orbit communications satellite that act switchboard. In successful attempt, they nearly double width antennas' beams take more territory, sweep 6.2 degrees 10.8 degrees. The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information much slow rate and can be use emergencies, be work well. Space shuttle Discovery be 46 miles away, available remedy certain problems. The outage be not problem which space walkers would have be summoned. The five astronauts be otherwise busy make pictures storms Texas their 380-mile-high perch, and do experiments. Steve Terry, director team calibrate various aspects telescope, say first outage be cause human error and be not serious problem. It begin 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and last 45 minutes hour, he said. The second failure occur 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempt send signal telescope's two high-gain antennas TDRS. This time it be point problem, say Jim Elliott, Goddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft and we think inexperience deal it be cause. The telescope, embark 15-year search new worlds, be release shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minute snag that almost send two astronauts emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awaken crew early today loud rendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite. good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake that song, say Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There be lot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday and Hubble have good night while you be asleep. We appreciate good words everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently back Discovery away telescope and put shuttle series maneuvers, last one complete this morning, park Discovery orbit 46 miles Hubble. The telescope really look great we fly away it, and we sure hope it do good work, Shriver say Wednesday. Well, it sure be now, Loren, and thanks all great work you've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo be real proud you. Scientists have hail hubble NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft great advance astronomy Galileo raise small telescope his eyes nearly 400 years ago. Discovery and its five astronauts will follow telescope while controllers Goddard center make sure Hubble be operate properly, such respond directional commands. The next milestone be Friday, when telescope's 10-foot aperture door be be opened, expose finely polish 94.5-inch mirror starlight. then Tuesday, NASA expect release first image telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina. Data will follow month or two. If aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return telescope so two astronauts could perform spacewalk fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik say telescope would be test today its ability maneuver aperture door be opened. We want be full control so we don't ever endanger hubble put aperture door close sunlight, he said. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitive instruments. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley use shuttle's 50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope and hoist it cargo bay. One telescope's solar arrays unreel its mast expect and start provide power telescope's batteries, which otherwise have only eight hours charge. But there be trouble second panel. It wouldn't budge when latches be released, and then move fifth its 39-foot length and stop again. The panel roll all way out third attempt. By final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan be their space suits airlock, 30 minutes away take tools hand and go outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik say cause problem be unknown. The 8{-hour procedure be perform 380 miles earth, 70 miles higher any shuttle have ever flown. The orbit be dictate need put Hubble Earth's distort atmosphere. Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost begin time, study stars and galaxies so distant their light have take 14 billions years reach Earth. They hope determine how and when universe be formed, currently estimate 15 billion years ago. The telescope originally be schedule launch 1983 be delay technical problems and Challenger accident. Discovery, which blast orbit Tuesday, be schedule land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven years late, hubble Space Telescope be where it belongs, out this world and search so distant that they may have be form begin time. Less five hours it ride space shuttle Discovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope send its first test radio signal. At sign life, applause and cheers erupt Mission Control Houston. As we can tell, everything looks perfect, say astronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesday will be drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space. Discovery, trail arc white smoke brilliant blue sky, carry silver-colored telescope orbit 380 miles earth high 70 miles any previous shuttle. There Hubble will stay search yet-unseen wonders creation instruments that can look 14 billion years backward time. Our window universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exult Discovery rise its seaside launch pad. It's beautiful day have hubble Space Telescope orbit instead here Earth it's be so many years, say NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's its element and I'm delighted. The telescope be suppose be launch 1983, technical problems and Challenger accident delay its deployment. It suffer further delay two weeks ago when countdown be stop four-minutes-to-go point because faulty hydraulic unit shuttle. While it remain Earth, telescope cost $7 million month exercise and keep readiness. In its first day space, that checkout and test continue remotely control Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland. On hand watch Discovery launching be contingent scientists who have hail hubble great advance astronomy Galileo raise small telescope his eyes nearly 400 years ago. truly referred early-day astronomer when he be ask long delays get telescope its work station. somebody other day said, `who remembers day that Galileo pick his telescope look stars?' say Truly, former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matter that we do it right. The telescope be 43 feet long and 14 feet diameter, size railroad tank car. When it fly free, it will receive electrical power its six scientific instruments two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward each side. It be name late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorize that universe be expand and that farther away galaxy is, fast it be traveling. That give support theory that massive explosion Big Bang create universe 10 20 billion years ago. The Hubble be expect help provide answer two major questions: How old be universe? How big be it? The telescope have two mirrors, one 94.5 inches diameter, other 12 inches. Two instruments be cameras, two be spectrometers and one be photometer. In addition, fine point system act sixth instrument provide precise measurement distances. On Wednesday, Hawley be grapple 12{-ton telescope shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out cargo bay, point it, and long checkout drop it overboard orbit its own. In cargo bay, telescope receive electrical power shuttle. But juice be cut when instrument be lift out and it will depend internal batteries solar panels be extended receive light sun. Should solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be stand by, partially dressed space suits, ready go open cargo bay unfurl arrays manually. Discovery's launch be not its problems. With 31 seconds leave countdown, computer that run final moments liftoff refuse close fuel valve and stop launch process. The problem be overcome and shuttle lift 8:34 a.m. EDT, three minutes late. The shuttle be schedule land Sunday 9:49 a.m. EDT Edwards Air Force Base California. On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, shuttle's windshield be splatter several flecks things. He say windshield be streak debris and that it also be smear when spent booster rockets fell climb orbit. The astronauts also have problems their UHF radio circuit, and one ship's small rear thrusters be inoperative. Neither problem be consider serious. The shuttle that put Hubble Space Telescope orbit also carry instrument use 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble: eyepiece what once be world's most powerful telescope. It's great pleasure have something such historical significance and something that so directly symbolize Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan say Friday she circle Earth space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope be carry orbit Sullivan. After she bring eyepiece back Earth, it will be place display observatory. It's basically symbolic gesture astronomy future astronomy, say Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman Mount Wilson Institute. The pasadena-based group run observatory, locate San Gabriel Mountains Los Angeles. The discoveries make hubble 100-inch telescope Mount Wilson give us giant leap forward our understand universe, McAfee said. We believe hubble Space Telescope will do same thing. The Hooker Telescope be world's most powerful telescope its construction 1918 1948, when 200-inch Hale Telescope be place operation Mount Palomar Observatory northeast San Diego. Using Hooker Telescope, Hubble be first determine distance galaxy Milky Way, institute say statement. This crucial discovery provide first definite proof that other galaxies exist far confine our local galaxy, institute said. During 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and assistant use Hooker telescope take thousands photographs faint galaxies, show that most them be move away each other very quickly. This provide observational evidence concept, suggest Einstein's Theory Relativity, that universe be expanding, institute said.

Named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who did pioneering work leading to the ""Big Bang"" concept of the universe, it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime, it will provide astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.  The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.

Mr Rao urge nation ignore rumour 'inhuman and criminal blast'. A ROW have erupt Bombay stock exchange, India's large stock market, and Securities and Exchange Board India, securities watchdog, board's recent first-ever inspection stockbrokers' books. The Sebi have accuse stockbrokers flout exchange's rules, include regulations margin trading design limit risk members default excessive speculative investments. It have also accuse exchange authorities fail enforce rules and poor administration. The stock exchange deny allegations, say they be 'baseless, make out context and blow out proportion.'

THE INDIAN government fly federal paramilitary troops Bombay last night more dozen bombs explode city, kill 200 people and injure more thousand. The devices, mostly car bombs, appear be systematic attack India's commercial heart. All explode 90 minutes afternoon. Among targets be Bombay Stock Exchange, landmark Air India building, shopping complex, and two hotels airport. The identity bombers be unknown, attacks be severe setback India's attempt heal wounds create recent intercommunal violence, which have cause deep shock throughout India.

Mr Sharad Pawar, former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister Maharashtra state, say all roads Bombay have be block and army put alert. He said: 'It be aim disrupt economy and it appear conscious effort because only Bombay seem be target.' Mr Shankarrao Chavan, federal home (interior) minister, tell parliament New Delhi: 'We suspect international conspiracy.' The indian High Commission London say attacks be 'part externally support terrorism which have target India some time'. However, Indian officials stop short directly accuse Pakistan, country's arch-enemy. The bomb attacks be spread throughout city and be clearly aim city's better-off business people - contrast riots which victims be mainly poor.

They sense there be enormous difference riots which scar city December and again January. Those be cause traditional mix crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stir destruction mosque Ayodhya. The weapons use be mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles. Friday's outrage, contrast, bears deadly stamp high-technology terrorism, complete Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money. The only comparable previous incident be assassination 1991 Mr Rajiv Gandhi, former prime minister, Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists. But that be single bomb aim one man - explosions Bombay be design terrorise nation's commercial capital. Bombay account 35 cent India's exports. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, describe blasts attack India's economy. The immediate assumption high level and streets Bombay be that those responsible must have be foreigners or have foreign help. But these suggestions be see Bombay deliberate attempt deflect attention people who popular mind be real suspects - Moslem extremists who might have take revenge riots which hit India Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which leave 2,000 dead, include 700 Bombay. If Moslems be find have stag attacks, indian authorities will certainly suspect that operation be support Moslem country, notably Pakistan. The implications would be vast. Breaking diplomatic relations would be minimum step Delhi could take dangerous road. Mr Rao choose his words carefully his visit Bombay: 'There be definite possibility that our search may not stop country. I do not want name anybody because it will have ramifications and country.' There be no evidence link attacks Moslem extremists, let alone Pakistan. even if Moslem groups be find be responsible bombings, they could have be supply other Moslem countries. India would still face diplomatic crisis hardly same scale. For moment, such concerns seem remote streets Bombay, where atmosphere yesterday be calm. Workmen be clear away rubble blast sites, include blacken stock exchange building. Bombayites seem determine put outrage them. At Gymkhana Club and dozens other sports grounds, hundreds men and boys be play cricket they do every sunday. Others be walk seafront arch Gateway India. The stock exchange authorities plan re-start trading soon they can -probably today - use old trading floor exchange vacate only last year. Businessmen estimate main loss city would be loss life and injuries and damage cause blast buildings. They not expect same widespread disruption production occur riots. Some credit limited disruption should go government and police promptly call paramilitary and regular troops help patrol sensitive districts. But much more should go people Bombay, who, so far least, have refuse be goad violent protest bombers.

2,d120i,"THE revelation that John Major be capable candid, blunt and salty language when talk off-the- record friendly journalists have surprise some people. It have be suggest that record prime minister's conversation Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, which Major use variety four-, six- and eight-letter words communicate his lack fondness certain colleagues, may do him good. With luck, it be reckoned, Major's image leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction. What piffle. Major be gonner, especially this week's revolt wooden-tops Christchurch by-election, where Conservative majority 23,015 last year's general election be convert 16,427 majority Liberal Democrats. Fifteen months too late, voters Christchurch round Tories malignant and squeaky fury. In reality, all politicians, not just Major, be far more candid and salty when chat private when speak public. In public, they have be careful what they say, so their utterances achieve horrible mattness. But private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really be spectacle. To show you what I mean, I speak yesterday John Major and John Smith. Smith, Scot, be leader Labour Party, though not many people know that. In aftermath Christchurch, where Labour lose its deposit, I want provoke two Johns spot real soul-searching. To guarantee them privacy, I use signal-scrambler. No one could have eavesdropped. Their responses be true form. But I have leave out swear-words because new Financial Times Style Guide state that 'the gratuitous use expletives or obscenities be discourage . . . four-letter expletives will be confine infrequent use review (Arts) pages.' I can live that, though why artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation be puzzle. First, I tackle Major. I said: 'Did you read, john, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, just one article, FT this week? They be describe Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements. They not pull their punches. I bet you go chalk-white. 'So why not walk plank, John? You be most unpopular prime minister start fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly or not, you be draw blame all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone cock-ups.' 'Are you sure?' prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . how it come about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load . . . let me put it you - economy, course . . . I mean, wimpy guy me. But I'm not give that, . . .' On and it went. then I ring John Smith. I tell him I have be impress his interview Andrew Marr The Independent Thursday, which he sharpen his promise introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever get elected), include referendum proportional representation. I said: 'You be start raise your game, John. Many people will have agree your assertion that democracy Britain be decaying, and that Tories must be roast their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation power and elimination opposition'. But some your critics still accuse you, John, laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say that?' 'Away, ye thowless jad,' shout Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense life, behint kist lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig be Rab M'Graen, clever, sturdy fellow, then he be sae fley'd his showther gae keek, an' tumbl'd wi' wintle. Likewise political and constitutional reform, Michael, L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, lang's I dow]' After that, I think telephone Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader Liberal Democrats, solicit his views Christchurch. But I couldn't raise energy. last year biography Mrs Norma Major - or, if we be be old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claim that Majors' favourite film be be There. I entirely concur their choice. In case you not see that marvellous film, this, essence, be plot: man no one know anything about, gardener call Chauncey, rise trace become, end film, serious candidate US presidency. Chauncey, play Peter Sellers, utter only mundane sentiments halt monotone this convinces Republican party's power brokers that he be sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seem hear what they want believe. He have deadly innocence. No wonder Majors like this film. John Major must, some level, have appreciate similarity his own, strangely intangible, rise and that Chauncey's. If he not see similarity, that be still more revealing. do not protest that urban John Major could not identify gardener. In interview Farmers Weekly, few days ago, Major disclose unknown fact: his father be once farmer. Farmers Weekly, you see, have ask Major how he have 'such obvious empathy agriculture'. (well, it be obvious Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And Major replied: 'It's simple. My father be farmer. He live small farm somewhere Shropshire.' Francis Wheen The Guardian, keen student Major's mysterious past, immediately ring 10 Downing Street, which claim that Major's father farm Bromsgrove 1910. As Wheen point out, Major be unresponsive 33 years old that time, and - minor point this - Bromsgrove be not Shropshire. This, course, do not mean that Major make everything up. Family folklore be peculiar thing. yet when I hear this, my mind immediately go back incident few months ago, when Major visit Pittsburgh, centre US steel industry, part his american tour. I recall that he make great hit recount that his father have be steelworker city. A farmer Farmers Weekly, Pittsburgh steelworker american audience . . . pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore extension John Major himself, can be all things all people. If John Major be different sort politician, this would be point barely worth making. But it do seem all piece Major's approach wider political issues. On one hand he will appeal pro-Europeans his party claim want Britain be heart Europe. On other he be free insult references european Commission, whenever it be necessary appeal audience Euro-sceptics. There be those who will argue that this merely mean that Major be typical democratic politician, that one who want become prime minister democracy must recognise many constituencies interest, not just one. But that have not be true Major's most recent conservative predecessors. Margaret Thatcher be notoriously dogmatic, public, and so too be Edward Heath, though he always pretend be 'consensus politician'. No, Major's technique be very much his invention, very much reflection his particular character, itself product his unsettled family background. His father, Tom Major-Ball, be itinerant figure, move place place, try his hand any number occupations, include circus. No wonder young John Major learn skill fit prevail circumstances, no matter how fluctuating. The only problem be old one: you cannot fool all people all time. Except movies. Dominic Lawson be editor The Spectator ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprise everyone himself win general election. His honeymoon, very personal victory, be short-lived and now he begin second year his hard-won term deeply unpopular leader who have everything still prove. The 12 months have be hijack internal party differences Europe, debacle surround UK withdrawal exchange rates mechanism european Monetary System, and continuing, deep recession which have disappoint and alienate many traditional Tory supporters business. Mr Major's anniversary inevitably lead yesterday outbreak political point-scoring government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader Commons, conceded: 'No one pretend that last year have be easy,' he also claim that much have be achieved. The government's efforts secure framework long-term prosperity be begin pay off. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, be join 10 frontbench colleagues launch counter-attack, involve detailed and documented indictment Mr Major's failures. He attack Tories build 'a bonfire pre-election commitments'. Tory allegiances business world have also be put immense pressure, though criticism policy drift and inaction may soften recession ends. yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president Confederation British Industry, remain cautious volunteered: 'If I be bet man I would say we have embryo recovery.' Mr Major can take little comfort conclusion, widespread industrialists, that his great achievement year have be Britain's withdrawal ERM - something which he resist and which, end, he have no control. most industrialists, however, find it hard criticise Mr Major individual, many draw flatter parallel his personal qualities and those his predecessor. He still attract gratitude election victory, which be see - subsequent problems economy - best result business. But, previous No 10 occupant, he be see weak leader, little vision and bereft clearly articulate political conviction. There be general perception that, important though Britain's future place Europe is, prime minister have be excessively preoccupy community affairs and associate internal party ructions, detriment domestic economy. many industrialists be pleased that Mr Major be now attempt reshape economic strategy favour manufacturing base.

Out be eminences gris victorian letters - novels Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advise Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make grade. This week shortlist hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announce six judges, include biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. They have avoid dull and worthy classics and choose six books which stir fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In Year Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide. The winner will be reveal October 15 (four days 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) Cheltenham Festival Literature. Like today's Booker Prize, it be publish gimmick; Everyman, which be back spoof award, be significant publisher classic victorian novels. But retrospective Booker be also fascinating exercise historical reconstruction. It raise questions how relationship literature and society have change 100 years. First, similarities. A good yarn be good yarn. Of 1894 books, Trilby be tale tone-deaf model who sing angel when mesmerise sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croak crow when he die one her concerts. The Prisoner Zenda tell Englishman impersonate King Ruritania and rescue him demons. On 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef be Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge Angels re-enacts wolf-child legend. All books lists be grip stories. The lists share key themes. Both, instance, have books colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which be set First World War German East Africa. Both provoke similar ways. The controversial books 1894 be Trilby, its louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, which 17-year-old girl be seduced, impregnated and offer services professional baby killer fiver. It be now see Moore's best work, 1894 it have problems find publisher and powerful circulate libraries refuse take it. A century on, relationship fiction and sexual morality remain vexed. last week, Times critic complain inclusion Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel homosexual love, The Folding Star, Booker list, because it offend judaeo-christian ethics. But if Hollinghurst win Booker, his novel will not become succes de scandale Esther Waters and Trilby, which become bestselling novel 19th century. For great difference then and now be that 1894 Booker Prize be not need sell fiction. Today, we accept gap literary writing, such Hollinghurst's, and popular bestsellers writers Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland. This be gap Booker tries bridge give high-level publicity work which would not normally reach mass audience. The trick work - last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sell 360,000 hardback copies. Before short-list be announce it sell 10,600. The Victorians, contrast, be lovers contemporary fiction. Novels account 20 cent publish books, and no distinction be make high and low art. In mid 19th century, Dickens make Pounds 12,000 Little Dorrit, equivalent nearly Pounds 400,000 today. Between 1861 and 1894, when population UK be half that today and literate population small still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sell 400,000 copies. All 1894 Booker writers be popular names; they be also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread pleasure 100 years later. Why be fiction so much closer public heart 1894? Social, cultural and psychological reasons play part. Socially, 1890s read public be vastly more homogenous group today: small number middle class authors write middle class audience time when be literate be belong elite. The idea two-tier, and down-market, fiction be irrelevant. Culturally, these writers and readers be certain their place mainstream, and novel be their political and intellectual forum. Today we no longer share victorian confidence novel key genre our age. Modernism and overturn traditional form Joyce and Woolf weaken 20th-century belief novel and encourage divergence highbrow and lowbrow. The dominance film and television have make novels more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract most creative talents. George du Maurier originally offer outline Trilby Henry James, who he think would write good novel. Today du Maurier would have sell it Hollywood or BBC. The fantasy element fiction, which we identify characters if we know them, be answer 19th century novel; 20th century we have tv soaps. Just tabloid newspapers feature characters EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop be run serial there be widespread press speculation whether Little Nell would die, and readers write beg her be saved. Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality - what characterise today's soaps be clear features novel 1894. Both In Year Jubilee and Esther Waters, example, centre burn 1890s debate marriage, feminism and 'New Woman', be also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed. The 1894 books be compel because they prefigure our times and be set back them. Trilby be tale hypnotism and unconscious decade away Freud; The Ebb Tide pave way Conrad's Heart Darkness and first question colonial oppression. It be unlikely that 1994 Booker choices will speak eloquently new trends today. Whereas 1894 titles have contemporary settings, many 1994 books be historical (such Paradise) or be drive nostalgia (such Beside Ocean Time). Which book will win October 15? Stevenson will get sympathy vote because he die 1894 Samoa, set The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book will get retrospective vote, because it be best-known today and have fashionable mythic overtones lose paradise Mowgli's jungle; its position list may also rescue it schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it serious novel young man's self-discovery. My vote go Trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - its anti-semitic portrait Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it be story demonic possession and haunts imagination fairy tale long better-written works have fade memory. Like Rebecca, popular novel du Maurier's granddaughter, it be natural equivalent what current Booker Prize seek create: combination classic and bestseller. The shortlist six pound 20,000 Booker Prize fiction, announce yesterday, immediately prompted question 'Who?' many publishing industry. accord one insider, some list 'are b-team writers best'. The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published Chatto and Windus), melancholy study homosexual obsession which be tip likely candidate initial 'long list' 15, The Reef (Granta) young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (secker and Warburg) gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which be almost universally well-reviewed. As other three - Knowledge Angels (Green Bay) philosophical fable children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (hamish Hamilton) Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside Ocean Time (John Murray) 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make grade'. The shortlist Booker, UK's most hype literary prize and one most lucrative, be all more surprising bumper year new fiction fulfil criteria - english language and non-american - consideration award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seem astonish omission, do new novels Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace. But if shortlist final six candidates prize may be disappointing, traditional controversy surround award be rife ever. One unsurprising omission final selection be When The World Was Steady, first novel Claire Messud, which be 'long list' it be point out that author be wife James Wood, chief literary reviewer The Guardian newspaper and Booker judge. Professor John Bayley, chairman Booker panel and husband former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, express surprise Mr Wood's failure reveal his relationship Ms Messud. But it be final list, rather controversy, that discredit award accord some critics. 'This list,' say one man letters, 'must have deal final death blow Booker.' The winner, select original 130, will be announce October 11. The Booker Prize be Britain's literary event year, guarantee boost sales choose novel award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner London's ancient Guildhall. The prize author be check 20,000 pounds (nearly $38,000), sponsored Booker, international food and agriculture business. british publishers be very secretive their sales we know that when Thomas Keneally win it 1982 `Schindler's Ark,' his publishers, who have print 15,000 copies, sell 75,000 next 23 weeks, say Christine Shaw Book Trust.

But, tragic sink Estonia loss more 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go toll human life can be high. As ferries increase size, so numbers board risk mechanical failure or crew error go up. The move roll-on roll-off ferries vehicle decks which run entire length vessel have increase risk that, once sea penetrates hold bow doors or gash ship's side, it can lead vessel capsizing. The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its members, ship-owning nations, have devote much think two decades ship safety. But sink Estonia should lead new review ferry safety. Particularly worrying be eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrate bow doors manner reminiscent sinking Herald Free Enterprise 1987. Unlike Herald, Estonia appear have have its doors closed, ro-ros be undoubtedly very vulnerable water penetration. Any review ferry safety should focus three main issues. First subject ferry design should be reconsidered. Additional stability could be provide addition sponsons, stabilising bulges which project ship's side just water line. Greater resistance influx water could be obtain instal moveable barriers or bulkheads break large car decks. These proposals be look british government wake sinking Herald Free Enterprise. It calculate that it would cost Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m improve standards 57 vessels UK ferry fleet, further Pounds 22m extra annual run costs. high costs would inevitably lead high fares - unwelcome ferry operators when, short cross-Channel routes, they face competition Channel tunnel. But difficulty push fare rises would be nothing damage ferry companies another disaster. Second, IMO and national governments must look closely how improve enforcement exist regulations. The IMO have be try move enforcement its agenda, it depend good will and professionalism governments and shipowners. Third, IMO should be give support national governments its campaign, launch yesterday, improve crew training. much regulation recent years have concentrate improve ship and its equipment. Above all, if new regulation do turn out be necessary, it must be introduce speedily. As things stand, it can take years changes be ratify enough governments give them force. The European Union, which Sweden and Finland be get ready join, could take lead speed process. Ship safety be not, course, just issue ferry sector. Five (small) ferries be lose last year, accord Lloyd's Register. But this figure pal insignificance compare 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also go down. When cargo vessel third-world crew go distant ocean, very little attention be paid. If loss relatively modern passenger vessel european waters can make shipping safety high priority governments and public, this will be some small compensation loss life Estonia.

The newspaper report that Combest later give different story FBI, say that Tower and group friends not Tower alone have frequently consume bottle scotch. After meet staff and advisers, Combest, who work then-sen. Tower 1970s, issue two-sentence statement support his fellow Texan. As member Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence senator and his abilities lead this country's arm forces. In my judgment, John Tower will be superb secretary defense, statement said. Combest spokesman Rich Adams refuse comment further, and say Combest be not available speak reporters. The Washington Post report that Combest describe Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner Virginia, ranking Republican committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts 1970s.

You would obviously expect Mr. Tower say no, and he obliges: volubly and passionately. If that be all there be ""consequences,"" we could scan dust jacket and invest our savings local real estate. ""Consequences"" read bit political Stephen King story small senator swell Beltway monster. Politics never have be squeamish, Tower controversy leave much more disagreeable taste senator's caperings (which mostly take place '70s anyway). Were write less stiff and narrative technique less choppy, ""consequences"" might have be classic case study late 20th-century politics out control. Given Mr. Tower's qualifications job -- intelligence, patriotism and chairmanship Armed Services Committee -- nomination should have sail fly colors. instead it sink Bismarck. Clearly and apparently his surprise, Mr. Tower have make many enemies his arrival Washington 1961, rub supporters wrong way. The senator Lone Star State could be lordly, his english-cut suits. Once, meeting editors my newspaper which have back him strongly, he think nothing tilt back his chair, cross his tiny, well-shod feet atop conference table. When Tower hearings opened, all manner accusations come public notice. The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claim have see senator consort A Lady not His wife.

At his hotel, Mr. Tower be accord that doubtful tribute instant-celebrity status, media stakeout. The nominee issue fervent denials: He drink only wine, have long sworn scotch; he'd never chase secretaries; his services defense-industry clients have be proper and modest. none charges, least Mr. Tower's showing, prove have least substance. No use. Dirt be dirty purity be pure, one John O'Hara's characters observes. Sen. Sam Nunn, Mr. Tower's successor Armed Services Committee chairman, seem initially smile nomination; then rumor mill start churn and he change fronts. While endeavor look statesmanlike, Sen. Nunn lean moderate Democrats who would otherwise have support Tower. Sen. Nunn make campaign personal, say Mr. Tower -- vote me or vote him. most Democrats, end, go Sen. Nunn. What be all this about? Morality? Mr. Tower suggest instead that Sen. Nunn, presidential hopeful, discover and seize opportunity show who be really no. 1 national defense. Sen. Nunn have every reason know that moral and ethical charges level Mr. Tower, and investigate exhaustively FBI, be flimsy. Yet he wave them anyway. When media retail lurid and unsubstantiated stories, Sen. Nunn purse his lips Georgia Sunday-school superintendent and suggest that drunken Mr. Tower might accidentally press nuclear button. ""Sam Nunn,"" Mr. Tower insists, ""used FBI inquiries discredit me and strike president United States. The essential chain good judgment and goodwill break my confirmation process."" Sen. Nunn have company Mr. Tower's dishonor roll. There be Sen. Ernest Hollings (""a study arrogance and pomposity""), Sen. James Exon (""one most excessive regular boozers Senate"") and NBC's Andrea Mitchell (""the most viciously partisan reporter I've ever seen""), Washington press corps. Sen.

Worse yet, lynch mob remain large. --- Mr. Murchison be senior columnist Dallas Morning News. The democratic-controlled Senate today reject nomination former Texas Sen.

Names most frequently mention White House speculation replacement Tower if his nomination fail be Sen. Warner, former secretary Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. Scowcroft reply No when ask this morning if he be line Pentagon job. It must be clear all that people chief staff and national security adviser, any number congressmen and senators and any number other experts have candidates tip their tongue, Fitzwater said.

It show 41 Republicans and three Democrats declare Tower or lean his way. Nevertheless, White House say it want see nomination go all way vote. Tower, meanwhile, report work Pentagon where he and his three daughters have coffee together. He then continue review various administration proposals. I hope and believe we can work together important matters, Mitchell said. The tension this issue will have no long-lasting effect relationship.

And laymen, something that odd could make sense country where illness can mean anything flu precipitous fall power.;the most volatile fuel conspiracy theory come directly Gorbachev himself, his Thursday news conference which he describe his three days house arrest Crimea.;Among questions: If Gorbachev's 32 arm guards remain loyal him throughout, why be there no conflict opposition delegation that notify president coup? Why didn't coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or least separate them him?;if Gorbachev's contact world be limited intercepting western radio outlets ancient shortwave radio, how be he able describe news conference give collaborators, his view their trembling hands?;it be highly unlikely that hard-liners have be set or order Gorbachev launch hopeless coup attempt order improve his political standing. such scenario would require unprecedented degree selfless commitment Gorbachev their part.;a more plausible scenario be that Gorbachev be initially full member conspiracy, which, his participation, could have cling fig leaf constitutionality and would have thwart new Union Treaty, have be sign last Tuesday, which provide transfer key levers power federal presidency leaders republics.;it be possible that, unwilling take huge risk and openly side hard-liners start coup, Gorbachev have decide become ill and wait out initial phase virtually self-imposed confinement his summer residence.;gorbachev reveal, however, that two important officials have visit him Crimea outset coup. One be head KGB department responsible security Soviet leaders; other be V. Boldin, Gorbachev's close aide, president's admission man absolute loyalty him. One can't help wonder whether these two visitors come deliver ultimatum Gorbachev and put him arrest event his non-compliance, or deliver important documents fellow junta members outset their joint enterprise.;conspiracy theorists grope motives -- Gorbachev want ferret out disloyal elements his government, make himself hero and delay schedule sign treaty that would have lessen his powers.

Gorbachev Friday propose tough legislation punish Soviets who seek kindle ethnic unrest, say nationalist passions benefit opponents his reforms. The soviet leader tell meet Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations be worsen some regions country, due part active resistance put perestroika corrupt groups. Perestroika, or restructuring, be Gorbachev's program widespread economic and social change. State-run media also indicate Friday that crackdown have begin people Armenia who continue agitate annexation mostly armenian enclave neighbor republic Azerbaijan. The six-month conflict two republics control Nagorno-Karabakh district have lead mass rallies, strikes and ethnic violence February. The Supreme Soviet Presidium, government's top executive body, intervene July 18. It reject any change Nagorno-Karabakh's status call measures develop region's economy and culture. The conflict Nagorno-Karabakh be one most rancorous domestic disputes face Gorbachev he become Communist Party chief March 1985. He indicate Friday he want defuse tensions ethnic groups, also punish those who transform tensions political crisis. Gorbachev speak plenary meeting Central Committee, party's policy-making body. A summary his remarks be distribute official Tass news agency. Gorbachev outline reasons current aggravation tensions ethnic groups some regions soviet Union, Tass said. Among causes, Gorbachev list lack concern many years specific requirements peoples and ethnic groups, inadequate control mass activities executive personnel, and active resistance put perestroika corrupt groups. Tass say that Gorbachev note that nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces, he suggest increase accountability Soviet laws kindle ethnic strife. Tass not give details Gorbachev's suggestion. At July 18 Presidium meeting, soviet leader accuse corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms hide nagorno-karabakh annexation drive. Gorbachev say grounds tough legislation come directly Article 36 1977 Soviet Constitution, which say law can punish any advocacy racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt. Tass say Gorbachev make other proposals how resolve ethnic tensions, include increase power each country's 15 republics, law equal use more 100 languages speak Soviet Union and some economic autonomy country's republics and regions. In particular, Baltic republics Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, forcibly incorporate Soviet Union 1940, have demand more say their economic and government affairs. The labor newspaper Trud say 44 people Yerevan, Armenia's capital, will face criminal charges incident which activists seek annexation Nagorno-Karabakh attach slogans their cars and drive city. The paper not give date or size mobile demonstration, say 155 drivers have have their licenses revoke and 310 be fined. In its July 18th decision, Presidium also order local law enforcement agencies ensure order be restore Caucasus Mountain region. Tass report Friday that situation be stabilize Armenia, say that urge instigators, some strikes and protests be continuing. The international community be start look conflict former Yugoslavia, and be become increasingly aware true magnitude and seriousness ethnic and political conflicts former soviet Union. The problem be indeed press one. The disputes Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere former Soviet Union be cause great suffer those involved. They be source legitimate concern Russians, who be worried clashes close their borders. They be concern too safety ethnic Russians live those countries where there be conflicts, and economic and social consequences refugees flee Russia (whose potential number be estimate more 2m). They believe that problems some former soviet republics be either ignore or misunderstood. The Russians fear that if they do nothing, conflicts will worsen and probably spread. They argue that they have legitimate concern try resolve conflicts that threaten their security. They ask why, when international community be engage peacemaking and peacekeeping many world's trouble spots, similar efforts should not be undertake hot spots them. Equally, these disputes be legitimate concern Britain, its western partners and whole international community, humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoke regional instability. If uncontrolled, they pose variety threats european security, include increase traffic drugs and arms well international terrorism. Crises Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations west: unless they be carefully handled, they risk prejudice emerge relationship us. The west be sometimes suspicious Moscow's attitude. There be no differences need resolve these conflicts: there be differences how go it. The british government will not underwrite russian involvement unless it be sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn occupy forces. Nor be countries that secure their independence when Soviet Union be dissolve keen that west should concede Moscow same role it play Soviet empire. They fear that this would compromise their sovereignty. When they be willing russian troops play peacekeeping role, they want there be some form international monitoring. This have mean that, though west lacks resources engage directly those trouble spots, it have be wary appear endorse russian involvement instead, case it have imperial tendencies. If we be fashion joint approach Russia and its western partners problem peacekeeping former soviet Union, we must address all these concerns. clearly Russia have important role play this area. If Russians want international recognition and more active support international community, west turn needs guarantees that Russia will not regard recognition its involvement give it carte blanche former soviet Union. Peace-keeping former Soviet Union, indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply internationally recognise principles. It need be look case case basis. Respect sovereignty newly independent countries must remain paramount. We agree that principles underlie Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operations would need include: strict respect sovereignty countries involved; invitation government concern and consent parties conflict; commitment parallel political peace process; clear mandate set out role peacekeeping forces (which should whenever possible be multinational character); and exit strategy peacekeeping forces deployed. These principles should help stimulate dialogue and political settlement parties conflict, focus attention and, where possible, resources settlement conflicts former soviet Union. All this will help enhance russian peacekeeping practices. Although Conference Security and Co-operation Europe and UN lack resources put large numbers peacekeepers grind themselves, they may be able suggest measures enhance transparency and monitor peace process. Extending co-operation North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and also co-operation Russia and Nato, might help improve train russian peacekeepers. This be area we shall need explore further. We also need put much more emphasis preventive diplomacy. One ways which we can help prevent conflicts be strengthen democratic institutions newly independent countries former soviet Union. The CSCE and other international institutions can play important role here, draw newly independent countries more active dialogue ways promote democratic values and principles. We discuss ways strengthen CSCE's role, include role High Commissioner National Minorities, recent Rome ministerial meeting. We must try find ways manage and resolve tensions they erupt conflict. It will not be easy, we must try. Potentially explosive cocktails ethnic and political animosities could spread fire intolerance all too easily other countries and regions. We need deal it together spirit partnership. And we need deal it urgently. Our security be indivisible and we must ensure it vigorous and imaginative efforts aim promote peace all well rights all.

As more severe conflict Nagorno-Karabakh, underlying tensions be grow and neither side believe it be losing. In other respects, however, conflicts be quite different and illustrate complexity conflict which former Soviet Union be now faced. The Trans Dnestr conflict stem directly breakup Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh have be source tension Azeris and Armenians centuries. Moldova (formerly Moldavia) be finally take full soviet control 1944. The soviet leadership seek stifle any attempts preserve its former links Romania - call Moldovan separate language Romanian, and construct separate history Moldovan people. Industry be largely situated leave bank Dnestr, sliver republic next Ukraine, and largely staffed Russians and Ukrainians. Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 cent population, Moldovans account 64 cent. The little republic (4.5m people) be slow respond stirrings reform. When it did, 1989, language movement quickly put hardline Communist Party defensive and it lose power 1990 present nationalist government, head President Mircea Snegur, former secretary Moldovan Party's central committee. From begin nationalist movement, it be clear that russian and, lesser extent, ukrainian minorities would be hostile, react laws establish Moldovan official language and call renew union Romania strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaim Trans Dnestr independent russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov. During August coup last year, Moldovan government stoutly reject it and Trans Dnestr authorities welcome it, side soviet army its brief efforts impose military rule. Thereafter, two sides have gather military forces. The Trans Dnestr side have be augment Cossacks nearby areas return their traditional role defenders Russia's borders. The daily Izvestia report yesterday that Cossacks appear have appoint themselves mercenaries Russians (they be pay Rbs2,000 Rbs5,000 week Trans Dnestr authorities).

No new outbreaks be report region border city Osh western Kirghizia, where clashes arise land dispute begin June 2 ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, Sunni Moslems. The argument involve allocation land densly populated region where housing be scarce. It be late series bloody civil conflicts trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government. Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief Interior Ministry's Political Department, say that two years civil strife mainly ethnic clashes soviet Union, 24,000 people have be arrested. He say Moscow Tuesday that ministry troops have be use 13 regions Soviet Union because such outbreaks, Tass said.

The general be quote say these conflicts be accompany riots and pogroms, arson and massacre innocent people, (and) complete or partial destabilization situation. Besides unrest this month Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence also have be report recent years Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan. The government have decide give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who be expel their homelands Josef Stalin their autonomous regions it will take years, Tass report Wednesday. The ice have be broken. A start have be made. We're work create such autonomy, say Rafik Nishanov, chairman chamber Soviet legislature, remarks carry official news agency. However, he said, nuts and bolt how create regions still have be work out. For example, 10-year program resettlement. People can't just be expel area move in. The Tatars Crimea and ethnic Germans who live Volga River be forcibly resettle World War II, when Josef Stalin kick peoples out their homelands grounds they could not be trust occupy strategic areas. The Tatars and Germans, others, long have be agitate return Siberia and Central Asia their traditional lands, and last month Supreme Soviet legislature declare that all peoples exile Stalin should be consider politically rehabilitated. But other people now occupy lands and houses that belong exiles, and re-establishing their dominion their home regions will not be so simple. The Supreme Soviet take basic decision that two autonmous regions should be create Nov. 28 keep it quiet, apparently fear explosive reactions populations now live regions. It be also potentially dangerous precedent: The Soviet Union be patchwork well 100 ethnic groups, and many them have outstanding territorial claims. Trouble already have be report ethnic Germans and Russians several cities Volga. Residents Saratov and Volgograd regions have protest prospect see many nation's estimate 2 million Germans descend them. Ethnographers estimate there be some 500,000 crimean Tatars Soviet Union, and another 1 million Turkey. Their protests Kremlin 1987 demand be allow return their homeland be first tests President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promise great democracy. Several thousand Tatars have be filter back Crimea each year lack wholesale permission return. A wave some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrate West Germany this year, many would probably stay if they could be assure their republic, say Irina Ostroukh, researcher Soviet Institute Ethnography who studies ethnic Germans. The Nov. 28 plan approve Supreme Soviet recommended german region areas where resistance german resettlement be strong order avoid ethnic conflicts. The explosive conflict Armenians and Azerbaijanis Nagorno-Karabakh region have lead 200 deaths and hundreds thousands refugees last two years. Both sides claim control mountainous enclave. The Supreme Soviet charge government create commmission determine how create regions Germans and Crimean Tatars.

However, Alan Hecht, director National Climate Program Washington, D.C., say uncertainty mean policymakers should begin deal possible effects, especially undertaking policies that make sense their right. Mankind must reduce reliance fossil fuels, he said, become more energy efficient, replant forests and investigate alternative energy supplies. Scientists have warn recent years that Earth's atmosphere be gain carbon dioxide and other gases, which trap heat and cause overall temperature rise.

The Iranian president appealed for international aid and the response was overwhelming, including assistance from the United States, the first such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. On the negative side, Iranian news media were slow to report on the disaster and the Iranian and U.S. government were blamed by their respective critics for the excessive casualties.","An earthquake hit Gilan and Zanjan provinces in northwestern Iran onJune 21, 1990 killing at least 50,000 people, injuring 200,000 andleaving 400,000 homeless.

In Tampa 1991, the black community shared in the profits.San Francisco has four Vince Lombardi Trophies.","Super Bowl XXIV gave the 49ers their fourth Vince Lombardi Trophy. Sixty-three percent of TV viewers watched the lopsided game which also featured the conclusion of the ""Bud Bowl II,"" a $7 million Anheuser Bush ad campaign. Though the game can spotlight a community's problems, it also has tremendous economic impact. Communities such as Los Angeles--Orange County, therefore, offer incentives, such as rent-free stadium use, to lure the game to their city. Even with tougher business entertainment tax laws, companies are well represented at the event.Traditionally, the winning Super Bowl team is invited to the White House.","The winning Super Bowl team gets the Vince Lombardi Trophy and is usually invited to the White House. But The Super Bowl is more than a game, it is big business. Though tax laws governing business entertainment were tightened in 1987, corporate ticket purchases are still high. Approximately 100,000 people visit the host city for a week of pre-game festivities, generating approximately $200 million in revenues for the community. Bidding for the game is increasingly competitive. In 1990, for example, the Los Angeles Sports Council, hoping to lure the game to Pasadena, offered the Rose Bowl rent-free for Super Bowl XXVII. Television, of course, is part of the Super Bowl equation. Both Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser Bush spent over $7million on ads that aired before and during Super Bowl XXIV. That game, unlike the previous Super Bowl that ended in a dramatic 20-16 San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, was a sleeper. San Francisco routed Denver 55-10 in the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.Frequently, the Super Bowl will highlight a community's problems. For example, a parade in conjunction with the 1991 Super Bowl in Tampa was cancelled after its sponsor, an all-white, all-male club, refused to integrate.",,,,

The result portrait dissipate ogre who can't spell be duly presented hardback form public, which turn be so shocked and disgust that it force itself buy biography millions. A can't-miss formula, surely. Albert Goldman's previous victim genre be Elvis Presley. now Mr. Presley was, if you'll forgive expression, fat target writer Mr. Goldman's methods. His title notwithstanding, ""king Rock 'n' Roll"" be truth more creature old show biz, star whose wholesome image, carefully create P.R. wizards, be ripe debunking. But choose Mr. Lennon his next target, Mr. Goldman appear be try debunk undebunkable. For apart his puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic thousands interview he give be his squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy employees, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on. By his accounting, then, Mr. Lennon be not dethrone Ward Cleaver all-american dad. His public love him spite it all -- or perhaps because it all. Mr. Lennon grow celebrity time when such transgressions intemperance and adultery (quaint terms!) be lose their social sting. His candor -- if that's what it was, and not simple logorrhea -- redeem everything. And so it be grounds insufficient candor that resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot debunk, attack his subject. The leitmotif Mr. Lennon's confessions be that his bad days be him, and that Yoko Ono he have last learned prize virtues quietude and domesticity. now Mr. Goldman be here announce: He didn't tell you half it. Hence this 718-page stew unrelieved sordidness, percolate ""scoops"" that have now be widely publicize People magazine, ""west 57th"" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon have thing young boys; that his marriage Ms. Ono be pock same faithlessness and rancor that characterize his first marriage; that he have sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit. The squalid revelations dribble out chemical leak, slim every page. Remarkably, then, sleazemonger's art have triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon be bad John Lennon's John Lennon. A great deal this muck manage splash Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portray cynical manipulator whose major talent lay exploit Mr. Lennon further her craving fame and wealth. Mr. Goldman, alas, allow pas unremarked obvious irony that this be rather fine thumbnail sketch himself well. The keepers Lennon flame have course be quick point this out. Ms. Ono and her son have take path prefer offend celebrities, they have hit talk shows display their wounds. And Rolling Stone magazine, long house organ Lennon publicity machine, recently publish extensive rebuttal book, which be undercut tone priggish indignation border comic. criticize ""the Lives John Lennon"" insufficient respect fall Beatle's legacy be rather point -- condemn Charles Manson his bad table manners. The book may indeed be inaccurate, critics have charged. But one can only hope that quibble its veracity do not obscure countless other reasons hate Mr. Goldman's book. There is, starters, sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive grad-school smoking lounge -- Mr. Goldman be sort writer who refer pop songs ""pieces,"" though they be concerti. There be his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- drugs, sex, music -- that give him license second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. And there be awkward organization, which minor events assume large proportions simple reason that they reflect badly Mr. Lennon, while major events be skip lightly because -- there go advance! -- they might reveal Mr. Lennon flatter light. All which indicate why ""the live John Lennon"" be such wretched book: not because it make good man look bad, because it show no other purpose make man -- whether good man or bad one, we laymen will probably never know -- look bad.

Organizerslike refer Spoleto world's most comprehensive artsfestival.hurricane Hugo will go record books costliest storm insurers have face so far, it won't cause property-casualty premium rates rise immediately, analysts and company officials say. The property claims service division American Insurance Service Group, trade association, be expect announce its estimate total insured losses tomorrow. ""Hugo will be big hurricane loss record,"" say one official, far surpass $752.5 million insurers pay out Frederick rip several Gulf Coast state 1979. The impact premium rates could be minimal now, analysts expect, because big losses will be personal insurance area -- homes and autos. Most companies typically set aside funds premiums they collect every year cover claims they might have pay future. In last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have be relatively mild, so insurers haven't have dip these funds. And Hugo also storm Caribbean, foreign insurers be risk some damage those islands. Yet, some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make dent industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely slash premium rates further come months. Rates have be fall late 1986. Udayan Ghose Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believe these reasons might cause rates edge high mid-1990. For time being, losses Hugo ""will be substantial, they won't be something industry can't handle,"" say Charles L. Ruoff, director strategic planning Fred S. James & Co., New york-based insurance broker. For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimate it will pay claims total more $400 million homeowners and some small businesses. nationwide Insurance Co., mutual company base Columbus, Ohio, say Hugo ""is single large claims disaster"" it have see its 63-year history. The company, which be large home and auto insurer North Carolina and no. 3 South Carolina, have already receive 16,000 claims stricken region. Claims could total $100 million, spokesman said. For some insurers, Hugo be double-whammy. New york-based Continental Corp., which be big insurer Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, say it will take $50 million pretax charge earnings this quarter, reflect its net exposure damages cause hurricane. ""Hugo will be particularly costly us,"" say John P. Mascotte, Continental's chairman. philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which have extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations areas Hugo hit, and USF&G Corp. Baltimore, big insurer Carolina region, could also be force take one-time charges third-quarter earnings, analysts said. Some USF&G's losses hit very close home -- its Charleston office be destroy hurricane. Both USF&G and Cigna decline predict whether they would take charge; USF&G say it would be responsible first $22.5 million losses, and its reinsurance would cover bulk additional losses. Hugo could have marginal impact third-quarter income Travelers Corp., Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., accord industry analysts. Mr. Ruoff Fred S. James believe that if losses Hugo total much $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough ""financial pain, such not be able pay shareholder dividends,"" compel them boost premium rates right away. He explain that first six months this year, net income industry decline slightly 1988, insurance companies be still earn adequate rate return equity. He also note that industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently $125 billion, be also plentiful. Generally, insurers can book $3 premiums every $1 surplus. Right now, premiums total $200 billion, he said. An official Nationwide Insurance note that company have $1 surplus every $2 insurance that it writes.

Most companies, however, can cover the losses. Because South Carolina residents heeded evacuation warnings from the Hurricane Center, Hugo claimed only 17 lives in the state.","The two largest property insurance companies in the Carolinas, State Farm and Nationwide, estimate Hurricane Hugo losses at $600 million, making it the costliest hurricane ever.Hugo, a Category 4 storm dubbed a ""killer hurricane"" by Charleston's mayor, struck the city Thursday night. Though there was significant damage, only two were killed in Charleston, 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who heeded Hurricane Center warnings and evacuated before the storm's arrival.Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.","American Insurance Service Group says Hurricane Hugo, which ravaged the Caribbean and the Carolinas last week, is responsible for record hurricane losses. State Farm Insurance expects claims of approximately $500 million in the Carolinas. Nationwide Insurance is projecting claims near $100 million. Though the Hugo-related losses are substantial, most companies have sufficient funds to cover them. Some companies, however, will reduce third-quarter earnings.Hugo slammed into Charleston Thursday night with top winds of 135 mph. Upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane hours before it struck the historic city, it caused widespread damage throughout the Carolinas. Only two lives were lost in Charleston, however, and only 17 total in South Carolina. Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who monitored the hurricane and evacuated.  Computer models at the National Hurricane Center used satellite information to track Hugo's path into Charleston. Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, the governor declared a state of emergency and National Guardsmen were ordered to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and shorefront. Thousands fled inland or went to shelters.Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.",Forecasters Saved Lives During Deadly Hurricane Hugo,"Hurricane Hugo which hit Charleston, S.C. head-on the night of Sept. 21, 1989 was the costliest storm in the city's 300-year history. Despite widespread devastation (insured losses approached $5 billion) there were only 17 deaths in South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself thanks to accurate forecasting in time for an effective evacuation.","On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, South Carolina head-on with winds at 135 mph causing extensive property damage, but claiming only 17 lives in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself. The relatively low casualties were a result of an accurate prediction of the point of windfall by hurricane forecasters, effective evacuation measures and good response from residents. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion, by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area, but insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims.","Hurricane Hugo approached the Carolina coast on Sept. 21, 1989 with its windspeed up to 125 mph and threatened to hit between Savannah, GA and Charleston, S.C. It hit Charleston head-on with winds of 135 mph and then proceeded northwestward hitting other population centers rather than heading up the coast or out to sea as expected. Fortunately Hurricane forecasters analyzing computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane made an accurate educated guess as to the point of landfall in time for threatened residents to evacuate. As a result, only 17 deaths resulted in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston which took the brunt of the storm. Charleston had been through many hard times in its 300- year history, but Hugo was by far the worst hurricane in its experience. Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion but insurers were confident that they could handle all claims. Disaster aid came to Charleston from an unexpected source. Kingston, New York  raised funds to aid Charleston in thanks for 1,000 New York pounds sent by the South Carolina governor in 1778 to help the citizens of Kingston after it was burned by the British.",,,,

The telescope, silvery tube long tanker truck,has unmatched ability detect and capture faint light.light, speed 186,000 miles second, be themessenger creation. Tracking trail light today tothe first moments contain all information we will ever haveabout creation universe.The hubble promises give science open window perhaps tothe first echoes creation. This be world-class event, ifastronomy be not your thing.superlatives?in history optical astronomy there have be two greatleaps resolution universe: Galileo's telescope theautumn 1609, and hubble Space Telescope April 1990. Eric J. Chaisson, senior scientist Space Telescope ScienceInstitute Baltimore.One more?no one ever make anything that good, James Westphal,California Institute Technology.Another?Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predict that thehubble telescope will literally be dawn new era inastronomy.Eras rarely can be proclaim advance. But HST, namedafter Edwin Powell Hubble, hold that kind promise.hubble be astronomer first half century whoconcluded not only that distant galaxies be move away Earthbut that farther away they are, faster they move. Thetheory expand universe support belief that theuniverse originate cosmic explosion and that all matter isstill rush site that so-called Big Bang.Astronomers think Big Bang occur 12 billion 20 billionyears ago and send entire universe fly out incrediblespeed and heat. eventually matter cool and condense intogalaxies, stars and planets.There be big telescopes Hubble, they be all onearth and all subject major limitation atmosphere which be fine breathe lousy see through. Theproblem skywatching layers air have be liken tobirdwatching bottom swim pool.the Voyager spacecraft, which send back astonishing views ofearth's sister planets, have travel 12 years get close enoughfor pictures they whiz past. With Hubble, say scientistedward Weiler, such pictures be possible any time we want.the telescope be 42.5 14 feet and consist 94.5-inchprimary mirror that gathers incoming light.on clear, dark night you can see flashlight two milesaway, say Weiler, chief NASA scientist Hubble project.with 28-power telescope you can see it moon 250,000miles away.

It doesn't matter what day welaunch Hubble, it matter that we do it right.the telescope be 43 feet long and 14 feet diameter, thesize railroad tank car. When it fly free, it will receiveelectrical power its six scientific instruments twowing-like solar arrays that extend outward each side.it be name late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whotheorized that universe be expand and that farther awaya galaxy is, fast it be traveling. That give support thetheory that massive explosion Big Bang create theuniverse 10 20 billion years ago.the Hubble be expect help provide answer two majorquestions: How old be universe? How big be it?the telescope have two mirrors, one 94.5 inches diameter, theother 12 inches. Two instruments be cameras, two arespectrometers and one be photometer. In addition, finepointing system act sixth instrument provide precisemeasurement distances.on Wednesday, Hawley be grapple 12{-ton telescope withthe shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out cargo bay, pointit, and long checkout drop it overboard orbit itsown.in cargo bay, telescope receive electrical power fromthe shuttle. But juice be cut when instrument be lift outand it will depend internal batteries solar panels areextended receive light sun.Should solar panels not deploy, mission specialists BruceMcCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be stand by, partiallydressed space suits, ready go open cargo bay tounfurl array manually.Discovery's launch be not its problems.with 31 seconds leave countdown, computer that runsthe final moments liftoff refuse close fuel valve andstopped launch process. The problem be overcome and theshuttle lift 8:34 a.m. EDT, three minutes late.the shuttle be schedule land Sunday 9:49 a.m. EDT atEdwards Air Force Base California.On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, theshuttle's windshield be splatter several flecks ofthings. He say windshield be streak debris andthat it also be smear when spent booster rockets fell offduring climb orbit.the astronauts also have problems their UHF radio circuit,and one ship's small rear thrusters be inoperative. Neitherproblem be consider serious.discovery's astronauts overcamebalky equipment send hubble Space Telescope float freefrom shuttle today 15-year quest secrets theuniverse.the $1.5 billion telescope begin orbit Earth every 97.3minutes altitude 380 miles high atmosphere,which have limit view ground-based telecopes.discovery, go hubble release, Mission Control tell thecrew 3:37 p.m. EDT.

Shrivermaneuvered shuttle its deployment position, its nosepointed sun. That be put telescope's solararrays, once unfurled, proper angle quickly startcollecting energy and protect telescope's fix star trackerswhile instrument be be hold payload bay.discovery be orbit 380 miles earth, 70 miles higherthan any previous shuttle. The orbit be dictate need toput telescope Earth's distort atmosphere.for those technically inclined this morning, I'd passon quote day on-board astronomer (hawley),something effect that big marble sure look far awaytoday, Shriver said.the five astronauts' busy day begin musical note early thismorning Mission Control play song call Space be OurWorld, write members Discovery's training team and ahouston-area group, Private Numbers.Controllers monitor telescope Goddard Space FlightCenter Maryland say Tuesday that no problems have be detectedso far Hubble, most expensive and complex unmannedspacecraft ever built.everything have just be go clockwork, say RonSchlagheck, shift director orbital verifications Goddard.Everybody be excellent spirits.the Hubble telescope, delay technical problems and 1986Challenger accident, have wait seven years take its place inspace. It finally get ride orbit Tuesday morning aboarddiscovery.hubble will allow astronomers study stars and galaxies sodistant their light have take 14 billion years reach Earth. Itis expect provide clues age and size universe,and it may solve mysteries quasars, pulsars and black holesand find stars planets that could conceivably supportlife.the 24,250-pound telescope be 43 feet long and 14 feet indiameter, size railroad tank car. When it be inorbit, it will receive electrical power its six scientificinstruments two winglike solar arrays.it be name late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whosediscovery 1920s that universe be expand give riseto Big Bang theory that universe be create atremendous explosion 10 billion 20 billion years ago.the hubble Space Telescope wasawakened its self-induced sleep today it be still withoutthe use its high-speed antennas, and its science instrumentswere hold, unable begin any observations.We be out `safe-mode' right now, say Steve Terry, asupervisor engineers control telescope. He say thetelescope be run normal control-all mode, where itsown computers and sensors guide where it be pointing.discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, pack their gear areturn Earth Sunday, make some last-minute observations Earthand talk ground-based reporters their flight.pilot Charles Bolden say he be especially upbeat thewidespread public awareness telescope, which be expectedeventually look back 14 billion light years nearly thebirth universe.it's hard go somewhere and find someone who have never heardof hubble Space Telescope, say Bolden. It make littlekids' eyes light up. It make little kids want learn how addand subtract and study science.the telescope's big eye have remain open, Hubble have beenin safe mode all motion stop because earlierproblems link high-speed dish antennas relaysatellite. The antennas be primary links relayingscientific data ground.terry say that safe mode, one tape recordersin telescope reads telemetry signals all its systems andthat these would be play Earth and analyze when antennasare work properly.We expect use that data investigate what happened, hesaid. Engineers be able send commands telescope itssecondary antennas communications system be not useful forscientific data, which must be transmit high rate speed.We're put scientific instruments hold mode, ineffect standby mode, he said.shortly 6 a.m. EDT, controllers Goddard SpaceFlight Center Greenbelt, Md., complete series commandsthat take telescope out its safe mode and then begin runa 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health.it will take another day $1.5 billion telescope isoperating way it be suppose this point startupprocess, say hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.We're back very deliberate and slow and carefulapproach these problems, Olivier say Friday. This be notthe time do anything dumb.the telescope problems have put flight center several daysbehind, five astronauts who deploy it earlier this weekwere stick their schedule.landing be schedule 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday Edwards AirForce Base, Calif., flight controllers be keep closewatch weather.Winds be predict be 20 mph gusts 29 mph.mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph attouchdown.the shuttle carry enough supplies stay orbit three daysbeyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.mission Control awaken crew members 1:30 a.m. edttoday play song, Cosmos.Thanks wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate fortoday, say Commander Loren Shriver.The song be select honor hubble Space Telescope,which be now open business, say Mission Control commentatorjames Hartsfield.The astronauts be finish their experiments andphotography today and pack trip home. They also plan tohold news conference space reporters JohnsonSpace Center.Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden be run series oftests make certain shuttle's computers and control jets wereready return Earth.The crew deploy hubble Wednesday they have stay closeto telescope case there be trouble open aperturedoor. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivanwere prepare perform space walk today crank it open inorbit 380 miles Earth.But that prove unnecessary when door be open Fridaymorning, expose telescope's finely polish 94.5-inch eye tostarlight first time.two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stoppedworking when door opened, engineers later get them back online. The gyroscopes be knock out motion and that, too,kept telescope safe mode, say Dave Drachlis, directorof orbital verifications Goddard.A colleague, Steve Terry, say Hubble's systems be set atconservative limits first operations and that cause manymalfunctions.

The system still had problems but great potential.","Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth.","Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.",,,,,,,,

It be also withoutdoubt most gruelling. Run high heat, high humidity, high pollutionlevels and extraordinary course, Barcelona Olympic men'smarathon will prove one most physically demand ever run. There arelots figures show why. It be estimate that when race begin inmataro, seaside town north Barcelona, temperature will be analready-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards marathon's end, however, radiantheat thrown buildings could be subject runners atemperature 30`C. more debilitating still, relative humidity inbarcelona August rise high 80 cent.

But we do not need figures convince us extraordinarydifficulty tomorrow's race. last Saturday, Olympic stadium, Iwatched final moments and aftermath women's marathon, begin atthe same time day and run similar conditions. Never any eventvoluntarily enter into, sport or otherwise, have I see such signs ofphysical and mental distress. The race be win Unified Team'sValentina Yegorova 2 hours 32 minutes, time considerably slow thanthat achieve women less demand Olympic marathon courses LosAngeles and Seoul. After her near competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, camein eight seconds later, they have energy - bouts grimace andlowering their heads their knees - embrace each other and smile forthe cameras.it be different story 'mixed zone,' area stadiumwhere athletes recover their events.

These be not sort scenes likely promote enthusiasm formarathon run or ideals Olympic competition.chris Brasher, organiser London marathon, be hand witness thesuffering, and be incensed. Male marathon runners will face same kindof problems heat, humidity, and over-demanding terrain, he said.in his opinion, gear marathon prime-time tv viewing and have theevent end top hill sake stadium spectators wasunjustified and 'sell-out commercialism.'to put marathon late afternoon, rather first thing inthe morning (the normal practice), and then make them run 4km hillis just criminal my opinion,' say Brasher, former Olympic gold medalathlete and note sportswriter.I speak Britain's Steve Brace, winner Paris marathon 1989 and1990, Berlin marathon last year and competitor Barcelona event.he agree that run will be highly demanding, and while he regardsolympic marathon run pinnacle his career, he be cautious abouttomorrow's slog.like almost all athletes run tomorrow, Brace be professionalrunner who specialise marathons. He take objective, long-term viewof his profession. As income-earner, marathon run be activity withliabilities and limitations, and require business management well asphysical ability.the winner London marathon earn tidy Dollars 50,000 and NewYork, Boston and japanese runs be all same prize-winning category.but these and less financially-rewarding events be physically debilitating,and can only be win if competitor be top physical shape.with their careers and financial prospects mind, top-level runnersnormally only run two marathons year. As Brace says, when you have onlytwo pay-days out 365, you choose, plan and train them greatcare.brace trains extremely carefully indeed. 'running marathon be easypart,' he says. 'The hard part be lead-up achieve performancelevel required.' He start train three months event running80 miles week and then build progressively. For last six weeks heruns 120 miles week.normally he would hope that such routine brings pay-off. But Olympicmarathon be exception: only top-level marathon that carry no prizemoney. Brace say that spite prestige and possible financialspin-offs involved, 'it do not necessarily make sense run win.'given highly demand nature course and their desire preservephysical condition races that do bring money, he says, many runnerswill give less their best effort.nonetheless, there be plenty whose considerations stretch purelyfinancial. italian Gelindo Bordin, who come first 1988 Seoul Olympicmarathon, be strong contender. so be Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who camethird Seoul. Ibrahim Hussein Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi Japan arealso possible winners.none them, though, will make molehill out steep and formidableascent Montjuic.A crowd size small city will squeeze start line here March 1 run 26 miles, 385 yards. And cheer every step that distance will be more dozen corporate sponsors and licensees. Makers cars, soda pop, sportswear, copiers, computers -- hospital -- have tag their names Los Angeles Marathon. In promoter's words, this run be ""a market event legs,"" reflect marathoning's grow importance upscale product promotions. Runners, it seems, be well-heeled lot. A study Mercedes-Benz find that 42% family heads make $40,000 year or more jog regularly. Of potential buyers show Mercedes dealers, 47% be joggers. With those numbers mind, car maker have become sponsor three marathons -- New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- well other run races. Marathons have have corporate backing some time. But Los Angeles be ahead pack make distance run commercial spectacle. The city that invent corporate-sponsored Olympics have create marathon -- artfully dress olympic-type amateur race, build ground make money closely hold company that control it -- well city. ""I take air and make event,"" say William Burke, founder and president Los Angeles Marathon Inc. For man whose running days end his high school track team, Mr. Burke be turn lot heads world marathoning. last year, its first time out, Los Angeles race attract nearly 11,000 runners -- four times number forecast and enough make it third -- large race U.S. The event also pull $4 million cash and services its sponsors, leave organizers $370,000 red ink. This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect gross $5 million cash and services and break even. Next year, they say, profit be possible. more 18,000 runners be expect this year. An audience perhaps million and half or more will line route, drawn part advertisements 75 million coca-cola cans and 2,500 billboards Los Angeles area. market experts say festive atmosphere big crowd streets make marathons attractive sponsors. For cost 30-second ad Super Bowl, company can sponsor marathon and ""take city,"" say Lesa Ukman, editor special Events Reports, chicago-based newsletter. The Los Angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps do more their counterparts elsewhere publicize event. Los Angelenos be see plugs race millions grocery bags, milk cartons and loaves bread, addition soda cans, billboards and other sources. The venerable New York Marathon be take note. The New York Road Runners Club, organizer race, stop promote event some years ago because it have all runners it wanted. Now, Fred Lebow, group's president, say he be encouraging sponsors promote race Los Angeles sponsors do. The promotion Los Angeles be unabashed. ""We tell people that if they're look new way crack Los Angeles market, this be it,"" say Mr. Burke. The pitch have attract likes Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Los Angeles; Vons Cos., large supermarket chain; Los Angeles Times; Sears Savings Bank unit Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc. One supporter be Ellesse USA, sportswear and shoe producer. A $50,000 fee enables company use marathon's name its ads; Ellesse will spend additional $100,000 dress race personnel T-shirts and warm-up suits, show its clothes marathon's public ""Expo"" sponsors' wares, and post dozen big street banners course. The company have rent more 500 billboards cut-rate price $120,000 Patrick Media Group, marathon sponsor. The discount, 50%, be important. ""we couldn't have buy that kind exposure normally,"" say Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director. Ellesse, which also sponsor New York run, find West Coast event more freewheeling. ""They have let us do we want,"" say Ms. Cialone. For instance, product banners route -- almost impossible arrange New York -- be snap Los Angeles. The city, fact, be partner race. After competitive bidding, it award eight-year contract Los Angeles Marathon Inc. put race. The exclusive franchise call race organizers this year pay minimum $60,000 fee or 4% gross cash receipts city. The organizers also will pay cost city services marathon, estimate $100,000. The race sponsors and city officials be trade freely good will generate Los Angeles's role host 1984 Olympics. The logo marathon be shield laurel wreath. Some posters show Los Angeles Coliseum its torch and giant Olympic symbol. ""The World Returns Los Angeles,"" proclaim one Mercedes-Benz ad. Race directors be call ""commissioners,"" term borrow 1984 Olympic organization, which Mr. Burke be commissioner tennis. And Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portray race civic celebration, thrives volunteers. Some 7,500 people will work free monitor course race day. And two-thirds race's office staff work pay. ""i couldn't buy this,"" Mr. Burke says, gesture crowd race headquarters. not everyone work free. big-name runners, instance, want be pay lot. And here, organizers have pinch pennies. While some runners will be pay appear, this year's field, last year's, lack some superstars who race Boston, New York and London. Grete Waitz, one best woman marathoners, want $100,000 appear Los Angeles; she be turn down. Mr. Burke say australian runner Rob de Castella make it know his agent that he wouldn't run any marathons spring but, $25,000, he'd be happy say Los Angeles event be tempting. Mr. Burke say he slam phone. ""We won't spend extraordinary amounts money any single runner detriment other runners,"" he says. Mr. de Castella's agent deny story entirely. What Los Angeles lack superstars, it plan make numbers. This year's race may challenge New York and London large marathon ever run. Some 20,500 start New York race last year. Mr. Lebow, organizer New York event, say next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number. For one sponsor, this may be mixed blessing. Orthopaedic Hospital, not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship be part publicity campaign, provide emergency care stations marathon route. last year, one every 20 runners need aid. Along sprains, strains and blisters come more serious cases exhaustion and hypothermia.

She added:i'm sure sun shin straight down, Jesse's watch us,too.the 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't when advertisers begin clamor pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton. She go grin relentlessly some $5 million worth commercial endorsements -- surely Olympic record itself. But when 1988 Summer Games end Sunday night, so, too, chance american athletes follow her footsteps. Ad agency executives, who spend every fourth year glue their tv sets, hop pick out next star hawk their clients' products, say that this Olympiad be dud. ""i suspect this will go dull history Olympics,"" say Jerry Della Femina, chairman ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS. ""This be first Olympics passion, and passion you don't have testimonials. Without heroes, you don't have anyone that anyone want emulate."" On surface, Games seem offer all drama that make lucrative endorsement contracts. Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smack his head springboard, then come back win two gold medals? Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, her two-inch fingernails rake air she win 100-meter sprint? But these two, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who win women's heptathalon and long jump, may find it more difficult previous years turn gold medals gold bank. The fact is, say many marketers, Olympic gold have lose much its commercial luster. ""i don't think it's big money it use be,"" say Michael Goldberg National Media Group Inc., New York sports-marketing firm that represent Ms. Retton. ""It use be kind knee-jerk reaction do ad campaign Olympic athlete. It just doesn't happen anymore."" Certainly, this year's win Olympians will have no trouble secure contracts specialize sports-equipment outfitters and speak invitations obscure trade groups. But major, high-paying endorsements -- such those soft-drink companies and fast-food outlets -- just don't seem be surfacing, least not yet. Earlier this year, sports marketers estimate that gold medal win Summer Games could earn personable athlete more $1 million endorsements. Now, marketers say, these medalists will be lucky pull $100,000 $500,000 year. Advertisers can reel litany reasons why these Olympics aren't ignite much spark. For one thing, they suffer comparison 1984 Summer Games, so exciting because they be hold Los Angeles and because, absence boycott Soviet-bloc countries, Americans win 83 gold medals. The 1988 Games, contrast, be broadcast halfway world, and Soviets trounce Americans, 55 gold medals 36. What's more, marketers say, this year's drug scandals cast pall Games, especially incident involve canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who lose his gold medal test positive steroids. NBC's tv coverage also get its share blame. Marketers say it be so bland and skip so frequently one event another that there be little chance excitement build. The constant commercial interruptions, which lead ratings that be much low expected, didn't help, either. During most Games, ""there be enough continuous tv coverage so that, much soap opera, it be possible get involve lives and competition,"" say Leigh Steinberg, attorney ice-skater Brian Boitano, gold medalist 1988 Winter Games. But not this summer, he says. Recent changes Olympic rules, meanwhile, have lead glut Olympians search endorsement deals. Before 1984 Games, most Olympic athletes weren't allow make commercials unless they give their amateur status. Now, they can appear many ads they want, income must go trust fund training expenses. ""every year, more and more olympic people be out there want do commercials -- basically, everybody be available,"" say Daisy Sinclair, vice president ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As result, while once ""aura"" surround Olympian, now ""the bloom be off."" Companies also be become more sophisticated their approach celebrity endorsements. increasingly cost conscious, they will no longer hook olympian just because company president likes athlete's sport. And years pay big bucks Olympic star only see them fade obscurity, companies have finally get hint that olympian fame be most fleeting variety. ""if you think your phone will ring hook if (you win) gold medal, it isn't go happen anymore,"" say Stephen Disson, senior vice president marketing ProServ Inc., Washington sports-marketing firm. Companies now know that ""six months now there will be other heroes other sport events"" them consider. Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude Olympics be become typical. It use sports star its commercials Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds have no plans call any 1988's Olympians. ""I prefer use athletes who be public eye regular basis, football and basketball players,"" say Charles Miesmer, agency's executive creative director. ""people Michael Jordan have 10-plus years their sports careers, all row, so I don't have worry public saying, 'Carl who?'"" And don't look any 1988's winners start show Wheaties boxes, either. General Mills Inc., which have feature Ms. Retton and decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner its Wheaties boxes past, say it look three qualities endorser: career achievement, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishments. A spokeswoman say that none this year's crop meet all three criteria. so far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee have have most visible endorsements. even Olympics began, she have make commercials Primatene mist and 7-up. And, accord her agent, Pearl Hodge World Class Management, she be now ""in process"" sign McDonald's Corp., work behalf its efforts aid underprivileged children. Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take endorsement lead. Advertisers say her good looks and fashion flare, she be attract more interest any other medal winners. (The sprinter's manager couldn't be reach comment.) Another olympian endorsement potential be swimmer Matt Biondi, who win five gold medals. Mr. Biondi have already sign swim-wear contract Arena USA Inc., and Parkes Brittain, his agent Advantage International Inc., say his client ""will definitely be high-income ring, high you can name."" then there be Mr. Louganis. Since win two gold medals 1984 Summer Olympics, diver have have little luck major endorsements. And few marketing executives say that his second sweep dive events may not his potential. ""when most advertisers be look male hero, word 'macho' trails very closely,"" say Marty Blackman Blackman & Raber, sports-marketing firm New York. ""I don't find Louganis macho guy."" Still, other marketing professionals say that Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery smash his head have secure diver's future. His manager, Jim Babbitt, won't comment any contract offers. He will say, however, that his client have ""done just fine. He isn't unhappy. He dive perform; he doesn't dive dollars."" ---winning EndorsementsThere be only one former olympian top sports endorsers last year.athlete: Arnold Palmer (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Hertz, PaineWebber, Pennzoil, United Airlines, GTE, Toro, Loft Seed Co., Sears, Pro Group, Robert Bruce, Westin HotelsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $8 millionathlete: Jack Nicklaus (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Bostonian Shoe Co., Hart Schaffner & Marx, Optique Du Monde, Pine Hosiery Mills, WarnacoESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionATHLETE: Boris Becker (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Coca-Cola, Deutsche Bank, Polaroid, UNICEFESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $6 millionathlete: Greg Norman (Golf)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Reebok, Spalding, Epson Computers, Hertz, Qantas Airlines, Daikyo Group, Swan Lager & Castlemaine, Akubia HatsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4.5 millionathlete: Michael Jordan (Basketball, 1984 Olympian)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Nike, Wilson, Excelsior, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Johnson Products, Ohio ArtESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $4 millionathlete: Ivan Lendl (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Gleneagles Country Club, Avis, Seiko, Adidas, Bow Brand StringsESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionathlete: John Madden (Former football coach)national ENDORSEMENTS: Ace Hardware, Miller Lite, Ramada, Exxon, Canon, GreyhoundESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionathlete: Jim McMahon (Football)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Taco Bell, Kraft Foods, Ebel Watches, Honda, Adidas, LJN Toys, Revo SunglassesESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $3 millionathlete: Dennis Conner (Yachting)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Rayban, Sperry Topsider, Wrigley's, Disney, Lacoste, Pepsi-ColaESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Chris Evert (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Lipton Iced Tea, Wilson Converse, Ellesse, Polo Club Boca Raton, Rolex, Evert Active Life Skin Care, Marchon Sunwear EllesseESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionATHLETE: Martina Navratilova (Tennis)NATIONAL ENDORSEMENTS: Puma, Lufthansa Airlines, Vuarnet, DHL, Sugar-Free Jello, Aspen Club, RKO Video, World Tennis MagazineESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionathlete: Jackie Stewart (retired race car driver)national ENDORSEMENTS: Ford, Goodyear, USF&G, Rolex, Gleneagles, American Express, British Telecom, ICCIESTIMATED 1987 EARNINGS: $2 millionsource: Sports Marketing NewsletterDebi Thomas' dream Olympic goldturned disappointment Saturday East Germany's Katarina Wittwon her second straight Olympic championship and canadian ElizabethManley take home silver crowd cheer countrymen.it's over.

It can also bring disgrace to those caught using drugs.  Nations as well as individuals share the honors.  The former Soviet Union seemed to always top the ""most-medals-won"" list.  However, the U.S. superstars enjoy the most fame.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  It is here that national pride is displayed, individual dreams are realized and fame is attained.  The summer Olympics with its gymnastics, track and field, and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis, some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts.  The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters, speed skaters and downhill skiers.  Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame, as happened to Jesse Owens, who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler's ""master race"" competitors.","In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.  True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.  But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.  Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.  National pride is a factor.  The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.  The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.  However, among those ""third-most"" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.  The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long-lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.","Olympic Games: Good or Bad, But Always Center Stage","The US has had many Olympic heroes such as Jesse Owens in 1936, and FlorenceGriffith Joyner, Carl Lewis,, and Greg Louganis more recently.  But US teamshave not always won the most medals, losing mostly to the Soviets.  Thegames generate greatest interest in the US when their teams dominate.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games withfew medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired betterbut was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drugusage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included theflamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late JesseOwens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluentnations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.","The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the 1988 Games.  Theonly gold medal winners were Brian Boitano in figure skating and BonnieBlair in speed skating.  Debi Thomas, the US hope in figure skating had tosettle for a bronze after East Germany's Katarina Witt took gold andCanadian Elizabeth Manley the silver.  The Seoul Summer Games were a muchbrighter arena for the US with multiple gold medal winners, but the Sovietswere the overall winners.  Drug usage disqualified several athletes, mostnotably Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson.  Because the US showing did not equaltheir domination in the Los Angeles Games four years earlier (boycotted bythe Soviets) and because of unimaginative TV coverage, lucrative endorsementcontracts did not appear to be forthcoming for the winners.The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Games was honored with aCongressional Gold Medal, which was given to his widow by President Bush.Teams from affluent nations usually dominate Olympic relay events, and thatwas expected to happen in Barcelona in 1992.  The US has an imposing groupof runners in those events.In non-Olympic years, World Cup and World University Games featured manysuccessful Olympic athletes.",,,,

They all oughtto be eliminated, retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque Centerfor Defense Information say Thursday. I don't know what more ittakes get people recognize this ancient technology be nolonger appropriate warships.but Navy defend 16-inch gun, mighty use onany ocean, explosion kill 47 sailors Wednesday aboardthe battleship Iowa while turret crew load gunpowder targetpractice.this gun ... remain fine naval gun world. It wasthe pinnacle gun design art, and it be still front-linesystem, say Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander Iowa untillast May.The main criticism be that big gun require gunpowder packedin silk bags fire 16-inch-diameter shells its 62-foot-longbarrel. It work breech-loaded guns that roar thecivil War: A shell be place barrel and then charge withgunpowder separate package.in Iowa's case, 660 pounds powder six 110-pound bags be needed fire projectile weigh 2,700 pounds aspeed 2,500 feet second. An electric spark ignite thepowder.the extremely flammable silk be suppose burn away theburst, some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases canbuild barrel. Air pressurize 3,000 pounds squareinch can be blow breech clear away debris guardagainst blowback, which happen when powder ignite beforethe breech be closed.in new guns, powder be pack metal containers. Missiles,the backbone modern Navy's attack capability, haveintegrated propellants.capt. James Bush Center Defense Information, aprivate think tank critical Pentagon policy, say Iowaexplosion could have be cause smolder debris, blowbackor mishap handle powder.it wasn't unexpected.

These be only gun inthe Navy that still use bag powder.the Navy say Thursday that none guns Iowa turrethad be fire explosion take place.the Navy also Thursday place moratorium firing bigguns, find only Iowa and its three sister battleships, thenew Jersey, Wisconsin and Missouri.In large sense, critics say battleships themselves, oncethe mainstay gunboat diplomacy, have outlive their purpose.despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, battlewagons arevulnerable submarine and missile attack. The 20-mile range ofthe 16-inch gun be almost worthless era when missiles can befired much great distances.we can do almost anything missile and do it better,bush said.Battleships reach their heyday World War I and wereintended fight other ships.the Iowa, first launch 1942, be first entireclass U.S. battlewagons build conquer Japan.It support Marine amphibious landings and shell shoretargets, aircraft carrier emerge Navy's top weaponbecause naval battles be wag ships ever see eachother.

Theywere upgrade Tomahawk cruise missiles, 20mm guns and Harpoonmissiles.One battleships, New Jersey, bombard syrian anddruze positions Lebanon part U.S. peacekeeping role in1983. But 16-inch guns miss their targets, which thenavy blame unreliable powder World War II.There be no military need return these ships activeduty, say CDI's LaRocque. Their only military utility isto bombard Third World countries, and era gunboat diplomacyis over.the scarred battleship USS Iowa make asomber return Sunday its home port, where 3,000 familymembers and friends crew welcomed love ones who escape anexplosion that kill 47 sailors.Sailors white black arm bands line rails thehuge vessel dock Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 5:41 p.m.,just one minute later Navy officials have estimated.

New york-based American International Group Inc. expect net losses relate Hugo reduce pretax earnings $35 million and $45 million. Analysts say AIG have tell them that it must cover first $35 million losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover bulk remain damages. AIG insure property Puerto Rico, eastern Caribbean Islands and coastal regions Carolinas. St. Paul Cos., base St. Paul, Minn, say pretax cost Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount take consideration what St. Paul expect recover its reinsurance contracts, company said. philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. be expect disclose Hugo's likely impact its earnings sometime today. Udayan Ghose, insurance industry analyst Shearson Lehman Hutton New York, estimate that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduce 50 cents and 65 cents share after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% 40% his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate third quarter. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. say its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimate claim payments Hugo will exceed $400 million South Carolina alone, far surpass company's record payout single disaster. When damages North Carolina and Virginia be added, company said, payments will exceed $500 million. It say that be more three times previous record $165 million set Hurricane Alicia, which hit Houston-Galveston, Texas, area 1983.The greenhouse effect may breed big anddeadlier hurricanes future, storms 50 percent strongerthan Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, somemeteorologists say.hugo blast eastern Caribbean and Carolinas 135 mphwinds this week, kill least 41 people.just Hugo strike U.S. coast, its pressure be measuredat 940 millibars.

And I think there be better-than-even odds that you willhave strong hurricanes.emanuel say if ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanesof future could grow Gilbert's strength and future Gilbertswill be stronger.gilbert be so strong that Bob Sheets, director nationalhurricane center, say forecasters may have use intensityscale 1-6 future, instead current 1-5, fivethe highest.the computer models schneider use show that worst-casescenario, next 100 years world's temperature could jumpby 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas which bothcontribute greenhouse effect continue pour theatmosphere unchecked.it be possible that though world whole heat up,the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler.

It killed 17 in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the Gulf Stream.","Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane. It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. The storm claimed 17 lives in the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida. There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress. Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult. State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.  The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.  Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo.

Stronger Storms Forecast.,"On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger than Hugo in the future.","After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded $750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.","September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless. It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph. Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm. Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million. As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast. Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place. Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives. Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science. Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing.

It quickly overran the Kuwaiti capital and then continued on to southern oil facilities.  The United States led the United Nations in condemning this action and imposing tough economic and military sanctions.","Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions by exceeding OPEC production quotas thus driving down oil prices.  He further accused Kuwait of ""stealing"" Iraqi oil from a common oil field on their border.  He then invaded Kuwait, claiming to do so at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  The United States led the western world and the United Nations in calling the coup a sham, denouncing this invasion and imposing strong economic and military sanctions on Iraq in an attempt to get them to withdraw.  Oil prices surged while Saddam warned against foreign intervention.  The U.S. dispatched warships to the area.","It appeared that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was determined to solve his countries financial problems and territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.  Iraq emerged from its 1980-1988 war with Iran with a debt of approximately $80 billion.  Saddam accused Kuwait of costing Iraq billions in oil revenues by exceeding OPEC assigned oil quotas, thus driving down the price of oil.  He further accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil from an oil field common to their border and also of conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq economically and militarily.  Breaking off perfunctory negotiations with Kuwait, Iraq invaded, claiming it responded to a request for help from Kuwaiti revolutionary coup leaders.  Iraq quickly overwhelmed a mismatched Kuwaiti military, captured the capital and continued south to the oil facilities.  The United States called the coup a farce.  Kuwait's U.S. ambassador asked the United States to intervene militarily.  U.S. President George Bush called for an ""immediate and unconditional"" withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

Iraq retaliated by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait.",Saddam Hussein Defied United States and United Nations,"On August 2, 1990, after Saddam Hussein had charged Kuwait with unfriendly acts, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic moves by the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, Iraq remained defiant and moved troops toward the Saudi Arabian border. As of August 6, 1990 the situation was ominous.","In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border. The two countries agreed to talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives walked out. The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of them to Iraq. As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.","On July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPECproduction quotas and of stealing oil from wells along the countries'disputed border. Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a""short-notice exercise"" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would notbe intimidated by U.S. pressure. Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwaitagreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq hadmassed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. The next day Iraq pulledout of the talks and on August 2,1990 invaded and quickly occupied allof Kuwait. President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blockedmost Iraqi imports. The U.N. Security Council denounced the invasionand demanded Iraq's withdrawal. The Pentagon stepped up air patrolsand movement of warships into the Persian Gulf.

42,d075b,"The expensive practice use ballooncatheters force open heart arteries immediately heartattacks, now routinely do many large hospitals, be unnecessaryand should be abandoned, accord major study release Tuesday.The study find that if heart attack victims quickly receiveclot-dissolving drugs, they don't need extra step thecommon balloon procedure, know angioplasty.some experts say results be good news, because they meanthat most heart attack patients can be treat communityhospitals, where angioplasty be not available.the study also have important financial message. Its authorsestimated that if angioplasty be widely adopt heartattacks, it could raise nation's annual medical bills $704million.this trial have settle one most important questions inmodern-day cardiology, comment Dr. J. Ward Kennedy theuniversity Washington, Seattle.The study be phase 2 Thrombolysis Miocardial InfarctionTrial, or TIMI-II, direct Dr. Eugene Braunwald Brigham andWomen's Hospital Boston.The first phase study show that give people aclot-dissolving drug call tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA,immediately heart attack dramatically improve their chancesof survival.the late study, present annual meeting AmericanHeart Association, be intend see whether people betterstill if doctors try clear away any remain blockages aftergiving TPA.At 50 hospitals United States, doctors randomlyassigned 1,636 patients get angioplasty two days theirheart attacks if tests show there be any chance they mightbenefit. Sixty percent them actually underwent procedure,which temporarily inflate balloons dangerously narrow heartarteries squeeze them open.A comparison group 1,626 also get TPA. But they be notconsidered angioplasty unless they have linger heart pain orabnormal exercise tests their recovery.after 42 days, 11 percent those angioplasty group haddied or suffer further heart attacks, 10 percent thosein comparison group.a year treatment, there be no difference survival.about 93 percent groups be still alive.there do not appear be any additional benefit fromangioplasty, Braunwald said.dr. Thomas J. Ryan Boston University Medical Center commented,we have answer this trial very important question ofhealth care delivery.While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs heartattack patients, most them do not have sophisticate labswhere angioplasty be performed.if study have find that immediate angioplasty improvessurvival, it would have mean that many more angioplasty labs wouldneed be establish and more doctors train give theprocedure.the watch word be watchful wait see if patients needangioplasty. This ultimately make it possible patients betreated community hospitals and be transfer terciary carecenters if angioplasty be needed, say Dr. Howard Morgan,immediate president heart association.heart attacks occur when clot blocks artery that feeds theheart muscle. The purpose TPA and similar drugs be dissolvethese clots muscle dies. To be effective, drugs mustbe give four hours start heart attacksymptoms.Experts say that only 20 percent heart attack victimsare consider be candidates drugs. many people delaygoing hospital permanent damage occurs. In others, thetreatment may be consider too dangerous because recent surgeryor history strokes.balloon angioplasty be also widely use treat people withclogged heart arteries who have not suffer heart attacks. Thelatest study not question usefulness this kind ofangioplasty.deaths heart and blood vesseldisease drop 24 percent decade, it remain byfar nation's big killer, take life every 32 seconds, theamerican Heart Association say Sunday.The good news be that we continue see improvement thedeath rate big killer our population, say Dr.Bernadine Healy Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who be presidentof heart association.those trends be dramatic and don't seem be reversing, shesaid. The bad news be that heart disease be still kill almost 1million Americans year, and we've get long way go.the association release statistics its annual forum forscience writers.Experts attribute decline death rates combination ofhealthier live habits, include few cigarettes and good food,and improve medical treatment.The public ought appreciate progress that have be madein heart disease 20 years, say Dr. Myron L.Weisfeldt Johns Hopkins University. It's almost unbelievable.There be almost no form heart disease that we can't approachwithout meaningful treatment.however, Weisfeldt, who be president-elect heartassociation, also caution that much work remains, inimproving care and encouraging people take good care theirhealth.i believe we can prevent least 50 percent ischemicheart disease United States year 2000 if we stopsmoking, get cholesterol treat if it's 220, and identify andtreat hypertension, he said.ischemic heart disease be clog blood vessels that feedthe heart. It underlie most heart attacks, single most lethalheart ailment.association figures indicate that 1986 most recent yearfor which there be statistics estimate 978,500 Americans diedfrom heart attacks, strokes and other diseases heart andblood vessels. Cancer, no. 2 killer, take 466,000 lives.between 1976 and 1986, death rate all forms ofcardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It decline 28 percent forheart attacks and 40 percent strokes.the association's figures show that more one fouramericans suffers some form cardiovascular disease, and almosthalf those eventually die it.about 60 percent heart attack deaths occur thevictim reaches hospital. Studies show that half allheart attack victims wait more two hours get anemergency room.weisfeldt say major health goal be get people go thehospital three or four hours first sign heartattacks. During this period, there be still time give them drugsto dissolve blood clots that be cause their heart attacks.This treatment can live and reduce disability heartattacks.other major goals, he said, include find ways improve theeffectiveness angioplasty, technique that use balloons openclogged heart arteries, and find surgical and medical techniquesto identify and protect people risk cardiac arrest.The heart association estimate that cardiovascular disease willcost $88.2 billion this year medical expenses and lose wages.among other statistics release association:The most common cardiovascular disease be high blood pressure,which affect 60 million Americans.About 200,000 deaths cardiovascular disease eachyear occur people age 65.There be 1,418 heart transplants 1987, almost nine times asmany 1983.About 2.5 million Americans have angina, chest painresulting clogged heart arteries. About 300,000 new cases occurannually.as many 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks thisyear.a drug that ease heart's workload cancut risk new cardiac attacks and death 20 percent inpeople recover heart attacks, accord major studyreleased Thursday.The study, conduct Denmark, find that drug Verapamil,known calcium channel blocker, be effective 1{ yearsafter heart attack. Calcium blockers be several classes ofmedicines commonly prescribe relieve high blood pressure.this be first trial that indicate that calcium blockermay be beneficial acute myocardial infarction, or heartattack, say Dr. Carl J. Pepine University Florida.Several other studies calcium blockers, include one largeu.s. study publish last year, fail find any benefit fromusing medicines heart attacks.according danish study, Verapamil be effectiveas another variety blood pressure medicines know betablockers protect people heart attacks.While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers heartattacks, researchers say these drugs still should have rolein treatment.We feel it be important have alternatives. many patients donot tolerate beta blockers, say Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard ofcentral County Hospital Hillerod, Denmark, co-author thestudy.beta blockers be generally not recommended people withasthma and emphysema. This mean drugs cannot be give tocigarette smokers, who be frequent victims heart attacks.in study, conduct 20 community hospitals, doctorscompared 897 patients who get Verapamil heart attack with878 people who take placebos.after 18 months followup, there be 146 deaths or recurringheart attacks Verapamil patients, compare 180 inpeople who get dummy medication.we want see if effect would be observe withverapamil, say Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen Copenhagen MunicipalHospital.If it have effect, it should be see first 12 18months, because there be big increase mortality myocardialinfarction this period, he said. then it levels off. That'swhat we demonstrated. It worked.the researchers believe that reduce amount workneeded heart sustain circulation, calcium blockerslowered chances ischemia, episodes which heart's ownmuscle be deprive oxygen.They say they be unsure why early studies fail showany benefit calcium blockers heart attacks. However,they note that some studies enrol patients who be also takingbeta blockers. And this might have obscure any benefits fromcalcium blockers.the results be presented meeting american Collegeof Cardiology. Among other research describe meeting:dr. James H. Chesebro Mayo Clinic say five-year studyfound that aspirin do not stop continue buildup existingblockages arteries feed heart, although it maymodestly protect development new deposits. However,like other studies, this one find that aspirin signficantly cutthe risk heart attacks.dr. Eugene Braunwald Harvard Medical School say nextphase large study clot-dissolving drugs will see whateffect they have unstable angina. This be condition whichpeople suffer spontaneous chest pain that be not trigger workor stress. Until now, drugs have be use only treat heartattacks.an intestinal operation lower cholesterolof heart attack patients reduce their risk another heartattack or death heart disease, researchers say today.the surgery, call partial ileal bypass, have one significantdrawback: It cause chronic diarrhea that persist years.in operation, doctors change route smallintestine so one-third it be bypassed. This reduce theamount cholesterol that be absorb bloodstream.the $52 million, 17-year study be conduct people who hadalready suffered heart attacks. The approach lengthen livesof people who have very mild heart attack not those moresevere heart damage.during average 10 years follow up, death rate amongsurgery patients who have sustain minimal heart damage be 24percent. In comparison group intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percent.dr. Henry Buchwald University Minnesota, who directedthe study, say surgery should be consider withcholesterol-lowering drugs possible standard treatment.it have role management patients highcholesterol who have have heart attack, Buchwald said. It iseminently logical extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, patients high cholesterol who have not hada heart attack.besides diarrhea, those who undergo surgery be somewhatmore prone have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinalobstructions.the study be conduct Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and publish today's NewEngland Journal Medicine.Despite wide acceptance cholesterol lowering, doubts remainabout whether it actually help people live long if they alreadyhave healthy hearts. Although late study be conductedexclusively people who have suffer heart attacks, Buchwald saidhe believe research should settle that question.it offers strong justification mark lipid(cholesterol) ineervention that have ever be offered, Buchwaldsaid. It be very powerful study and should, certainpeople who will never be satisfied, end cholesterolcontroversy.in study, 421 people who recover heart attacksunderwent surgery, while comparison group 417 people weretreated diet alone. At start study, their averagecholesterol levels be 251. The surgery lower people'scholesterol 23 percent.the overall risk die heart disease or sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack be reduce 35 percent thesurgical patients healthy hearts. The surgical patientsalso require less half many coronary bypass operationsbecause clogged heart arteries.new treatments that stop heart attack itstracks may help victims get out hospital more quicklythan ever before, perhaps three days their attacks, astudy publish today concludes.Doctors University Michigan Medical Center studiedthe effects send few carefully select heart patients homeearly. They find that these people have no unusual complications,got back work sooner and have substantially low medical bills.it be extraordinarily safe strategy, say Dr. Eric J.Topol, study's director. There be no problems anyserious events.Topol say early discharges be make possible two recentmedical advances tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, andangioplasty.when give quickly heart attack, TPA can dissolve clotsin heart's arteries and minimize damage. Angioplasty canproduce similar results open clogged arteries withtiny balloons.the report represent late steady three-decade trendof send heart attack patients home hospital evershorter stays.however, study New England Journal Medicine saidmore research be need findings be widely adopted.in 1950s, doctors recommend that patients stay inbed one two months heart attack. When PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower suffer uncomplicated heart attack in1955, he spend seven weeks recover hospital.however, doctors learn that long inactivity more harm thangood. Patients get out shape, develop blood clots and becamedemoralized.In 1960s, stay be shorten three weeks and the1970s two weeks. Now, doctors typically keep heart attackpatients hospitalize seven 10 days.In their paper, doctors determine that 80 507 heartattack patients study be healthy enough be consider forearly discharge. None them have irregular heart beats, chest painor heart failure. Treadmill test show no signs heart attackdamage.forty patients be send home three days, while reststayed seven 10 days. After six months followup, none haddied, and number medical problems groups be similar.however, people early discharge group be able returnto work two weeks sooner others, and their medicalbills be significantly low $12,546 $17,868.the researchers estimate that if 15 percent all heart attackpatients be discharge three days, annual save wouldbe least $280 million.in accompany editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, deputyeditor journal, caution that study be not largeenough spot complications that might result reducinghospital stays.this single study, he wrote, be not sufficient justifysweeping changes current management practices all patientswho may first appear have uncomplicated heart attacks.Doctors should be cautious prescribe aspirin preventer heart attack more research support its value, Food and Drug Administration said. take aspirin prevent heart attacks may increase some people's chances die other things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, agency say commentary today's Journal American Medical Association. The FDA persuade aspirin makers March refrain promote aspirin preventer first heart attacks, least now. A study publish January indicate aspirin every other day reduce risk nonfatal, first heart attack 47% 11,000 male doctors five years, compare 11,000 who take non-aspirin substitute. Aspirin tend promote bleed reduce ability blood platelets help form clots. Heart attacks occur when clots form arteries nourish heart and choke its blood supply. But aspirin may increase health risks people who already have clot problems, or those who have high blood pressure, which put them increase risk hemorrhagic strokes, FDA commentary said. Strokes be result brain damage cause bleed brain or blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes be those caused bleeding. The FDA commentary point 10 hemorrhagic strokes record 11,000 subjects take aspirin recent study, compare two such strokes 11,000 subjects take substitute. overall death rates two groups be same, though aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate be much lower. There be 104 nonfatal heart attacks aspirin users and 189 comparison group. ""Physicians, will, time, be force make their professional judgments aspirin use basis incomplete information,"" say FDA commentary, co-written agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young. ""We agree them completely,"" say Dr. Julie Buring, Harvard University researcher who participate aspirin study. She add telephone interview yesterday that extension study be way, and researchers expect report FDA late fall. The commentary note british study, also release January, 5,000 male physicians that find that aspirin fail protect heart attacks, and that it be associate 2 1/2-fold increase disable strokes.a drug use treat patients complainingof chest pain also could help prevent recur heart attacks infour out five heart patients, accord study publish intoday's edition New England Journal Medicine.Surprisingly, however, study find that drug, diltiazem,increases chance subsequent heart attack patients whosehearts pump abnormally, experts said.even so, results may trigger increase use thedrug, which be now primarily use treat angina, doctors said.the drug be test 38 hospitals United States andcanada patients who have recently suffer heart attack, saiddr. Arthur Moss, clinical professor medicine Universityof Rochester and principal investigator study.the results suggest drug may be quite effective indecreasing likelihood second heart attack majorityof patients, Moss said. But study also surprisingly suggeststhat patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be givendiltiazem because drug increases chance subsequentheart attack.we now know when prescribe this drug and when not to,Moss said. That's what this study be all about.diltiazem be calcium entry blocker, new class drugsto be introduce fight heart disease. Nitrates andbeta blockers be other types commonly prescribe doctors.the study involve 2,466 heart attack patients, who be giveneither 240 milligrams diltiazem day or placebo. patientswere recruit 1983 1986 and follow 12 52 months.Overall, drug only decrease additional heart attack 11percent, which be not statistically significant, Moss said.but patients who have normal or near-normal heart pumpfunction 1,909 patients or 80 percent total group diltiazem decrease chance another heart attack 25percent, Moss said.in patients whose hearts have pump problems, drug not onlydidn't help, it increase chance heart attack 25percent.Dr. John Schroeder, cardiologist and professor StanfordUniversity, say he be surprised that drug increase thechance heart attack any group and that overall results werenot higher.but bottom line be that this be first study showthat diltiazem can be effective, Schroeder said. I think itwill mean that more patients will be routinely put this drug ona long-term basis.dr. George Beller, cardiologist and professor theuniversity Virginia, say he be also somewhat surprise aboutthe increase heart attacks group suffer pulmonarycongestion.this be one first reports that seem identifythat, he said.diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers be introducedin decade, Beller said, and research how effectivethey be various applications be its early stages.Nitrates have be use more 50 years, and betablockers be developed 1960s.Aspirin sales jump 41 percent few weeksearlier this year, not because rash headaches.a study more 22,000 male doctors have show that take asingle aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk half.the study be one series recent reports show thefirst time that doctors be able not only treat heart attacks also prevent them.in most recent report, doctors find that one aspirin tabletand single dose clot-dissolving drug give 24 hourscan dramatically cut risk second fatal heart attack.Without treatment, patients have 13 percent chance dyingfrom second heart attack five weeks, researchersfound. With treatment, figure drop 8 percent.the real discovery be that treatment patients be go toreduce in-hospital mortality substantially, say Richard Peto ofoxford University, one study's authors.heart disease be nation's lead cause death, far.the National Center Health Statistics reports that 762,820Americans die heart disease 1987.To put it another way: Of 2,127,000 American who die thatyear, more one three die heart disease. (this do notinclude those who die blood-vessel diseases, such strokes.)the drugs most responsible recent success preventingheart attacks be new clot-dissolvers and that old standby,aspirin.the usual cause heart attacks be blockage coronaryarteries, which supply heart muscle oxygen-rich blood. theblockage arise buildup fats, cholesterol and clottedblood.Clot-dissolvers break clots, thus restore blood flow.aspirin interfere aspects clot process, help toprevent clot formation first place.the limited sales clot-dissolving drugs unitedstates show that many doctors be still not use them, despitetheir proven success. But that be begin change.some doctors predict that not-too-distant future thesedrugs will be judge so safe that they will be administeredroutinely paramedics ambulances suspect heart attackvictims reach hospital.We have know how respond quickly, and we have havethe courage use these drugs absence definitivediagnosis, say Dr. Burton Sobel Washington University St.Louis, pioneer test clot-dissolvers.the most important thing we can do be teach patients inadvance value early treatment, he says.while most public attention have focus this new ability toprevent heart attacks, researchers have also make importantprogress speeding recovery patients who survive heartattacks.Researchers University Michigan recently determinedthat some heart attack victims can be release hospital assoon three days their heart attacks. most heart attacksvictims be kept hospital least seven 10 days.the patients give early discharge be able return worktwo weeks sooner study group. After six months,not one death be record early-discharge group. Theresearchers conclude that perhaps 15 percent heart attacksvictims could be safely discharge three days.in July, Stanford University doctors find that workers who wentback their jobs seven weeks their heart attack didat least well workers who go back more typicalconvalescence 10 or 11 weeks.All these advances come time when public health expertsare increasingly emphasizing role good health and goodnutrition lower heart disease risk.early next year, American Heart Association seal approvalwill begin appear foods that be low fat and cholesteroland therefore can help reduce heart disease risk.u.s. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop July issue his firstreport nutrition, call Americans low theirconsumption fats and eat more vegetables, fruits, fish,poultry and whole grains.the report have be liken first Surgeon Generals reporton smoking, issue 1964, which focus public attention onsmoking's hazards. Koop's recommendations largely echo those theamerican Heart Association, they should help carry messageto many more people.progress research heart disease be make clear that theheart attack be no longer mysterious killer that strike withoutwarning and cannot be defend against.much can be do prevent heart attacks, great improvementsare be make treatments, and recovery be faster everbefore.the use clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save25,000 live year United States, doctors say.these results, say Dr. Peter Sleight Oxford University,will change medical practice worldwide.a natural substance call transform growthfactor beta appear be able limit damage cardiac cellsfollowing heart attack, accord study publish thejournal Science.In study Jefferson Medical College Philadelphia, agroup laboratory rats induce have heart attacks suffer 50percent less cell damage injections transform growthfactor beta rats that not receive TGF beta.tgf beta be growth factor that oppose some bad guysfollowing heart attack, say Dr. Allan M. Lefer, professor atjefferson.lefer say his research team simulate heart attacks 24 ratsby partially block key arteries their hearts.in 12 rats, researchers inject placebo. In theother 12, they inject transform growth factor beta.For those who receive TGF beta, say Lefer, damagefrom attack be much less severe. There be 50 percentless injury TGF beta it.the extent heart cell damage be determine measure theamount creatine kinase heart tissue attack.Hearts damage when blood supply be interrupted, heartattack, tend lose creatine kinase, say Lefer. Thus, bymeasuring loss this substance, researchers coulddetermine amount heart damage.lefer say TGF beta seem block action othersubstances, such tumor necrosis factor, that can cause bloodvessels narrow heart attack. Narrowed blood vesselscarry less oxygen-rich blood cells and this cause additionalinjury heart attack.tgf beta be normally present heart cells, studypublished Science say that it be miss rat heart cellsdamaged simulated heart attack.Though TGF beta be produce naturally body, Lefer saidhis research team use substance produce artificially bygenentech, California biotechnology firm.lefer say his team be now conduct additional studies withtgf beta and that any experimental treatment human heart attackvictims substance be least year away.jefferson Medical College, where study be done, be part ofThomas Jefferson University Philadelphia.Science, which publish study, be journal theamerican Association Advancement Science.The experiment also hint that blood and urine test,which measures activity blood protein call renin,might suggest new ""risk factor"" heart attacks. Abouthalf 1.5 million Americans who suffer heart attackeach year don't have know risk factors heartdisease, such high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking,obesity and high blood pressure. It be unknown whatdistinguishes these seemingly healthy people those whodon't suffer heart attacks.the blood and urine test be already be do manycommercial laboratories medical conditions other thanheart attack risk, say John H.

Leading the fight against heart disease are the new calcium channel blockers as well as new surgical procedures. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day lowers the risk of a first heart attack.","New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.","Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade. New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack. Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs. The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required. Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack. Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.  Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery. Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.","Treatments lowering heart attack deaths include drugs, surgery and tests.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery and tests to determine all show promise.  Aspirin can prevent heart attacks and clot-dissolving drugs and a substance to limit the damage to cardiac cells improve the chances of heart attack victims.","New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Drugs, surgery, and tests to determine risk all show promise.  Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half, but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people.  Post-heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack.  Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs. Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack.","New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.  Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.  The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack."

The storm caused damage in Haiti, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, but the most severe damage was in Jamaica, where 100,000 of the country's 500,000 homes were destroyed, and then the Yucatan Peninsula where the resort areas of Cancun and Cozumel were hit hard.

Although you'reasked vote nominations five pictures, I think lot ofpeople figure out that they have good chance if they just votefor their picture and leave other four blank, he said.given tremendous impact Oscar nomination and Oscarvictory have film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising thata certain degree artifice might surround Oscars.The last Emperor take $18.9 million, close half thefilm's gross, it win last year's best picture trophy.

The 1989 show is memorable for the number of films honored and for a musical number that sparked a Disney suit against the Academy.The highly recognizable statue is not protected by copyright. Walt Disney was the most-awarded person (32).","Director Spike Lee, speaking at Syracuse University Monday, shrugged off the treatment of his movie by Academy Award voters. Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories. The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers. In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.  Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting. On average a best picture award is worth about $20 million, but there is no guarantee that Academy members actually complete their own ballots.Millions watch the awards presentation. The last awards show took a long three plus hours. The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character. Though long, the 1989 ceremony will be favorably remembered for the spread of the awards. Ten movies split 17 awards. The Oscar, created in 1928, is one of the most recognizable symbols in the entertainment world and is not protected by copyright. Katherine Hepburn and Walter Brennan are the actress and actor, respectively, with the most awards.","High-stakes Oscar is prized, promoted, presented with pomp, and protected","Oscars increase film earnings, prompting studios to woo votes.

The opening daycrowds were large and  enthusiastic about the flavor of the Big Mac. The openings cameafter years of negotiations which, in some cases, stipulated that McDonald's buy itssupplies locally.","The Big Mac debuted to mixed review as McDonald's opened restaurants in Korea,Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Large crowds stood in line for hours atopenings in Belgrade, Moscow, and Peking. Customers in Yugoslavia, the firstcommunist country to get a McDonald's, and China raved about the taste of the Big Mac.In Moscow, the Russians were less enthusiastic about its taste but gave a thumbs up tothe shakes. The openings came after long negotiations which, in most cases, sawMcDonald's contracting with local farmers for the beef, potatoes and other suppliesneeded for its restaurants.","McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets. After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac. Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems. These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants. In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes. In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow. While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success. In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food. In the Soviet Union,  taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two-days wages. Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.","McDonald's ""Golden Arches"" Continues Its World-wide Expansion","McDonald's continues its worldwide expansion.

Some people and neighboring states had concerns about reunification, but after Soviet and East German communists dropped their opposition, things moved quickly to that end.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.  Western leaders saw that a reunified Germany was possible.  The East bloc communists, initially opposed to the idea, softened by urging reunification as a longer-term goal, to be reached in gradual stages.  Serious concerns about the future relations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the impact a strong, united German state would have on the evolving European integration, trepidation by neighboring states and the fears of Jews world-wide had to be addressed.  Reunification occurred.  It was inevitable.","Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.  All European and Jewish issues were addressed.  Reunification occurred.",East's Economy Sagging. Soviets Endorse German Reunification.

Street demonstrationsoccurred throughout East Germany in November 1989, and the East German CommunistParty was forced to admit the its system had failed.The West German constitution called for a united Germany, but it received little attentionuntil late 1989. The specter of a powerful undivided Germany troubled many, butparticularly the Soviets and Poles.Matters moved quickly in early 1990. Soviet President Gorbachev gave West Germanyan unequivocal promise that German reunification would be honored. Two days later, onthe 12th of February, said that negotiations with East Germany should begin as soon aspossible after the 18 March East German elections.

In country where businesspractices be not overly genteel, this be tough combination achieve. Avast media circus, meanwhile, be quick expose any flaws.sam Walton, founder Wal-Mart chain discount supermarkets who diedof cancer April, negotiate these pitfalls much better most. When,in 1985, Forbes magazine declare him America's rich entrepreneur, thepaparazzi descend obscure corner Arkansas, mainly occupy bychicken farmers, where Walton make his home.

So, extent, have lesswholesome adventures four Walton children. But no one have ever beenable make Sam himself look bad. The bad that have be say be that hewas rather dull.walton be not dash anyone's illusions. Readers will either find hisautobiography lash 'good ol common-sense and lot harmless, ifcharming, anecdotes. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makesno excuses: 'I realise this may sound bore most you,' he write onestage, 'but one my best items ever be mattress pad call Bedmate .. . .'a few snippets be more revealing character. There cannot be manybillionaires who admit that they 'never learn handwrite too well' - andhave guts include photograph which demonstrate point.meanwhile, competitive energy which Sam Walton apply his businessis inescapable.

'I have buy bank Bentonville, aboutabout Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, example, 'just little old bankwith only dollars 3.5m deposits. But it help me learn lot aboutfinancing things.' Oh, come Sam, be that whole story?the real truth, one suspects, come right end book - whenwalton admit that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have writtenthis book'. Given plead publishers - Doubleday pay Dollars4m manuscript - and rather natural desire have final say, hecan hardly be blame agree write it.

The church-goingson farmer born 1918 Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he found storechain which make him America's richest man, and which, shortly hisdeath 1992, become world's big retailer.his company, Wal-Mart, make sales dollars 55bn last year, and afterwalton's death Fortune magazine report that his wife and four childrenheld them second-largest fortune world - dollars 23.5bn.What be most startling wal-mart be speed its growth. AlthoughWalton build small chain Ben Franklin variety store franchise from1945, it be not 1962 that he open his first wal-mart discountstore.at time its incorporation 1971, wal-mart have only 38 outlets withsales Dollars 44m - not enough earn place trade journal DiscountMerchandiser's list 71 big US discount retailers. Ten yearslater, 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it be only 33rd-biggestretailer US. Its turnover be only 9 cent that SearsRoebuck, biggest, and 11 cent K mart, second-biggest. Withinanother 10 years, Wal-Mart have overtake them both.apart Walton's autobiography complete shortly his death,however, publish material company be curiously scarce. This bookattempts fill gap, provide 'scholarly account' rise ofwal-mart, set it wide context US retailing, and explaininghow it be achieved.one strength authors identify be wal-mart's ability copy and adaptfrom other retailers.Sam Walton not invent discount retailing. Rather, he realise threatdiscounting pose his variety store business and study depthmany US's lead discounters early 1960s, include Ann andhope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.Walton learn them all, be unique take his discount storesinto small towns few thousand people, where shoppers use travellinglong distances be delight have cut-price store nearby sellingeverything they needed.Another strength be wal-mart's openness technology. As early the1950s, Walton realise he be waste too much time travel and buy asmall aircraft pilot stores himself - something he continue todo end his life.sometimes, Walton be more reluctant invest technology, and have bepersuaded colleagues introduce computers, and scan check-outs -long most retailers have recognise their importance - and investDollars 20m internal satellite communications system. This technologyhelped Wal-Mart build one most efficient distribution systems anyretailer. But perhaps most fundamental reason its success, booksuggests, have be Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive managementstructure.regional vice-presidents base group headquarters Bentonville,Arkansas, rather costly regional offices, be despatch everymonday aircraft their regions, spend week visiting stores, workingwith staff and managers, and return day-long merchandising meetingevery Friday.They discuss results, problems and suggestions week 7.30ammeeting Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers torelate results. District managers hold conference call theirstore managers, and day be out, contents meet havebeen communicate all store department heads.the system mean employees can make suggestions vice-presidents one weekand, if idea be accept Saturday meeting, see its implementationbegin week.even world's most successful retailer make mistakes, however. One waswalton's decision stand chairman and chief executive's rolein 1974 favour Ronald Mayer, only return roles 1976after find he be incapable let go reins. Another waswal-mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which prove too big forgigantist America.Then there be Walton's rash promise do 'hula dance' Wall Street ifwal-mart achieve 8 cent pre-tax profit margin 1984. It did, andhe did.the book also cover well debate whether wal-mart's impact theeconomies small US towns be positive or negative.if there be criticisms, these be that this 'scholarly account' never quitecaptures sheer excitement work world's fastest-growingretailer.

The first be that it raise import prices and, result, add toinflationary pressures.the second be that it make it hard Fed engineer another cut ininterest rates stimulate flagging recovery, and raise thepossibility that rates may actually have go protect currency.the first explanation be not particularly convince - imports account fornot much more 10 cent US gross domestic product, so higherimport prices do not greatly effect overall price level, which be nowaround 3 cent and head lower.the second explanation carry more weight. Although there be not muchchance, give present economic and political climate, that Fed willraise rates help dollar, there be little doubt that currency'sweakness make it extremely difficult Fed ease monetary policyagain.the fear that Fed may be do interest rate cuts presenteconomic cycle be also sell equity markets.

The guardhouse, constructed after erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was the scene of many successful and unsuccessful attempts at escape from East Berlin and had become a symbol of the Cold War. By June of 1990 with the Berlin Wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, and with top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city after unification, U.S. officials decided it was time to remove the famous landmark. The foreign ministers attended an elaborate ceremony to honor the symbolic act. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze took the occasion to modify the previous Soviet firm opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, proposing that such a step be allowed after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. U.S. Secretary of State Baker declared himself ""underwhelmed"" by the offer, but softening of the Soviet position was a welcome sign appropriate to the occasion.",The Cold War ends as Checkpoint Charlie is lifted into history.,"As a U.S. army band played and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, Checkpoint Charlie, the symbol of the Cold War, was lifted into history today.

Although the ceremony was closed to the public, residents of the street watched from their windows.","Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous symbol of the Cold War was lifted into history today. At an invitation only ceremony attended by the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies, a U.S. army band played an old Berlin song as the checkpoint was hoisted onto a waiting flatbed truck, to be taken to a museum. Speaking at the ceremony, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for the removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city and the withdrawal of troops six months after the two German states unify. Secretary of State James Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol, expressed the hope that its removal would bury the conflicts it created. The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous. Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany. Among the invited guests was West Germany's Chancellor Willy Brandt who was mayor of Berlin in the 1960s.",,,,
